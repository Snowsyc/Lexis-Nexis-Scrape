</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a township and its officials, sought review of a decree entered in the Kent County Circuit Court (Michigan) in favor of appellee landowners in the landowners' action in equity to enjoin appellants from taking any action to classify the landowners' property in a class less liberal than &quot;C-2&quot; commercial and to permit the landowners to establish a trailer park on their property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners filed two petitions asking the township's zoning board for a change to allow them to use their vacant parcel of land, which was zoned &quot;B&quot; residential, as a trailer park. When the petitions and a third petition for a zoning variance were denied by the board, the landowners filed a suit in equity seeking injunctive relief. On appeal of the decree in favor of the landowners, the court affirmed and ruled that the township's zoning ordinance purporting to give the board power to exclude trailer parks was in conflict with the Trailer Coach Park Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.751 et seq. (1948), and was invalid. Noting that the original uniform plan for the development of the section where the parcel was located had been destroyed by the rezoning of a number of parcels within the section for commercial use, the court determined that the township's restriction of the landowners' property to residential uses did not promote the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare as required by the Township Rural Zoning Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.271 et seq. (1948). The court concluded the zoning ordinance had been nullified and the landowners were not bound by its provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff victim challenged a decision of the trial court (Michigan), which entered judgment in favor of defendant driver in the victim's automotive negligence case. The victim assigned error to the trial judge's failure to question prospective jurors to determine whether they were fellow members of the driver in a reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and automobile club.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim argued that the jurors should have been questioned as to whether they were members in the driver's inter-insurance exchange because, if so, they would have had a direct financial interest in the outcome of the case. The trial judge denied the victim's requested line of questioning based on a finding that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 522.33 (1948) and &sect; 303 of the Michigan Insurance Code of 1956, 1956 Mich. Pub. Act 218, imposed a mandatory bar to any reference to an insurance company in an automobile negligence action. On appeal, the court agreed and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The victim's claim that the statutory bar to such references was unconstitutional as an attempt to control judicial power failed, because the application of the bar in such cases had been expressly adopted as a rule of practice by the Michigan Supreme Court. Further, the latitude of voir dire interrogation was a matter of judicial discretion. Thus, the court held that as long as the statutes and court rules remained unamended, it should, as a matter of enforcement of the practice rules, uphold circuit judges when they applied the bar to suppress voir dire jury examination in violation thereof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board decided on a new courthouse site that was only partly in the county seat's limits, annexed the property, and commenced plans for construction. The court held that: (1) the Board had the right to designate a new site under 1851 Mich. Pub. Acts 156, &sect; 11, as amended, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 46.11 (1956) (Mich. Stat. Ann &sect; 5.331 (1957 Cum Supp.)), as the legislature did not establish the old site, which was donated land; (2) the Board had the right to sell the old courthouse, as Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 45.5 (1948) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5.285), did not mean that irrespective of changed needs a donor's desires should never be thwarted; (3) the Board failed to meet the requirements of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 117.9 (1954) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5.2088 (1955 Cum. Supp.)) in its annexation proceedings, as county employees living at the infirmary were qualified electors; and (4) the Board had the right under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 141.61a (1948) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5.2251(1) (1958 Rev.)), which was not an unconstitutional delegation of power, to use for building purposes miscellaneous surplus funds, as distinguished from funds raised by taxation beyond the Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners appealed from the order of the circuit court (Michigan), which dismissed their bill in equity against defendants, city and officials, to challenge the validity of an annexation. The circuit court declined to exercise equitable jurisdiction because there was an adequate remedy at law contained in ch. 38, &sect;&sect; 27-30 of the judicature act of 1915, as amended, codified at Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; &sect;&sect; 638.27-638.30 (1948).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners alleged that the taking of their lands by the city violated their due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and Mich. Const. art. 2, &sect; 16, and also was an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of unconstitutionally delegated power. The landowners did not cause the attorney general prosecutor to file an information or petition and they did not file a petition for relief in the nature of quo warranto within 30 days of the election that approved the annexation as permitted by ch. 38, &sect;&sect; 27-30 of the judicature act of 1915, as amended, codified at Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; &sect;&sect; 638.27-638.30 (1948). On appeal, the court did not address the merits of the landowners' bill. The court found that the bill disclosed no ground for the intervention of equity and failed to disclose the inadequacy of the legal remedy. The court held that the landowners were not entitled to equitable relief because the bill did not present any question that could not have been submitted and litigated under an information or petition if the landowners had filed in a timely manner as provided by the statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A circuit court (Michigan) denied plaintiff steamship owners' action to enjoin defendant city from prosecuting complaints against the owners for allowing the emission of smoke in the city's port in violation of a municipal ordinance. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted an ordinance prohibiting the emission of smoke of a certain density. When the city attempted to prosecute steamship owners, they sought to enjoin the prosecution. The owners claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutional because their vessels operated in interstate commerce and were under the control of the federal government. The lower court refused to issue the injunction, and the court affirmed. In order to determine whether the ordinance was preempted by federal legislation governing interstate commerce, the court was required to determine whether the federal legislation and the ordinance pertained to the same subject matter. The court found that federal legislation regulating the steamships was intended primarily for the protection and safety of the vessels and their passengers, crew, and cargo. The purpose of the ordinance, however, was to protect the health and welfare of the city's citizens by preventing the emission of dense smoke into the air that the citizens breathed. Therefore the ordinance did not regulate interstate commerce and did not conflict with federal legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner erected a manufacturing building on a lot zoned for light industrial. Seven years later, the city amended the zoning ordinance and, in so doing, cut off a strip of the land, restricting it to residential and leaving the remainder to industrial. The landowner was later denied a building permit for the sole reason that it would have injured the surrounding land as desirable residential land. The court held that the action of the city in running the district boundary line across the landowner's lot so as to restrict the rear segment to residential uses was not necessary to any general zoning plan of the city. The restricted segment of the lot was landlocked; it was too small for platting and subdividing profitably. The extra expense in acquiring rights-of-way for access roads, and extending sewers and water lines before the plot itself could have been reached, made the lot financially unsound to develop for residences. Therefore, the action of the city amounted to a confiscation of property rights in violation of state and federal constitutional provisions, as being arbitrary, unreasonable, and discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court had no jurisdiction to issue the injunction because exclusive jurisdiction over the parties' dispute rested with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) pursuant to &sect; 10(a) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The employer's franchise agreement was closely supervised by the national franchisor and the employer's purchases outside the state were over $ 246,000. Therefore, the injunction was void for want of jurisdiction. The court further held that because it had no jurisdiction, it could not consider whether certain of the union's acts constituted a contempt of the void injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver ran into a car driven by the decedent, killing the decedent, his wife, and two children. The driver was transported to the hospital, where a sample of his blood was taken for blood alcohol analysis while he was unconscious. The administrator sought recovery under the state death act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.691 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27.1461 et seq.), for the decedent's three surviving children. The trial court entered judgment for the administrator. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that payments for insurance or social security benefits did not offset the amount of damages to be paid by the driver because they were solely for the benefit of the survivors. The court also held that under Mich. Const. art. II, &sect; 10, the taking of the driver's blood for analysis violated of his rights, and that testimony based on the blood analysis should not have been admitted. However, the admission of that evidence was not grounds for a reversal because the driver's negligence was established by other evidence, including the driver's admissions about drinking and the state trooper's observations that the driver appeared to be under the influence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it followed that the townships may not validly contract as in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 123.742 (1948) provided, without specifying any limit as to the rate or amount of the levy.

The circuit court dismissed the taxpayer's action. The city and the taxpayer appealed. The court reversed and remanded and found that the authority was created to defeat the constitutional limitation by political contrivance. The court found that the authority was not a municipal corporation, within the meaning of the 15-mill amendment, at the time that the 15-mill amendment was passed. The legislature had the power to create any entity and call it a municipal corporation, but only those types of entities that were municipal corporations at the time of the amendment were able to escape the limitations of the 15-mill amendment.

Comp. Laws &sect; 450.305b (1952) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21.208(2) (1952)).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A railroad challenged the state's imposition of a franchise tax upon its business.  Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 450.305b (1952) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21.208(2) (1952)) permitted the state to consider the railroad's interstate business when it calculated the state tax. The state corporation and securities commission calculated the tax, which the corporation tax appeal board approved. On appeal, the railroad argued that the commission had miscalculated the tax, that the tax violated the federal commerce clause, and that the railroad had already been taxed on its property under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 207.5 (1948) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.255 (1950)). The court explained that the tax had been correctly calculated. That the calculation took interstate business into account did not mean that the tax violated the commerce clause. The tax did not concern interstate commerce: it was a straightforward franchise tax on the railroad's privilege of doing business in the state. Nor did the railroad's payment of the state's ad valorem tax, a property tax, result in double taxation. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners of the lands executed a quitclaim deed to the corporate trustee under a trust mortgage and later executed a warranty deed for the same lands to the department.

The lands were sold to the purchasers, but upon receipt of copies of the deeds to the department, the state determined that the purchasers had not received marketable title and filed a quiet title action against them. The court reversed the decree and remanded the case for additional proceedings. The court held that the owners' deed to the trust company was not simply a security device that did not convey absolute title. Therefore, the trial court correctly held that the warranty deed transferred no interest in the lands, because once the owners executed the quitclaim deed there was nothing to convey to the department. The court rejected the purchasers' claim of ultra vires because the corporate trustee had the power to accept land titles under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 487.204 (1948) (Mich. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state tax agency sought review of judgment entered in the lower court (Michigan) that held that appellees theater operators' sale of tangible personal property within their buildings did not constitute a chain store operation that would allow imposition of a retail vending tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state tax agency imposed a tax on the theater operators' retail vending operations within their buildings based on a claim that they were operating a chain of stores by selling tangible personal property at counters contained within their stores. The lower court determined that the imposition of the tax was not a chain of stores under the meaning of the taxing statute and not subject to the tax. On appeal, the theater operators argued that it was not taxable because it operated counters, not stores, and the operation of the counters was not carried out under separate ownership. The theater operators also argued that the placing of the counters in a different classification due to the fact that their ownership was the same as the theater operators constituted a violation of Mich. Const. art. 10, &sect; 4 and the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. 14, &sect; 1. The court rejected this argument and found that the counters was a chain of substantial business operations that operated under a unity of control and ownership that was taxed differently than businesses without such unity of ownership and control. Thus, the tax imposed was not arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court affirmed. The court agreed with the commissioner that a necessity hearing did not involve the adjudication of a contested case. The court found that the quantity of land to be taken in connection with the improvement rested in the reasonable discretion of the condemning authority, the commissioner. The court determined that the city's approval of the change in highway had reference to a certain route and it could be assumed that it was taken with knowledge as to the statutory powers of the commissioner in improving the relocated road. The court determined that it was not essential to the validity of the resolution that it should undertake to specify by metes and bounds the property that might be taken for that purpose. The court concluded that the trial judge correctly found that there was a proper basis for the determination of necessity as made by the commissioner.</SPAN></P>

The corporation was qualified as a foreign corporation in the various states where it did business. The corporation and securities commission applied an annual corporate franchise tax against the corporation for business conducted within and without the borders of Michigan. The appeal board found that a substantial part of the overall business activities of the corporation were conducted within the State of Michigan and that the corporation's steel stocks in its investment portfolio were used for its overall business, including its Michigan business. It was the court's opinion that the factual findings of the board were amply justified on the record before the court. The interrelationship between the corporation's steel stocks and its overall business, including its operations in Michigan, was clear and clearly established. It had been the court's consistent holding that the Michigan corporate franchise fee was a tax imposed upon the privilege of doing business within the state in a corporate capacity.</SPAN></P>

The labor union members filed an action challenging their expulsions from the labor unions. The trial court denied the labor unions' motion to dismiss.

The court held that the labor union members' complaint was sufficient to state a cause of action for equitable relief and that raised issues that were too involved to be decided on a motion to dismiss. The court also rejected the labor unions' contention that their motion to dismiss should be granted on the strength of the sworn allegations included in the motion because their motion was to dismiss, not for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The builder sought to construct 37 prefabricated houses. The builder's application for a building permit was refused by the town building inspector because its plans failed to comply with the township building code in three respects. The builder, claiming equal or greater strength and safety as to the disputed features, sought a writ of mandamus to compel the town to issue the building permit. At trial, the builder agreed to amend its plans to provide footings for the chimney so as to comply with the code requirement. As to the other two issues, the trial court heard the testimony and viewed a house constructed according to the builder's plans. It held that the two provisions of the building ordinance in their relationship to the builder's plans bore no reasonable relationship to the health, safety, and welfare of the community and, hence, were unconstitutional. The writ prayed for was issued conditioned on the builder's prior amendment of the application to comply with the chimney provisions of the code. On appeal the court affirmed. The court held that, because the evidence clearly showed the unreasonableness of the ordinance, a writ of mandamus was a proper remedy.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, without a hearing, found the wife in contempt, ordered that she be institutionalized, and granted custody to the husband. The wife challenged the decision, and the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court affirmed the contempt citation because it was undisputed that that the wife denied the husband visitation. The court reversed the order of institutionalization and change of custody. The limited record did not contain the minimum factual requirements for a finding of mental illness. Two physicians found mental illness and one did not.

According to the court, the township board's refusal to grant the corporation approval to construct a gypsum manufacturing plant in the industrial zone was against the preponderance of the evidence and was arbitrary and capricious. The court held that the corporation never received more than a cursory hearing before the township board and was improperly denied its right to review. The court also held that the township board failed to establish that the proposed plant would be more injurious to the surrounding neighborhood than normal industrial uses or that the plant would be detrimental to community health, morals, or welfare.</SPAN></P>

The business owner challenged such differentiation because he had an oversized sign, and sought to enjoin the city from enforcing the ordinance. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance, and ordered compliance with its provisions, or removal of the sign. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that it would not rule on the objection to the ordinance unless and until it had before it a marquee or fixed awning owner who complained of the discrimination. Because the business owner had a sign, not a marquee or awning, he was not in a position to object. The court noted that exception in favor of theaters and hotels could not be criticized, for those places were clothed with a public interest, and it was proper, and in fact to be desired, that such places be enabled to have proper signs on their marquees for the benefit of the traveling public and theater-going public.</SPAN></P>

When the trial court ruled in favor of the property owners, the city sought review. On appeal, the court held that the authority to determine zoning and planning decisions rested with the city and not the courts, unless the city acted arbitrarily or unreasonably. Since a reasonable basis existed for the city's decisions, the court held, the trial court's ruling was improper. The court reversed the trial court's ruling, finding in favor of the city.</SPAN></P>

After the petition was filed, the city adopted a zoning ordinance which zoned the property for residential purposes only.

The circuit court found that the ordinances were unconstitutional and granted the writ. On appeal, the court held that the ordinances were neither unreasonable nor unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the oil company failed to prove that the ordinances were unreasonable, confiscatory, and bore no reasonable relationship to the public health, safety, welfare, and morals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owners appealed an order of the trial court (Michigan), which upheld an ordinance of plaintiff township in the township's action to restrain the development of the owners' commercial gravel mining operation in an area zoned for residential purposes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners purchased the subject property in 1951 in anticipation of expanding their existing mining operation to that property when the original property was exhausted. At a special meeting in 1952, the township enacted a zoning ordinance that zoned the subject property as residential. The township then sought to restrain the owners' mining activities on the subject property, and the owners filed a cross-bill to enjoin the township's interference with the mining activities. The trial court upheld the ordinance, and the owners appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the ordinance was valid and the deleterious effect of the mining operation upon the surrounding area was clear and it was not curable by the proposed curtailed operations. The court found that it was not reasonable to contend that the prohibition of gravel mining operations in the residential area was clearly arbitrary and unreasonable or that it had no substantial relation to public safety, health, or general welfare. The intent of the owners, prior to the zoning, to mine the subject property did not constitute a prior nonconforming use to &quot;vest&quot; the owners' interest in mining the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The storage corporation owned and operated a warehouse in the city of Detroit and stored in the warehouse certain farm products. The corporation claimed that the board, in disregard of the exemptions set forth in 1956 Mich. Pub. Acts 9(14), included the farm products in its assessment roll. The corporation filed a petition for a writ of mandamus with the court, and an order to show cause and temporary restraining order was entered. The board filed an answer to the petition for a writ or mandamus and a motion to dismiss. The common council of the city was also added as a party. Upon review, the court issued the corporation's request for a writ of mandamus. The court held that the corporation made a prima facie showing of damages by reason of the fact that the board sought to tax the stored farm products. Further, the court ruled that the corporation was a proper and interested party, affected by &sect; 9, and that the corporation had no other adequate remedy at law other than mandamus or prohibition to stay irreparable damage. Finally, the court determined that the statute was constitutional and was passed by the legislature to encourage the flow of commerce into the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township asserted that the trial court erred in refusing to enjoin the junk yard because the ordinance regulated businesses that affect the public health, welfare, and morals and the junk yard's violation of the ordinance was a nuisance per se. The court rejected the township's contention, finding that the junk yard was not a nuisance because there was insufficient evidence to support the township's allegation. The court noted that it did not have jurisdiction to restrain a threatened violation of the ordinance unless, if the act were carried out, it would be a nuisance. The court held that there was no showing of any public health problem because the conduct of the junk yard business, the character of the area, and the nature of the various organizations within the vicinity did not establish that the junk yard was responsible for the smoke, noise, and odors in the area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court.

While on parole from that sentence he again committed the crime of armed robbery for which he was sentenced on July 5, 1940, to a prison term of 10 to 30 years. Defendant State contented that under PA 1937, No. 255, ch. 3, &sect; 8, Mich. Comp.

The court held that plaintiff was, in the language of PA 1953, No 232, &sect;&sect; 34 and 38, Mich. Comp.

The property owners had filed an action against the township concerning the validity of &sect; 118, which restricted the use of the easterly 200 feet of their property to residential purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' property consisted of about 30 acres of vacant land that was located on the west side of a road. The property had about 1,600 feet of frontage on the road. The trial court held that the frontage on the road, for a depth of 200 feet, was not restricted to residential use. However, the trial court did not disturb the residential restriction set forth in &sect; 118 as it applied to the remainder of the owners' property. The township admitted that the road was a high speed, heavily traveled, arterial highway. The proofs disclosed that approximately 15,000 vehicles travel the road each day, at an average speed of 55 miles per hour. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that each zoning case was determined upon its own facts and circumstances. The facts in the appeal sustained the conclusion of the trial court that &sect; 118 did not apply to the easterly 200 feet of the owners' land fronting the road.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants sought to have their property rezoned as commercial for the purpose of selling to a purchaser intending to build an auto theater. The township granted the applicants' petition for reclassification. Township voters thereafter filed a petition requesting that the question of reclassification be submitted to the electors for their approval or rejection on a referendum vote. The trial court held that the provisions of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 125.282 and 125.284 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 5.2963(12) and 5.2963(14), did not confer the right of referendum as to any amendments to the zoning ordinance and that such a grant would be unconstitutional as an improper delegation of legislative power to the electors. The court disagreed, holding that the elector approval required by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.282 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5.2963(12)) was not confined to the question of whether a zoning ordinance would be adopted but extended to the type or kind of zoning ordinance that would be adopted.

Defendant contended that plaintiffs were not entitled to mandamus because they did not file an application for a permit with the state health commissioner. Defendants also contended that the township's zoning, which precluded trailer parks, was a reasonable and justifiable exercise of police power. The trial court granted the writ. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that in order to file an application for a permit with the state, a township clerk's signature was required which the clerk refused to provide. The court held that the township was precluded from raising objection to mandamus on that ground. The court further held that the trial court was correct in its finding that trailer camps were not nuisances per se or detrimental to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare so that their prevention did not promote those goals and was not a reasonable exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the federal government occupied the field entered into by the state law to the extent that the federal laws superseded the enforceability of the state law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual submitted the petition to defendants because he desired to circulate the petition to obtain a sufficient number of signatures of qualified and registered electors to propose a constitutional amendment relative to garnishment. Defendants refused to approve the petition, taking the position that the law did not require them to approve the form of a petition until after it had been circulated and the signatures obtained. The main issue was whether any defendant had a duty to pass upon the petition before it was circulated for signatures. The court held that Mich. Const. art. 17, &sect; 2 made it the legal duty of the Secretary of State or other authorized officials to check the petition prior to the time that it was circulated, signed, and filed. The court also determined that the board of State canvassers had the same duty to look over the petition that was filed by the individual. However, the Attorney General and the director of elections were under no such duty and therefore they could not be compelled to receive and check the petition that was filed by the individual.</SPAN></P>

The government brought suit against the city to recover the taxes, contending that the tax statutes were unconstitutional because they constituted an ad valorem general property tax on real property owned by the government in violation of the United States Constitution. The trial court entered a no cause of action judgment against the government, and upon review, the court affirmed. The court held that the tax statutes had no application independent of the lessee's enjoyment of the privilege of using the real estate in connection with its business conducted for profit, and that the tax was, therefore, not an ad valorem tax on real property of government. The court held that the tax was a specific tax on the lessee's privilege of using it and, hence, valid.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence showed that defendant's restaurant was the rendezvous of the conspirators and that defendant paid money to the employees of the conspirators. The court held that the facts shown and the inferences drawn from them, were of sufficient importance to present a question of fact to the jury as to the knowledge of and participation of defendant in the conspiracy to transport cigarettes into Michigan without paying the tax thereon.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village adopted Trenton, Mich., Ordinance No. 117 (1944), which provided for a comprehensive zoning plan of areas located within its corporate limits. Thereafter, the village adopted Trenton, Mich., Ordinance No. 157 (1952), which amended Trenton, Mich., Ordinance No. 117 (1944). Trenton, Mich., Ordinance No. 157 (1952) upgraded an area of three blocks from a classification that permitted single and two-family dwellings and multiple dwellings for three or more families to a classification that permitted single and two-family dwellings. The owner had three lots that were located within this area. The court found that the owner's indisputable showing of spot discrimination, coupled with the complete absence of fact or inference in the record tending to show a relationship of Trenton, Mich., Ordinance No. 157 (1952) as applied to the public health, safety, or welfare, dictated affirmance of the decree of the circuit court. The use-complexion of the neighborhood in the vicinity of and including the three-block area remained uncharged compared with the situation as it stood in 1944.

The contract for purchase of lot eight was later paid up. The other contract was never fulfilled, although payments on it were made by the buyers for a time. In affirming the decision, the court found that the seller was clearly guilty of a material violation of the plat act of 1929, as amended, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 560.1 et seq. Further, contracts made in violation of the plat act were at instance of the purchase void. The court found that no action or inaction on the part of the buyers otherwise constituting waiver or estoppel would prevent them from alleging the invalidity of the contract or seeking recision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted that he had not complied with the rules, not having sought or obtained leave to appeal. Defendant relied on Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 650.1 (1948), as amended by 1954 Mich. Pub. Acts 53, to argue that he was entitled to a writ of error of course and an appeal, without first filing an application for and obtaining leave to appeal. The court held that if defendant's construction were adopted, it would repeal 1927 Mich. Pub. Acts 175, ch. 10, &sect; 3, which provided that writs of error in criminal cases were to issue only in the discretion of the state supreme court on proper application therefor. Such a repeal by implication, and perhaps by inference and indirection, was not favored in the law. 1954 Mich. Pub. Acts 53 offended Mich.

The board denied the landowners' petition. The court affirmed the trial court's decision granting judgment for the landowners. The court held that the ordinance was fatally defective. The board was simply given authority to permit, and obviously to refuse to permit, the erection of gasoline stations after public hearings. However, there were no standards that prescribed the grant or rejection of the permission. Where a zoning ordinance permitted officials to grant or refuse permits without the guidance of any standard, but according to their own ideas, it did not afford equal protection. While the exercise of discretion and judgment was to a certain extent necessary for the property administration of zoning ordinances, this was so only where some standard or basis was fixed by which such discretion and judgment could be exercised by the board. Where a zoning ordinance was vague and indefinite, it could not be sustained as valid under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.401 et seq.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the evidence that established his identity as the driver of the speeding automobile was obtained as the result of an unlawful stop on the highway by an employee of a private detective agency. Defendant also argued that the employee was not authorized by law to arrest or stop persons for the commission of offenses other than felonies, except when summoned to assist a peace officer, pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 764.17 (1948). On appeal, the court affirmed and held that no prejudicial error occurred on trial that would have entitled defendant to reversal of his conviction of speeding. The court ruled that defendant had not sustained his burden to prove that the person that stopped him lacked authority. The court concluded that the authority of a deputy sheriff of the county to arrest or stop defendant for a misdemeanor committed in the officer's presence could not have been questioned. Mich. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners were in the storage, hauling, and long-distance moving business and used the property for their vehicles and moving equipment. The city adopted a new ordinance that zoned two of the owner's parcels as residential. This deprived the owners of the use of these two parcels in their business. The two parcels were vacant, unimproved property that was adjacent to dirt alleys. One of the parcels was virtually landlocked insofar as it could be used for residential purposes. The owners' witnesses showed that the best and most profitable use to which both parcels could be devoted would be for business or commercial purposes. The owners unsuccessfully attempted to have the city rescind their action. A prosecution was started against the owners for violation of the ordinance. In reversing the decision, the court found that the ordinance as applied to the owners' property was unreasonable, confiscatory, and illegal.

The ordinance was, rather, in the nature of an assertion by the city that it had such an interest in the preservation of the trunk-line road, which was one of the main thoroughfares through the city. Thus, the city was entitled under its constitutional authority to impose restrictions and limitations with reference to the use of such road and the safety of those traveling thereon.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that a court of equity should not interfere to prevent the board of supervisors from performing the duty expressly vested in it by statute. The legislature intended to vest the board of supervisors with the authority to pass on the legality and sufficiency of annexation petitions. In the event of an affirmative finding in such respects, it was the board's duty to adopt a resolution for the submission of the question of annexation.</SPAN></P>

The board filed a motion to dismiss the action, which was granted by the trial court. The optometrist sought review, and the court affirmed. The court held that the statute was not overly vague. For example, the court said that &quot;grossly&quot; introduced no new or different charge, but related solely to a matter of degree. Also, the court said, the words &quot;of a character likely to deceive the public&quot; were words of definite and certain meaning and sufficiently explicit to inform the people as to conduct that would render them liable to statutory penalties. The court found that &quot;unprofessional&quot; and &quot;dishonest conduct,&quot; while not necessarily vague, were defined in the statute.

Defendant permitted the police to look in his truck, where it was discovered that defendant was unlawfully carrying the cigarettes. Defendant was charged with possession and transportation, but defendant's motion to dismiss was granted on the grounds that the arrest and subsequent search were illegal. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the stop was lawful because the weighmaster was authorized by statute to stop defendant. The court further held that defendant's volunteer of the information, unmarked truck, as well as his offer to &quot;fix it up,&quot; provided police with probable cause to believe he was committing a felony and justified the warrantless search.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that requiring defendant to produce the gun would not force him to unconstitutionally incriminate himself. The court ruled that the privilege against self-incrimination applied to evidence in a civil proceeding which might subject the witness to criminal prosecution. The court concluded that the privilege against self-incrimination applied only to testimonial compulsion, which did not include production of objects such as the gun. The court noted that defendant's interrogatory answers disclosed information about the gun and the privilege should have been asserted at that point. Noting that defendant disputed the distance between the parties when the shooting occurred, the court found that should not be allowed to withhold the best method of ascertaining it once he put the distance at issue.</SPAN></P>

Approximately 16 years after the inmate's conviction, the judge permitted the inmate to withdraw his original plea and accepted the inmate's plea of guilty of second degree murder. The judge sentenced the inmate nunc pro tunc. Because the inmate had already served the term of the new sentence, the judge served a subpoena duces tecum on the corrections officials. The officials filed the instant proceeding, and the Attorney General intervened on their behalf. The issue was whether the judge's action was a judicial invasion of clemency power or merely the performance of a judicial function. The court held that the judge's action constituted permissible judicial action because the original verdict was invalid, and the judge had the power to accept the subsequent plea and resentence the inmate. Moreover, the judge properly credited the inmate with time served under the void sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff bee farmer's suit in chancery to restrain the enforcement of CL 1948, &sect; 286.13 (Michigan) and CL 1948, &sect; 286.18 (Michigan), which prohibited the importation of bees and used apiary appliances into the state, defendant agriculture director appealed a decree of the trial court (Michigan), which held the act unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner contended that the challenged statutes prevented the spread of contagious or infectious diseases among bees and was a valid exercise of the state's police power. The court held that a law enacted by the state to prevent the spread of contagious or infectious diseases among animals was a valid exercise of police power, and that the right of properly constituted public authorities to destroy property deemed likely to spread disease was well established. The court further held that the act in question did not bar the importation of bees and honey, but barred their importation in combs, and in used hives and equipment. The court concluded that the state, in the exercise of its police power, had the right to regulate the manner by which bees could be imported into Michigan, that the requirements under the challenged act were in the interests of public health, and as such were within the applicable constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it constituted an unlawful delegation of authority.

The court found that the disputed ordinance was substantially the same as the ordinance considered in another case in which the court rejected the same claims of unconstitutionality. The court rejected the property owner's attempts to distinguish that prior decision and held that this prior decision controlled. In addition, the court held that the disputed ordinance was passed under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 445.451 et seq.

The landlord filed a complaint against the city and sought an injunction. Her complaint was dismissed and she appealed. On appeal, the court set aside the order and remanded. The court stated that the landlord's complaint set forth grounds for equitable relief other than the restraining of criminal proceedings. It involved the right of the city to invoke the provisions of the building code and thereby order the landlord to remove all installations from the third floor and to refrain from using it for living quarters. The landlord had also alleged that the city, as public officials, was proceeding illegally and improperly under claim of right, caused her irreparable injury, and challenged the reasonableness of the threatened action. The court stated that the landlord did not challenge the validity or constitutionality of the ordinances in their entirety, but only as they were applied to her property. The court held that because on the city's motion to dismiss the well-pleaded facts in the complaint were accepted as true, the landlord was entitled to a hearing on the complaint's merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant joint tenants appealed a determination of a circuit court (Michigan), which granted the petition of plaintiff public utility under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 483.1 et seq. (1948) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22.1341 et seq. (1953)) for the condemnation of a right-of-way for the pipeline transportation of petroleum products across defendants' land. The order fixed defendant's compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility's proposed pipeline ran across state lines into Canada. It allowed the importation of crude oil into Michigan, where it could be processed if adequate facilities were built, but also allowed for the transportation of oil to out-of-state locations. In its condemnation petition, the utility claimed that the right-of-way was necessary for the construction of the pipeline. On orders from the circuit court, the Michigan Public Service Commission determined that public necessity existed for the taking of the right-of-way, and the circuit order entered an order accordingly. On appeal, defendants asserted that the Act only gave eminent domain powers to utilities that transported oil in state. The court held that the title of the Act did not suggest the limitation and the legislature had not explicitly stated that the Act applied only to the in-state transportation of oil. The profit of private interests from the utility's business was incidental and did not amount to the utility's exercise of eminent domain powers for a private purpose. The utility's submission to the Commission's jurisdiction was an adequate state control over the pipeline.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's order that granted the utility's petition for condemnation of a right-of-way across defendants' property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bill of complaint alleged that the board of education failed to comply with the requirements of Mich. Comp.

The court, however, found that none of the situations, which required a consent vote under the statute were present here. According to the court, the statute did not require a consent vote when property was detached from one district and added to another. The State, through its legislature had granted certain powers to county boards of education and the action taken in this case was by virtue of those powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank sought a declaration that its suppliers were exempt from sales tax on personal property they sold to the bank. It claimed that it was exempt as an instrumentality of the federal government and that imposition of the tax on the retailer was imposed on the government when the retailer passed it on to the bank. The trial court upheld the requirement that the proceeds from sales to the bank be included in the retailers' gross proceeds for sales tax purposes. The court affirmed, finding that the retailers were not excused from including sales to the bank in their gross proceeds as the bank was an incorporated instrumentality of the United States, not a wholly owned agency of the federal government. Further, the legal incidence of the sales tax was imposed on the retailer, not the bank, for the privilege of engaging in the retailers' businesses and that the department collected no tax from the bank. Finally, the passing on by the retailer of the economic burden of paying sales taxes did not violate the bank's constitutional immunity or statutory immunity, as the retailers were not required to collect the tax from its purchasers.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the petition had contained a proper description of the area to be annexed, that each signer of the petition had the opportunity to inspect a map attached to the petition before signing the same, and that persons who signed the petition on behalf of corporations had the authority to do so. The court also refused to hear the appellants' objection to the absence of signers from the city because the issue was not raised at the hearing before the board of supervisors or before the trial court.

Pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 450.301 et seq. (1952), the corporation paid a franchise tax to the Commission. The corporation computed the tax by including only transactions in which the cargo was transported between Michigan ports. The Commission changed the computation by including all transactions in which cargo was either loaded or unloaded in Michigan. The corporation asserted that the tax violated the corporation's privilege of carrying on interstate and foreign commerce under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court held that the Commission violated the Due Process Clause by including cargo transported in interstate and foreign commerce. The tax was a privilege tax, and the cargo tonnage transported in interstate and foreign commerce was separable from the tonnage shipped intrastate. Although the court did not find Mich. Comp.

On appeal, the court affirmed the decree dismissing the complaint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was notified that he was being terminated from his employment. He requested a hearing and the request was granted. A hearing was held but the employee was still terminated from his position. The employee filed his application for a writ of mandamus that challenged the legality of his discharge. The trial court issued the writ and the mayor appealed. On appeal, the mayor argued that the trial court was without jurisdiction to review the discharge of the employee by means of mandamus rather than certiorari. The court noted that the employee was complaining of administrative actions. A writ of mandamus was used where the law had established no specific remedy. The court determined that the sole remedy available to the employee was certiorari and not a writ of mandamus. A writ of certiorari was the mechanism necessary to review the mayor's actions in dismissing the employee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner contended that the state had the authority to investigate traffic conditions and prohibit parking in the interest of public safety and convenience. The court held that the reasonable control of streets reserved to cities under Mich. Const. art. 8, &sect; 28, did not give them exclusive control, preventing the state from assuming any control over state trunk line highways running through cities. The court further held that the state, by the establishment of a trunk line highway which included the street in question, thereby assumed an obligation to the people to the state in general to see to it that the street in question, together with the trunk line in general, was so maintained and controlled as to be reasonably available for the flow of traffic. The court concluded that commissioner's order prohibiting parking on the highway was a proper one under the facts shown in the record, and declined to determine that it was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The shipper challenged the constitutionality of the statute under which the department proceeded on the principal ground that it contravened Mich. Const. art. 5, &sect; 21 (1908). The shipper claimed that because the immediate effect clause of the act was null and void, he could not appeal under the provisions of the act without recognizing the validity of the act. The court held that insofar as the shipper alleged that the department was proceeding illegally because the statute creating the judicial authority was unconstitutional, the issue could properly be determined by certiorari. The court further held that the writ of certiorari was a discretionary one, and that its issuance by a court having authority would be upheld in the absence of an abuse of discretion. The court also held that the propriety of the issuance of the writ was not properly raised on a motion to dismiss, that the shipper was not compelled to follow the appeal procedure set up in the statute which he assailed, and that he properly proceeded to make an independent attack on the statutory proceedings by the use of certiorari.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction to the county circuit court, which quashed the trial court proceedings and discharged the defendant. The prosecution sought further review. In reversing the circuit court judgment, concluded that the fact that the complaint filed against the defendant referred to &sect; 724 of the Motor Vehicle Code rather than to &sect; 716 or &sect; 722 was immaterial. The defendant was charged with operating a motor vehicle that was carrying a load that exceeded the weight restrictions imposed by law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, plaintiffs sought to restrain the Michigan Public Service Commission from proceeding against or interfering with their right to haul the company's merchandise in leased motor vehicle equipment. A similar restraining order was sought in the second case. The company had manufacturing plants throughout the country, and it used leased motor truck equipment to make its deliveries in Michigan. The company employed the driver. The Commission apprehended a number of the company's drivers and issued violation tickets because of the company and drivers' refusal to make application to and obtain a permit from the Commission. The Commission classified the drivers as &quot;contract motor carriers of property.&quot; Michigan's motor carrier act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 475.1 et seq. (1948), did not apply to plaintiffs. Neither the company nor its drivers were carriers of passengers or property for hire over the highway. The requirement of the Commission that applications be made to it and permits for the operations issued by it, was a nullity. No authority existed under the act for the seizure of the motor vehicles.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the court found that the city denied the employee his previous job because of rumors that he had been a poor policeman. The court found that there was no evidence that the employee was no longer able to perform his previous job.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Rule 35, &sect; 6, gave the trial court the authority to compel pretrial discovery.

The court held that the rule was constitutional, because equal protection only guaranteed that a law would be enforced equally across a reasonable classification. The court next held that the husband's property and finances were relevant to the divorce proceedings. The court held that although a divorce suit typically proceeded in two phases, discovery relevant to the property distribution and support phases was not bound to await the resolution of the liability phase.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute applied to operation of a motor vehicle by a &quot;contract motor carrier.&quot; Defendant argued that it merely leased the vehicle to another and did not operate a motor vehicle as a contract motor carrier. The court stated that in 1945, the Act had been amended to broaden the definition of &quot;contract motor carrier&quot; to include a person who leased the vehicle; however, the title to the Act, &quot;An act to promote safety upon and conserve the use of the public highways of the State; to provide for the supervision, regulation and control of the use of such highways by all motor vehicles operated by carriers of passengers and property for hire upon and over such highways,&quot; had not been changed. Under Mich. Const. art. 5, &sect; 21, no law was to embrace more than one object, which was to be expressed in its title. Here, although the 1945 amendment attempted to reach the business of vehicle owners who leased their vehicles to third parties over whom the owners exercised no control whatsoever, neither the title nor the purpose of the Act covered such business.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance required that as a condition of granting of a license for a used-car lot, the applicant was to obtain a written statement from a percentage of the surrounding freeholders recommending that the license be granted. The circuit court found that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was an improper delegation of legislative power. Reversing, the court stated that it did not agree with the circuit court that there was an unlawful delegation of legislative power to the freeholders. The ordinance itself did not require the township to grant the license upon the recommendation of the freeholders or to deny a license in the absence of a recommendation. The power to grant or deny the license rested with the township, notwithstanding the statement, waiver, or recommendation required to be submitted with the application. Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 445.502 (1948) provided that the township could refuse to grant a license in its discretion for just cause. The circuit court erred in holding that the ordinance was a void and unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board denied the landowner a building permit because Canton Township, Mich., Interim Zoning Ordinance art. 5, &sect; 1 and Canton Township, Mich., Bldg. Code &sect; 5 prohibited trailer parks in the township. Six weeks after the landowner sought mandamus relief and in compliance with the Michigan Trailer-Coach Park Act (Act), Canton Township, Mich., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 3.12 (1950) was adopted and prohibited new trailer parks in the township. The trial court denied the landowner's petition because he failed to comply with Canton Township, Mich. Interim Zoning Ordinance art. 5, &sect; 1 and Canton Township, Mich., Bldg. Code &sect; 5. On appeal, the landowner contended that Canton Township, Mich., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 3.12 (1950) constituted an unconstitutional taking of private property because it outlawed a lawful business. The court affirmed, holding that the landowner's petition was properly denied because, unless it had express legislative authority to the contrary, the township had a duty to enact &sect; 3.12 in order to comply with the Act. The court implied that the Act was not a blank prohibition and that &sect; 3.12 applied only to land that could not be used for trailer park businesses.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the creation of the authority in 1945 Mich. Pub. Acts 47, 1949 Mich. Pub. Acts 62, and 1952 Mich. Pub. Acts 170 did not impair the city's right to self-government. Under Mich.

The legislature had the authority to promulgate the subject acts because they involved health and because they were not local in nature, they did not require the vote of the local electors for approval under Mich.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The builder sought to recover the balance due on a contract between the parties.

The builder argued that 1945 Mich. Pub. Acts 315 requiring him to obtain a residential builder's license were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that the act clearly and unjustly discriminated in favor of trustees, banks, trust companies, building and loan associations and savings and loan associations, as against all other persons in the same class doing residential building operations. The corporations mentioned Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 338.704(g) were entirely exempted from obtaining a license before they built on any property to which they held title or had an equitable title or in which they had a financial interest, a very important discrimination in favor of such corporations.

Const. art. 4, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2, which divided the state government into three departments: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial, and forbade any person belonging to one department from exercising powers properly belonging to any other except in cases expressly provided for in the Michigan Constitution. The township contended that justices of the peace, though judicial in nature, had sat on township boards for over 100 years. The court agreed with the clerk and affirmed the judgment of the trial court holding &sect; 70 violated the Michigan Constitution. The court held that &sect; 70 attempted to vest justices of the peace, officers possessing judicial power, with legislative and administrative power given to the township governing bodies and that on its fact, &sect; 70 violated Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 2 to the extent that it constituted justices of the peace as members of a township board. The court stated that a township board was in no sense to hold any connection with the judicial department of the government.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent had been the beneficiary of a trust created in the other state for the purpose of managing real property located in that state.

The decedent and the trustee had executed an amendment to the trust, which in substance conformed to the trust agreement, that provided that, upon the death of the decedent, the beneficial interest would pass to a religious organization. The administrator brought his proceeding for a determination that the transfer of the trust proceeds to the religious organization was not subject to the Michigan inheritance tax act, Mich. Comp.

The court concluded that the statute, as applied to nonsigners, bore no reasonable relation to public health, safety, morals, or the general welfare. Although both the manufacturer and the retailer were Michigan residents, the court noted that the manufacturer's price-fixing scheme was national in scope and, because it affected interstate commerce, it came within the inhibition of the Sherman Act.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 411.1 et seq (1948). The claimant had filed an application for a hearing and an adjustment of a claim for a back injury sustained while working for the employer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant strained his back and chest muscles while lifting a heavy box. He was unable to continue employment and received compensation for six weeks. Three years later, the claimant sought an adjustment of claim with the Commission as a result of the earlier accident, which was granted. On appeal, the court found that the award was not proper because the claimant's disability was not the result of an accident. The court found that the disability resulted from an attempt to lift a toolbox that, because of his general arthritic condition, was beyond his strength. Thus, there was no accident involved, and his disability was not the result of incidents or hazards peculiar to his employment. Under part 2 of the workmen's compensation law, a non-accidental injury was not compensable. An amendment to that part by 1943 Mich. Pub. Acts 245 did not include non-accidental injuries because such an amendment would have violated the one object rule of Mich. Const. art. V, &sect; 21. Therefore, the aggravation of a previously existing non-occupational disease such as the claimant's arthritic condition was not compensable because the aggravating injury was not accidental in nature.</SPAN></P>

The city and the commission established by Ordinance 213-E authorized a condemnation proceeding for the construction of a parking facility that would also contain floor space for 22 retail stores that were to be leased by private vendors. The proposed construction fell within the statutory guidelines. In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the public construction of private retail space would have caused them irreparable injury. The city urged that the retail stores space were incidental to the public use. The common law and Mich. Const. art. 2, &sect; 16 prohibited an eminent domain proceeding from using condemned property for other than a public use, even with just compensation. The court reviewed case law that established that when the public and private use of condemned property were inseparable, the government's taking was not permitted. That revenue taken from the rental of the stores was credited to the parking facility did not render the stores public.</SPAN></P>

The State claimed that &sect;&sect; 1, 3, 4, and 5 of the 1950 Act constituted an encroachment upon the judicial powers of the court by the legislative department of the State. The court found that as originally adopted in 1939, the Criminal Psychopathic Act contained provisions mandatory in form with reference to the conducting of the prescribed inquiry and the commitment of one found to have a mental disorder. In the 1950 Act, the legislature did not undertake to say that the trial court had to substitute one sentence for another as a punishment for crime if defendant was found to be a criminal sexual psychopathic person. The legislature did not undertake to interfere with the exercise of strictly judicial prerogatives in the trial of cases.

Comp. Laws &sect; 436.26c (1948), declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 26c of the Act was directed at &quot;bottle clubs&quot; and required a license for the sale of alcoholic beverages, mixers, and ice.

They contended that &sect; 26c was unconstitutional and sought to enjoin defendants from taking any action against them pursuant to &sect; 26c. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint. On appeal, the court rejected all of plaintiffs' contentions. The court held that &sect; 26c did not violate the &quot;one object&quot; requirement of Mich. Const. art. 5, &sect; 21 because the statute was within the scope of the title of the Act and did not have more than one object. The court further held that the express exclusion of hotels from the operation of the statute did not constitute a violation of plaintiffs' equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the people failed to prove that she was not any one of the parties enumerated in the statute who were permitted to possess such drugs.

Laws &sect; 767.48 (1948), it was not necessary to aver the negative allegations. The court held that it was not necessary for the People to allege or to prove the negative allegations. Defendant urged that the People had to prove a container in which the barbituric acid was dispensed. Such barbituric acid could not be dispensed without a container, and the fact that the pills found in defendant's possession were not in any container was proof that they were not in their original container. Defendant argued that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 335.102 (1948) was unconstitutional because it placed an undue burden on her by compelling her to testify against herself contrary to Mich.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees and the union contended that the Act was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the lower court's determination that the Act was constitutional. The court held that (1) the Act was constitutional and it was applicable to the employees of the city's street railway system, (2) after the strike the city does not have to offer and give the strikers an opportunity to return to work under the terms, conditions, rights and benefits under which they were working before they struck, and without the penalties imposed by the Act, so accept them; and continue to treat them as employees, and (3) under the Act, and after the strike, the city did not have a legal duty to mediate, and continue to mediate, with the returned strikers under the Michigan labor mediation board. The court's primary consideration in addressing the constitutionality of the Act was whether a public employee had a protected property right in initial and/or continuing employment. The court recognized that public employment did not vest in such employees any fixed or permanent rights of employment, and that under the common law, there was no right to strike on behalf of public employees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a special election, the city school district acquired certain property that had been within the general school district.

The general district filed a declaratory judgment action in order to determine the status of certain outstanding bonds. The trial court dismissed the general district's action. On review, the court found that prior to the special election the general district had issued bonds for the purpose of building an addition to a school. The court found that Mich. Rev. Stat.

Furthermore, the city district had indicated that it was willing to accept its obligations and pay the general district's debts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners purchased a large house and the surrounding acreage from their father's estate. They sold the acreage in accordance with the zoning. They were unable to sell the house and claimed that they were unable to maintain a tenant due to the cost of its maintenance. The zoning for the owner's property called for single family dwellings. The owners sought a variance claiming that the house was of such proportion that it was no longer suitable and could not be used for a single residence or for any practical use permitted by the dwelling district. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly denied the owner's petition for mandamus. The court determined that the zoning classification was reasonable as applied to the owners' property and that the ordinance was valid on its face. The zoning ordinance was not illegal because it did not render the property almost worthless. Although the market for the house was very limited, it did not follow that the property could not be used for single-residential purposes.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court found that the condemnation was constitutional. The court determined that the slum clearance was for a public purpose, and even though there was going to be a resale of the land by a private person, the resale was incidental and ancillary to the primary and real purpose of the clearance.

It also held that the statute was not arbitrary or unreasonable, nor did it impermissibly impair the ability of parties to contract, since all contracts were subject to the state's police power to prohibit any trade or employment which would be injurious to its citizens or to the best interests of society. The order of the lower court, denying relief to plaintiff, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad claimed that the continued operation of the two passenger trains was not required for public convenience and necessity and unjustly and unconstitutionally deprived the railroad of its property. At the Commission hearing, the railroad presented evidence that the operation of the two trains resulted in substantial losses. It showed that other railroads and a bus carrier provided passenger service between the two towns. The Commission ordered that the railroad continue the operation of the two trains because its passenger service losses were offset by income received from its freight services on the same routes. The trial court affirmed the Commission's order, finding that the railroad failed to show a lack of public convenience and necessity. On appeal, the railroad contended that the Commission's order was arbitrary and unreasonable. The court granted the railroad's request to discontinue the passenger trains, holding that the Commission's order was unreasonable and confiscatory because there was clear and convincing evidence that the economic loss resulting from the trains' operation overbalanced whatever convenience the public derived from the trains.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court disagreed and dismissed the landowners' complaint. On appeal, the court held that the landowners met their burden of showing that the limitations imposed by the ordinance were unreasonable as applied to their property. The fact that the township wanted to establish an aesthetically pleasing residential neighborhood was insufficient to overcome the landowners' claim that the ordinance imposed arbitrary and unreasonable restrictions on the use of their property.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the place where the paper was physically printed was less important than where it was distributed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department attempted to tax the taxpayer's deposits in banks located outside of Michigan, its notes and accounts receivable, and stocks the taxpayer held in other corporations. The Department contended that the taxpayer was a unitary enterprise and that the tax in controversy was not imposed differently as applied to residents conducting a unitary enterprise from nonresidents not conducting a unitary enterprise. In affirming, the court held that the taxpayer's intangibles were acquired before 1946. Therefore, the court determined that such items should have been excluded from the intangible tax. The court noted that the Department failed to show that the intangibles were part of the working capital of a unitary corporation. The court found that the Department lacked the power to tax intangibles that were owned outside Michigan and that reflected past earnings or income that were permanently located outside of Michigan. The court concluded that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 205.131, 205.42 (1948) were invalid and void under the circumstances so far as taxation of the taxpayer's intangibles that did not have an actual situs in Michigan were concerned.</SPAN></P>

Pub. Acts No. 300, &sect; 513. Plaintiff then filed his petition for mandamus. The secretary averred in his return to the show cause order that under the act, a discharge in bankruptcy was not a satisfaction of judgment and the running of the statute of limitations did not discharge a judgment. The court denied the writ of mandamus, holding that the act was not unconstitutional and that the state had the right under its police powers to control automobile traffic. The court found that it was the legislature's policy that a discharge of a debt by bankruptcy and the statute of limitations did not relieve the debtor from the act's requirements. The court reasoned that, in each case, the moral obligation to pay a just debt remained, but the power to enforce payment was stayed by operation of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company filed an action for injunctive relief, challenging the legality of a Commission order that prohibited it from selling natural gas directly to local consumers without first obtaining a certificate of convenience. The company argued that the Commission's order usurped the federal government's power to regulate interstate commerce. When the superior court granted the requested relief, defendants sought review. On appeal, the court vacated the superior court decree and affirmed the Commission's order. The court relied on a then-recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that had construed the federal Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 717, as permitting state regulation of consumer sales of natural gas transported via interstate commerce. The court rejected the company's contention that it was entitled to make such sales without first procuring a certificate of convenience from the Commission, noting that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 460.502 (1948) expressly prohibited a public utility company from rendering any service in any Michigan municipality where any other utility was rendering the same sort of service without obtaining such a certificate.</SPAN></P>

On remand, the trial court (Michigan) directed issuance of a writ of mandamus to the village, which required it to pay the lot owners $ 716.63, the balance on hand in the village treasury of all collections on the original special assessment, but denied a writ to require the village to reassess against any of the lot owners. The village filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand, it was stipulated that there were 277 lots in the assessment district, that 86 had gone through scavenger sale, that the assessments had been paid in full on 113 lots as originally levied, and that the owners of the remaining 78 lots had availed themselves of the benefits of the tax moratorium act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.301 et seq. (1948), paying the assessments over a 10-year period without penalties and interest. The trial court held that the 113 lots on which the assessments had been paid when due were not liable for reassessment. Additionally, the 78 lots on which the assessments had been paid under the moratorium act were not liable for the reassessment. The court affirmed. The 113 lots had already borne their full proportion of the cost of the improvement as originally imposed and to require them to bear, in addition, the deficiency caused by payment of the assessments on other lots under the moratorium act, freed from interest and penalties, would have been to violate Mich. Const. art. 10, &sect; 3 (1908), the uniformity clause. A holding that the 78 lots were subject to the reassessment would have defeated the purpose of the moratorium act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city commission adopted a resolution to issue general obligation bonds, in addition to self-liquidating revenue bonds previously issued and sold, so as to provide sufficient funds to construct and pay for a proper sewage-treatment system and also a garbage-disposal plant. The city treasurer contended that the method and procedure used by the mayor to raise the funds with which to carry out the order of the stream control commission were illegal. The treasurer specifically contended that the issuance of the general obligation bonds had to be approved by a three-fifths majority of the qualified electors of the city after due notice had been given to them in the same manner and to the extent that was required for issuance of other general obligation bonds issued under the city charter and by the home-rule act. The court held that the injunctive relief that the mayor sought was appropriate as the action of the commission was in strict accord with the court's peremptory order for the installation of a sewage-treatment system. The city was bound to carry out the order of the court, which confirmed the previous order of the stream control commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer had nonprofit-producing intangibles which were owned and held by trustees in Pennsylvania. In computing the intangibles tax owed by the taxpayer, the trial court included these interests and increased the taxpayer's tax by $ 21.58. In her motion for reconsideration, the taxpayer asserted that the trial court erred in computing the intangibles tax she owed by considering her interest in the trust's gross income, rather than its net income, in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and Mich. Const. art. 2, &sect; 16, by depriving her of property without due process. The court held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 205.132 (1948) allowed a tax on income-producing intangible property in the amount of three percent of the income, and &sect; 205.131(d) provided for the computation of that tax on the gross income. Computing the tax on the taxpayer's interest in the gross income of the intangibles in Pennsylvania was proper. However, the trial court erred in its judgment by stating the wrong amount by which the taxpayer's assessment was increased. The resultant increase was only $ 7.09, rather than $ 21.58.</SPAN></P>

The passenger filed a complaint seeking damages for her injuries. Pursuant to Mich. Comp.

The administratrix appeared specially and moved to quash service of the summons and to dismiss the cause, asserting that &sect; 256.521 was unconstitutional and that service did not confer jurisdiction over her. The motion was denied. On appeal, the court found that statutory provisions for service of process on a living nonresident were constitutional and not violative of due process and jurisdiction over the nonresident could have thus been acquired. Section 256.521(1948) was based on agency. Such agency was based on the inherent police power of the state and was not revoked by the decedent's death.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that where the two constitutional amendments that created the Commissions conflicted, the civil service amendment, which was adopted later in time, was controlling. The Liquor Control Commission was created in 1932 by Mich. Const. art. 16, &sect; 11. The Civil Service Commission was created in 1940 by Mich. Const. art. 6, &sect; 22.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The act basically subjected any person, place, or item, in that person's possession or under his control to a warrantless search merely upon the officer's reasonable belief that the person in question had been, was, or was about to be engaged in hunting, fishing or trapping of wild life or was in possession of such wild life or apparatus, but without probable cause to believe that such person had been or was violating the law. The court denied the writ of mandamus holding that Mich. Const. of 1908, art 2, &sect; 10, secured the person, houses, papers and possessions of every person from unreasonable searches and seizures. The court held further that those provisions of the act which allowed an officer to search anyone at anytime violated the constitutional provision against such unreasonable search and the state's argument that the persons obtaining fishing and hunting licenses had surrendered their constitutional rights failed because the act did not require that the person being searched possessed a license.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the jury was unlawfully and illegally constituted and that he was thereby denied the right to trial by jury guaranteed by Mich. Const. art. 2, &sect;&sect; 13, 19. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that there was compliance with Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 602.135 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27.260) in the drawing of the jurors' names even though the names were not covered up when drawn. It was not error to deny defendant's motion for a new trial based upon the fact that three jurors were not persons assessed on the assessment rolls because there was no showing that they could not act impartially. It was not error to admit into evidence the so-called intent bills because it was necessary for the jurors to have some understanding of the scheme of corruption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state agriculture department employee purchased a package of yellow oleomargarine from defendant's store. Defendant was informed that &sect; 288.241 prohibited the sale of colored oleomargarine. Defendant challenged his conviction, alleging that the federal laws on the subject of oleomargarine preempted all conflicting state legislation and that &sect; 288.241 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that because the federal standard set forth in 6 C.F.R. 2762 made the coloring ingredient optional, the federal regulation only partially preempted the field. Therefore, there was no conflict between the federal regulation and Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 288.241 (1948). Defendant also argued that &sect; 288.241 bore no reasonable relationship to the state's police power because oleomargarine did not harm the public's health. The court found that &sect; 288.241 did not prohibit the sale of oleomargarine but merely regulated it. Thus, &sect; 288.241 was within the state's police power and constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled the zoning violated the Fourteenth Amendment and Mich. Const. art 2, &sect; 16. The court noted that the record showed that the property fronted one of the best streets in the city. The court concluded that the area was one of the choicest and nicest residential districts in the city. The record showed no violations of the zoning ordinances or restrictions. All dwellings built in the area were single residences. The court ruled that the developer did not establish by competent evidence that the ordinance's classification of its property was unreasonable or had no relation to public health, safety, or the general welfare. The court concluded that the improvement of residential districts by the exclusion of nonconforming businesses had a reasonable relationship to the public health, welfare, and safety.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1947 Mich. Pub.

The Act set out criminal penalties for a violation of the Act. When negotiations broke down between the employer and union over wages, the union called a strike without complying with the Act. The court held that the election requirements of 1947 Mich. Pub. Acts 318, &sect;&sect; 9, 9a, 9b, 9e, did not violate the union member's rights of freedom of speech and due process of law as guaranteed by Mich. Const. art.

The court further held that Congress, in the National Labor Relations Management Act (NLRMA), had not so preempted the field of the regulation of labor-management relations in industries affecting commerce that any state police power regulation of such relations conflicted with federal law and were therefore null and void.

The decree authorized the commissioner, in accordance with a prior federal court decree, to levy additional assessments to pay principal and interest due on bonds that financed construction of an underground drain within the county drain district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding that the lower court had properly entertained the commissioner's petition, the court affirmed the decree and remanded but did not award costs because the case involved a public question. The court noted that the commissioner was not bound by the federal decree that would have permitted assessments on &quot;scavenger lands.&quot; The court found that the new assessments were proper since they were based on what the remaining lands would have been assessed had &quot;scavenger lands&quot; been included in the calculations. The court rejected the contention that ch. 9, &sect; 3 of the Michigan drain law, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 4917 (1929), Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11.81, was unconstitutional. The court found that the new assessments were not arbitrary or capricious and that the benefit to land from a drain is hard to measure. The court held that since there had been opportunity for hearing at the time of the first assessment and the new assessments were based on the same percentages, the statute did not violate due process in not providing for new hearings. The court further held that municipalities could be required to pay their full assessment even if they had not yet collected their drain taxes.</SPAN></P>

The notice did not set forth any other reasons for the revocation. The trial court found that &sect; 18 was unconstitutional, but that other provisions of the city's ordinance were sufficient to justify revocation.

The court held that revocation of the operator's license would have been fully and amply justified, and that the city's ordinance contained sufficient other provisions so as to fully justify the revocation without considering &sect; 18.

The trial court also held that the exemption of the garage from taxation was unconstitutional and that parking meters were a public transportation utility that had to be paid for and maintained solely from their revenue. The city appealed, and the court vacated the decree, holding that the use of the subsurface area of the boulevard for parking was a proper highway use and, thus, the landowner was not entitled to any compensation for such use in the absence of the widening of the boulevard or other damages to the landowner's property.

The court found that the 1948 Mich. Pub.

The charity asserts that many religious, charitable, service, patriotic and other nonprofit organizations were operating bingo, raffles, and lotteries in the city without being molested by the police, but that the charity had been singled out for discriminatory enforcement of the anti-gambling statute. Defendants moved to dismiss. The trial court accepted the allegations of the bill of complaint as true and stated that the court believed itself to be without jurisdiction to restrain defendants in that the charity's operations constituted a game of lottery, a game of chance and was gambling. The trial court dismissed the complaint finding that the charity had an adequate remedy at law and was also of the opinion that plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law and entered an order dismissing the bill of complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment finding that equity would not intervene to prevent enforcement of a valid criminal statute to aid the violation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The beneficiary argued that all rights of the insured, her ex-husband, in the policy in dispute were assigned to her by a divorce decree, and that she had the right to surrender the policy and receive the cash surrender value. The insurer argued that the policy provided that any assignment of the policy or its benefits was void, and the divorce court, in an action in which the insurer was not a party, could not assign the policy or its benefits to the beneficiary. The trial court entered a judgment for the beneficiary in her action seeking to recover the cash value of the policy. On appeal, the court found that the legislature could not give the divorce court the right to decree that the beneficiary could substitute her personal judgment and discretion for the discretion and judgment of the insured on the subject of electing to surrender the policy and receive the case value. The trial court could not render its decree under the authority of a statute that was enacted after the contract had been entered into if the decree substantially impaired the contract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, board of pharmacy and its individual members, revoked the certificates of registration of plaintiff pharmacists.

The court disagreed and affirmed the trial court's order. The court stated that the pharmacists' certificates were issued to them as a result of an error in determining whether they were lawfully entitled to certificates of registration under Mich. 2 Comp. Laws &sect; 6860 (1940). Under such circumstances, the authority of the board to revoke the erroneously issued certificates was expressly conferred by Mich. 2 Comp. Laws &sect; 6845 (1929). And, the pharmacists' contention that the statute was unconstitutional because they had a vested property right to practice as pharmacists in consequence of pharmaceutical certificates of registration having been issued to them and because of their unchallenged general qualifications was without merit. The court held that the pharmacists could not have and did not acquire vested rights as a consequence of having been issued certificates of registration in violation of the law.</SPAN></P>

On review, the issues were whether the act applied to a chocolate drink or set a standard for a chocolate drink, and whether the act was a proper exercise of the police power, or was it unreasonable and arbitrary so as to violate due process. The court reversed. The court found that the act clearly and specifically prohibited the sale of any milk chocolate drink with less than 3 percent butterfat. The court determined that the primary purpose was to fix a standard for chocolate milk irrespective of the name it might be called and it only prohibited sale of products that did not comply with the standard. The court determined that all the sellers had to do was to comply with the standard to sell chocolate drinks. The court found that there was at least sufficient showing of danger of fraud to the public to warrant the legislative action because the containers were the same as those used for milk and chocolate milk which complied with the minimum standards set by statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs contended that the trial court was in error in holding that the streets sought to be vacated, had become a part of the county highway system. Plaintiffs argued that the proofs indicated that public money had not been expended in the improvement or maintenance of the streets, and that prior to the action of defendant board of county road commissioners in 1938 there was no official action by public highway authorities recognizing or declaring the streets to be township highways. It appeared that the public accepted a portion of the street offered, took possession of it, and used it. The trial judge found from the proofs before him that the procedure outlined had been strictly followed with reference to the taking over of streets which plaintiffs sought to vacate, and that the streets had become an integral part of the county highway system. Plaintiffs claimed no rights by virtue of adverse possession. The court held that plaintiffs' claim that it was the duty of the trial court to grant them the relief sought was untenable.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the existence of the conspiracy to violate the gaming law was established by competent evidence. One defendant was seen coming out of a headquarters on two evenings; he was seen on several occasions carrying a paper bag that was used for carrying the betting tickets. The second defendant was carrying a bag with betting tickets when he was arrested. The court rejected defendants' argument that the gambling paraphernalia seized under search warrants could only be admitted to proved the commission of the misdemeanor gambling and not the felony for which they were convicted.

The court held that the claimant's duties were ministerial, not judicial, and that the placing of the position of the claimant under the county civil service act did not constitute an encroachment upon or interference with the judicial branch of government by either of the other two branches.

The trial court upheld the validity of the Act, and the taxpayers appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the Act was valid because under the plain language of &sect; 3 the rule of uniformity did not extend to property paying specific taxes. To the contrary, the state legislature was given authority to impose specific taxes, which were uniform as to the classes to which they applied. The court rejected the taxpayers' argument that the shares were exempt from the tax under a catch-all provision in the Act because the Act provided in express terms for a specific tax on the ownership of shares of corporate stock.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school district filed a petition to condemn property adjacent to land it already owned and used in its operations. The land was owned by defendant private, nonprofit corporation and there was a small house. The school district selected as its method of procedure that prescribed by Mich. 1 Comp. Laws &sect; 3763 et seq. (1929). The nonprofit corporation appealed after the trial court (Michigan) denied its motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nonprofit corporation cared for homeless boys, and used the house on the property as living quarters and a study hall for those boys who used the school district's educational facilities. The nonprofit corporation's institution was located in another county. The court ruled that the school district had the authority to select, out of the 17 methods of eminent domain proceedings in Michigan, the one that it chose. The court explained that the method pursued by the school district was proper, and was not in any way affected by the school district's authority to pursue a different method. The court added that the method selected did not require the school district to attempt to purchase the property first. Rejecting the nonprofit corporation's argument that the property could not have been condemned because it was already used for a public purpose, the court noted that the nonprofit corporation was private, and it was not a government agency supported by public funds or holding government property or having the power of eminent domain. Therefore, the court found nothing immunizing it from the superior right of eminent domain that had been given to the school district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying the nonprofit corporation's motion to dismiss the eminent domain proceeding and remanded the suit for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A company operated a public coach transportation system under a franchise granted by a municipality. When the company rejected the union's demands, the union notified the labor mediation board of the existence of a labor dispute, which might lead to a strike. Pursuant to Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.454(14), the judge was designated chairman of an arbitration board. The court granted the union's petition to prohibit the board from conducting proceedings. The court held that compulsory arbitration of labor disputes involving public utilities was, under the police power, constitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, especially where there was a clear and present danger to the public interest. However, because the Act required the appointment of a judge to the arbitration board, the Act violated the fundamental principles of division of the powers of state government under Mich. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2 and art. VII, &sect; 9 (1908). The court held that the judge was not acting in his individual capacity as a member of the arbitration board. Because the Act added a new duty not judicial in nature to the office of circuit judge, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the Act was constitutional, upheld defendants' rights to seize the fish, and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court upheld the dismissal. The court stated that the Act had previously been held to be constitutional, therefore, there was no purpose to repeat the prior decision. The court indicated that the fishermen were subject to violations of the Act because they were not reselling the fish at a dock along the shores of Lake Erie.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Michigan State Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors and its members challenged a judgment of a trial court (Michigan), which denied their motion to dismiss plaintiff funeral director's complaint, claiming that Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.508(1) et seq., (1947) was unconstitutional. The Board argued that the funeral director had an adequate remedy at law and that his complaint did not set forth a cause of action for equitable relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the funeral director had charges of unprofessional conduct filed against him, the Board revoked his license to engage in the business of embalming and funeral directing. Instead of appealing the revocation, the funeral director filed the subject action, claiming that the act under which his license had been revoked, Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.508(1) et seq., (Cum. Supp. 1947), was unconstitutional in that it was an improper exercise of the State's police power. The Board claimed that the funeral director failed to state a cause of action, contending that his only course of action was to appeal the revocation of his license to a circuit court under Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.508(10) (Cum. Supp. 1947). The court held that the funeral director's action was proper to determine whether Mich. Stat.

The court further found that equity had jurisdiction to restrain the enforcement of &sect; 14.508(1) et seq., and that the funeral director was not bound to pursue a remedy under &sect; 14.508(1) et seq., the validity of which the funeral director assailed, by way of appeal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendants contended that after permitting the taking and sale at docks along Lake Erie of 13-inch pike-perch, it was unconstitutional for the legislature to prohibit its resale elsewhere in the state. The court rejected defendants' argument and held that with ownership of wild game reposing in the state, and individuals enjoying only such limited ownership as the state granted, the state's refusal to grant unqualified ownership with all the incidents of ownership, such as the right of sale, was not, as defendants urged, the taking of property without due process of law. The court further stated that while the statute might not have insured equality of places nor of enjoyment, there was, under it, an equality of right, for all persons, to take the type of fish in question from Lake Erie and to buy or sell them at docks along its waters.

At the hearing, the agent challenged the right of the secretary to proceed, as there was no properly verified complaint before him. Testimony was then taken from the agent, exhibits were incorporated into the record, and an order was entered suspending the agent's license. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the secretary was empowered to hold an investigation, give notice, and conduct a hearing on its own initiative. Further, the notice properly advised the agent of the nature of the charge against him and the reference to a verified complaint did not affect the notice or the hearing held on that notice. In addition, there was sufficient evidence to support the finding that the vehicles were correctly classified as new, even though the dealer purchased them from a new car dealer, as the cars had not been used to such an extent as to render them second-hand cars.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 8485-4 provided that workers who refused to submit to periodic complete physical examinations when silicosis, pneumoconiosis, or a dust disease was found would be barred from benefits under part 7 of the Michigan Workmen's Compensation Act. The trial court declared that &sect; 8485-4 was constitutional. On appeal, plaintiffs argued that &sect; 8485-4 created an unreasonable classification by imposing more severe penalties upon workers in the dust industries and that the terms of the section were vague and uncertain. The court vacated the trial court's order and held that &sect; 8485-4 was unconstitutional. Although &sect; 8485-4 created a classification for dust industry workers, the legislature had authority to regulate certain industries and not other industries, and had not abused that authority in enacting &sect; 8485-4. However, it was doubtful whether a complete physical examination would disclose the presence of a dust disease, which disclosure was the object of &sect; 8485-4. Further, the penalty of barring workers from compensation was unrelated to the purpose of the section and could operate in perpetuity; &sect; 8485-4 thus contained indefinite, uncertain, and unreasonable provisions.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer argued that the State owed the city approximately $ 200,000 per year for each year of the university's existence as reimbursement for city services provided to the university. On appeal, the court held that the State was immune from suit. The university's tax exempt status was legal under Mich. Const. art. 11, &sect; 5 (1908).

While lifting a 150-pound box one day, he felt a click and a sharp pain in his back. He was able to work until his usual quitting time that day but was not able to work thereafter. The Department found that the claimant's disability did not arise from an aggravation of a pre-existing condition, but stemmed directly from lifting the box. The court stated that it would not disturb a finding of fact by the Department that was supported by competent evidence. Stating that the next question before was whether the injury was compensable because there was no happening of an accident or fortuitous event, the court concluded that it was compensable. It stated that when the Workmen's Compensation Act was amended in 1943, the term &quot;injury&quot; was repeatedly substituted for the words &quot;accident&quot; and &quot;accidental injury.&quot; This, along with reasons mentioned in other cases, indicated that it was the legislative intent, in enacting the 1943 amendment, that disabilities resulting from personal injuries that arose out of and in the course of employment should be compensable, even though not occasioned by an accident or fortuitous event.</SPAN></P>

The challenged ordinance provided that in a B2 district there could be generally recognized retail stores and uses accessory to the same, while among uses permitted in a C commercial district were killing, handling, and sale of poultry. The citizen argued that the zoning ordinance as construed by city officials was arbitrary and unreasonable as applied to their particular property. The citizen claimed that the killing and defeathering was an incidental and integral part of the operation of a poultry market. The trial court held the ordinance valid. On appeal the court affirmed. The court found that it was the purpose and intent of the ordinance to confine such activity to a district other than where the citizen's poultry market was located. The court held that the killing and defeathering of poultry was not an incidental and integral part of the operation of a poultry market, especially where the ordinance provided that this activity should be confined to a C or commercial district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the policemen were employed by the city, they contributed funds for their pension. The city amended its charter to reduce the amount of pensions to be paid to the policemen. The policemen claimed that they had fulfilled all of the conditions required of them to receive the pension and that they had a vested right to future payments, of which they could not be deprived by subsequent legislation. On appeal, the court held that no binding contract was entered into on the part of the city with the policemen and, therefore, the city was permitted to change the amount of the pensions. The policemen had no vested rights in the pension and the pension was terminable at the will of the city, at least while acting within reasonable limits. At best, the policemen had an expectancy based upon continuance of existing charter provisions. The policemen entered the employment of the city with the full knowledge that the charter provision could be amended at any time. Neither policeman had any express contract that an irrevocable pension was part of his salary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer's motion to dismiss the employee's compensation claim was based on its argument that it was not subject to the Act because it had not elected to become subject to it. On appeal, the court upheld the Commission's order denying the employer's motion and remanding the case to a deputy commissioner for a hearing on the merits of the employee's claim. The employer, a constitutional corporation, was an incorporated public board under part 1, &sect; 5 of the Act, Mich. 2 Comp. Laws &sect; 8411 (1929), as amended by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 8411 (Supp. 1945) and under Mich. Const. art. 11, &sect; 7. Consequently, the employer was subject to the Act under part 1, &sect; 2 of the Act, Mich. 2 Comp. Laws &sect; 8408 (1929), as amended by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 8408 (1945). The employer was not afforded immunity by the Michigan Constitution and was expressly included among the entities subject to the Act.

Plaintiffs' presumption that there were two separate primaries for state and county offices was incorrect. The trial court correctly acknowledged the purpose of a primary election. The statute applied statewide to every partisan race. It was not directed at defendant county, nor charter counties in general. The statute was a general law and not a special or local act within the meaning of Mich. Const. of 1963, art. VII, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought paternity action against defendant. Parties entered a court-approved settlement agreement requiring defendant to pay plaintiff but not acknowledging paternity. Later, after former Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.713 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25.493) (repealed June 1, 1997) was held unconstitutional, plaintiff moved to set aside the agreement. Defendant argued that the decision should not be applied retroactively, but the court disagreed and eventually granted a default judgment of paternity against defendant after failing to submit to ordered blood tests. The court held that: (1) defendant's claims of financial reliance on the agreement were insufficient to outweigh his son's right to financial support; (2) settlement agreements were modifiable if their subjects had not yet reached the age at which their right to parental support had terminated; and (3) because the statute in effect specifically contemplated entry of default, default judgment of paternity was proper and not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a medical doctor, was tried and acquitted of manslaughter for the death of his infant son. The trial and extensive media coverage prompted defendant bureau of occupational and professional regulation to open a file on plaintiff. Although no formal complaint was ever filed, plaintiff sought access to the information defendant had compiled, under the state Freedom of Information Act. Defendant asserted that some of the information remained confidential under an exemption for information obtained before any complaint is issued. Plaintiff obtained an injunction to prevent the destruction of any of the records, but the trial court then granted summary judgment to defendant. Reversing, the court held that the disclosure exemptions did not apply because, while no complaint was issued, defendant's effort to collect information was only a preliminary review and did not amount to an &quot;investigation&quot; as defined in the Public Health Code. The information was subject to disclosure.</SPAN></P>

On the defendant's motion, the trial court suppressed the evidence and dismissed the charges, ruling that the search was defective because the warrant left at the scene did not include an attached affidavit, as required by the statute. A three-judge appellate court upheld the decision, but could not agree on a rationale. One judge wrote that binding precedent required that the evidence be suppressed, a second judge concurred in the result only, and the third judge, dissenting, wrote that the trial court erred and that its decision should be reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals of four criminal cases, appellant prosecutors challenged the orders of the Oakland Circuit Court and Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan), which declared that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 769.1(1) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.1072(1)), requiring the circuit court to sentence certain juvenile offenders as adults, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees were juveniles charged as adults. One pled guilty, the other three were awaiting trial. All filed motions for determinations that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 769.1(1) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.1072(1)) was unconstitutional. The circuit courts granted the motions, appellant prosecutors challenged, the cases were consolidated, and the court reversed. The cases were ripe because appellees faced real and immediate threats. The statute did not violate separation of powers because, although a prosecutor's decision to charge a juvenile as an adult would result in an adult sentence upon conviction, the court still had discretion over the sentence. The statute did not violate equal protection or due process protections because no intentional discrimination was demonstrated, and adults had no right to a pre-charge hearing. The statute reflected substantive policy, so, although it conflicted with Mich. Ct. R. 6.931, it did not infringe on the state supreme court's procedural rulemaking authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Orders were reversed and remanded for further proceedings; the statute permitting juveniles to be charged as adults was constitutional because it did not violate the separation of powers doctrine, appellees' equal protection or due process rights, and it did not infringe on the state supreme court's rulemaking authority.</SPAN></P>

Ordinance 925 was unconstitutional under the Headlee Amendment. Plaintiff did not seek monetary relief or a refund of service charges already paid. The trial court held that the service charge was a fee, not a tax. The Michigan Supreme court reversed, held that Lansing, Mich. Ordinance 925 was unconstitutional, and remanded. On remand the court held that the supreme court decision would be applied prospectively to prevent hardship and injustice. The court also found no authorization for plaintiff to be awarded damages on behalf of non-participants because he failed to comply with court rules and procedures to request damages. Further, the court declined to apply the multiplier to the attorney fee award because plaintiff made no showing that his ability to obtain competent counsel was contingent on the possibility of fee enhancement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the parents and next friends of a minor, challenged a judgment from the Kent County Circuit Court (Michigan), which granted a motion for summary disposition of the parents' claims in favor of defendants, a medical center and doctors. The parents alleged that the center and the doctors were either negligent in the treatment of the minor, or responsible for the negligent acts of their agents and employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The center and the doctors moved for summary disposition, pursuant to Mich. Ct. R. 2.116(C)(2), (8), claiming insufficient process issued and failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly granted summary disposition in favor of the center and the doctors. In pertinent part, the court first noted that it was undisputed that the parents did not comply with the provisions of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2912b, which required a 182-day notice before the filing of a medical malpractice lawsuit, and that the parents did not comply with the provisions of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2912d, which required an affidavit of merit to be filed with the complaint. In addition, the court rejected the parents' arguments that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 2912b violated Mich. Const. art. IV, &sect; 27, and that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2912b(1) violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. Instead, the court noted that it had already determined, in prior case law, that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 2912b did not violate equal protection or due process guarantees. Thus, summary disposition was an appropriate sanction for the parents' noncompliance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment granting summary disposition of the parents' claims in favor of the center and the doctors.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the testimony from the officers as to their observations of the dog fight in the yard and a veterinarian's testimony regarding the condition of the dogs provided some evidence that a dog fight had occurred. The court held that because there was some evidence, it was error to grant the motions to quash. The court held that the statute prohibiting attendance at an animal fight, Mich. Comp.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of second-degree murder, conspiring to intentionally discharge a firearm at a dwelling, intentional discharge of a firearm at a dwelling, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. Defendant contended, inter alia, that his convictions for second-degree murder and intentionally discharging a firearm at a dwelling violated the prohibition against double jeopardy by subjecting him to multiple punishments for the same act, i.e., killing the victim. Upon review, the court stated that the limited text of the second-degree murder statute, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750, was enacted to protect people from intentional killings. In contrast, the intentional discharge statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.234b, was designed to prevent a variety of harms. The punishments of the two offenses did not suggest that second-degree murder was merely an aggravated form of intentional discharge. Also, the wide gap in the punishments indicated a dissimilarity in the purpose of criminalizing these acts. Consequently, defendant's convictions did not constitute multiple punishments for the same crime under the Michigan Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which convicted defendant of second-degree murder and intentional discharge of a firearm at a dwelling.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 750.529, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, in violation of &sect; 750.227b.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction on the argument that the trial court erred in refusing to appoint an expert on eyewitness testimony. The court found the trial court had reason to conclude that eyewitness identification was not a matter that required expert testimony. Both victims of the crime positively identified defendant at trial. No showing was made by defense counsel that the particular facts of this case required an expert to undermine the reliability of the identifications. In addition, defense counsel offered no indication that the expert had information about the case that would not be otherwise obvious to the jury. Finally, defendant was not deprived of his right to cross-examine any of the identification witnesses. Consequently, the trial court did abuse its considerable discretion in refusing to appoint an expert under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 775.15.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to three counts of second-degree murder and one count of burning real property. Defendant filed an amended motion for relief from judgment in which he argued that his guilty pleas were illusory. Defendant alleged that a recently decided case established a retroactive change in the law, that the construction of the word &quot;arson&quot; in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.316 did not include the burning of other real property. The court determined that in deciding that case, the supreme court did not explicitly find that defendant's case was an unreasonable interpretation of the felony-murder statute at the time it was decided. The court declined to hold illusory defendant's plea to a lesser offense that was unquestionably supported by a sufficient factual basis because the relevant law regarding the charged greater offense was unsettled at the time of the plea hearing. The court concluded that defendant did not establish an abuse of prosecutorial discretion, which would have rendered the entry of defendant's guilty plea manifestly unjust, and did not advance a good cause for his failure to raise the issue in his prior appeal of right.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that defendant's actions were sufficient to create within the victims a reasonable fear of dangerous consequences in the event they did not comply with defendant's demand.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were insurance companies domiciled in California and licensed to do business in Michigan. As entities doing business in Michigan, they were subject to Michigan's taxes. They filed amended tax statements for two years requesting a refund, including in its calculation of Michigan burdens or special burdens amounts paid to different insurance programs. Their request was denied. Plaintiffs brought action. The lower court held that the statutes that taxed plaintiffs were unconstitutional. The lower court also held that the ninety-day statute of limitations contained in the statute was constitutional and barred plaintiff from receiving a refund. The court determined that the purpose of the amendments to the insurance code, which provided the method of calculating the tax and excluding from the definition of burden payments to third-party associations, was enacted to generate revenue at the expense of foreign insurers. The exclusion of third-party assessments in the calculation of burdens for retaliatory tax purposes was not rationally related to the stated goal of promoting the interstate business of domestic insurers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of assault with intent to murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. The appellate court affirmed. The trial court did not err by not instructing the jury on how to decide whether appellant had intent to commit murder. The prosecutor's reference to the social issue of gun-related violence against young African-American men in Detroit was improper but was not reversible error. Any impropriety in the prosecutor's question &quot;would you have been mad?&quot; made to the jury could have been cured on instruction. Nor was defense counsel ineffective since there was no reasonable probability that but for such a deficiency the outcome of the trial would have been different. The requirement of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227b (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.424(2)) that felony-firearm be punished by imposition of a determinate sentence was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it was reasonable to infer from the evidence that defendant was indeed carrying a gun, because evidence established that the gun was lodged in defendant's motorcycle in a location that made the weapon readily accessible. Therefore, the court affirmed defendant's convictions, but remanded the matter for resentencing because the trial court acted improperly in amending sua sponte the judgment of sentence to reflect that the sentences were to run consecutively.</SPAN></P>

Further, the trial court's findings were supported by sufficient evidence. Since the evidence of the breaking was consistent with defendant's stated intention to enter the home, the trial court was justified in finding that defendant intentionally broke into and entered the complainant's home.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged her conviction for keeping a house of ill fame and argued that &sect; 750.452 was unconstitutionally vague. The court found that &sect; 750.452, which prohibited the operation of a place resorted to for prostitution or lewdness was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided defendant with fair notice that her behavior was illegal. The court rejected defendants argument that &sect; 750.452 was inapplicable since the purpose of her acts was to produce pain rather than pleasure and that they therefore were not sexual. The court held that defendant's conduct constituted &quot;sexual contact&quot; because there was undisputedly intentional contact with intimate body parts and a reasonable person could construe the contact as being for sexual gratification. The court concluded that when defendant operated the sadomasochist establishment to perform acts for sexual gratification, she violated &sect; 750.452.</SPAN></P>

The only &quot;pretense&quot; was the implied promise that there was sufficient money in the checking account to cover the checks and that they would be paid. The court concluded that viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecutor, a rational trier of fact could not have found that the essential elements of the crime of false pretenses were proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence, however, was more than sufficient to sustain a conviction for the alternative lesser charge of three insufficient fund checks within 10 days under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.131a(2) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.326(1)(2)).

Prior to a race, representatives from the respondent commissioner's office searched a barn located on petitioner's property, turning up several unauthorized and illegal drugs. Petitioner's license was suspended. The lower court found that the search was unconstitutional, and thus it excluded the evidence obtained and reinstated petitioner's license. On appeal, the court found that a reasonable person would have believed that petitioner's consent to search the horses and their related tack included consent to search the barn and areas within it that might be able to hold the tack.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a traffic accident victim and his wife, sought review of an order of the Lapeer Circuit Court (Michigan), which granted defendant driver's motion for summary disposition in plaintiffs' third-party no-fault action for damages sustained in a rear-end collision. The circuit court held that a new amendment to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3135 (Act) required the victim to show that his injuries had caused serious impairment of body function.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the accident, but before the victim filed suit, the Michigan no-fault automobile insurance statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3101, et seq., was amended. After the amendment, subsection seven of the Act required that in order to recover non-economic damages for serious impairment of body function, a claimant must show objectively manifested impairment of an important body function that affected his general ability to lead a normal life. On appeal, the court held that it was not error to apply the amendment to the Act retroactively to the victim's suit because the amendment had been procedural in nature, and the Act had specifically stated that it would apply to actions filed on or after 120 days after its effective date. The court found that the victim had not shown any objective manifestation of his injuries, other than a shoulder separation diagnosed a year after the accident, or impairment of an important body function and had been able to maintain his normal lifestyle, including exercise activities. Therefore, the court concluded that it was not error to grant the driver's motion for summary disposition. The court noted that the victim had not had a vested right to a trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's order, which had granted the driver's motion for summary disposition of the third-party no-fault action filed by the victim and his wife.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff fireworks retailer challenged the judgment of the Ingham County Circuit Court (Michigan), which granted summary disposition in favor of defendant city in the retailer's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and malicious prosecution action. The trial court disposed of the retailer's claims on the grounds of governmental immunity and an earlier decision that found that the retailer's fireworks were illegal under Michigan's fireworks statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city seized and destroyer certain fireworks sold by the retailer. The retailer pled no contest to the criminal charges. The retailer then filed suit, alleging malicious prosecution and &sect; 1983 violation. The court affirmed the order that granted summary judgment in favor of the city. The court held that the fireworks were contraband per se and were therefore subject to immediate destruction. They were not legally possessed, and it therefore would have been improper to return them to the retailer. Because the fireworks were contraband per se, their seizure and immediate forfeiture was authorized by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 780.652. The court held that the prosecuting attorney in the underlying case was absolutely immune from a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim based on the initiating of a prosecution and presenting the state's case. The retailer failed to state a claim for malicious prosecution because it did not demonstrate that the prior criminal proceedings terminated in its favor; the retailer pled no contest to violating the fireworks statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court suppressed evidence seized from a hotel room because it found that the officers serving a search warrant did not sufficiently alert those inside the room and that they possibly acted improperly in using a key card to access the room. On review, the court reversed the order suppressing the evidence. In reaching its conclusion, the court relied on caselaw holding that officers serving a search warrant were not required to announce their presence when they believed that such an announcement could lead to the destruction of evidence. The court noted that the record established that officers believed that announcing their presence would lead to the disposal of the drugs on the property. Thus, the court held that the method by which the officers accessed the room was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimants appealed the decision of the Keweenaw Circuit Court (Michigan), which ruled that the claimants did not prove the existence of a prescriptive easement over defendant landowner's property, and that they were not entitled to invoke Michigan's private roads statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 229.1 et seq., to require defendant township supervisor to impanel a jury to determine whether roadway construction on the land was a necessity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants' asserted that they had an easement to use road on the landowners' property and sought to require the supervisor to impanel a jury to determine whether a road on the land was a necessity. The trial court ruled against the claimants. On appeal, the court affirmed the finding that there was no prescriptive easement, but remanded for a writ of mandamus compelling the supervisor to comply with the private roads act. The court ruled that evidence that the road was used by the public and that the claimants' use was not inconsistent with the landowners' rights indicated that the use was not open, notorious, and adverse, as required for a prescriptive easement. The court found that the presumption of a lost grant did not apply because the claimants did not assert that they had been granted an easement, but that their use of the road was continuous, adverse, open, and notorious. The court ruled that the trial court erred by failing to issue a writ of mandamus instructing the supervisor to impanel a jury on the claimants' application because he had a clear legal duty to begin proceedings to determine the necessity of the proposed road and had no discretion to do otherwise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that no prescriptive easement was established, reversed its ruling that the private roads statute did not apply, and remanded for issuance of a writ of mandamus compelling the township supervisor to impanel a jury to determine the necessity of opening a road on the landowners' property under the private roads act.</SPAN></P>
