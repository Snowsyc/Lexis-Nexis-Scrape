XIV, for failing to determine whether a certified judgment resulted from appellee's negligent driving.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee licensee executed a judgment note that contained a confession of judgment clause for an insurance company based on his involvement in a motor vehicle accident. Appellee's vehicle operator's license was suspended because of the judgment against appellee, pursuant to 75 P.S. &sect; 1413. In an action against appellant department of transportation, appellee sought judicial review of the license revocation. The lower court reversed the suspension, concluding that &sect; 1413 violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it mandated suspension without requiring evidence that the certified judgment resulted from appellee's negligent driving. Appellant challenged the ruling, claiming that a licensee would not execute a judgment note except to avoid an action for damages caused by his negligence. The court affirmed the lower court's ruling, holding that the constitution required appellant to have sufficient evidence to determine that a reasonable possibility existed that appellee's negligent driving caused his own liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant liquor control board employee was also a committeeman of his local ward and division.

Appellee state civil service commission removed appellant from his employment with the liquor control board because he had engaged in illegal political activity in violation of the act. The court affirmed the order of removal. The court found that appellant failed to show any bias on the part of appellee. The court also found that appellee carefully separated the various functions involved in its review of the matter. Therefore, appellant was afforded his full rights to a due process hearing. The court also found that appellee's decision was supported by substantial evidence and that the evidence amounted to more than a mere technical violation of the act. Appellant had a choice of holding his position or of exercising his constitutional rights that the position did not allow. He could not do both.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff municipalities appealed an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), dismissing their complaints, in which they sought to invalidate certain triennial tax assessment laws, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In cases involving an objection to the levying of taxes on the basis of a partial revaluation of property in one county, plaintiff municipalities sought judicial relief from the revaluation. Specifically, plaintiffs sought a decree declaring unconstitutional the provision of the Second Class County Assessment Act, 72 P.S. &sect; 5452.7, which empowered defendant Board of Property Assessment to adopt a system of triennial assessments by dividing the county into three districts. Plaintiffs contended that the legislative enactment contravened the uniformity requirement of Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The trial court dismissed the appeal, finding that it lacked equity jurisdiction over the matter because the plaintiffs had an adequate statutory remedy available to them. On appeal, the court affirmed. Plaintiffs could appeal the assessments to the Board of Property Assessment, Appeals and Review, then to the court of common pleas, and finally, to the Supreme or Superior court, under 72 P.S. &sect;&sect; 5425.11, 5425.12 and 72 P.S. &sect; 5020-518.1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant taxpayer sought review of an order from plaintiff Board of Finance and Revenue (Pennsylvania), which refused to grant defendant's petition for refund of sales tax. Defendant contended that its entitlement to a refund was based upon its exempt status with respect to the payment of sales tax by virtue of the Cooperative Agricultural Association Corporate Net Income Tax Act, 72 P.S. &sect; 3420-21 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, plaintiff Board of Finance and Revenue challenged defendant taxpayer's asserted grounds for a refund by contending that the Sales Tax Act, 72 P.S. &sect; 3403 et seq., repealed by implication the claimed exemption granted by the Agricultural Association Corporate Net Income Tax Act, 72 P.S. &sect; 3420-21 et seq. The court rejected plaintiff's argument and instead found that the legislature had not intended the general provisions of the Sales Tax Act to eliminate the very specific exemption provided for agricultural cooperatives, such as defendant, under 72 P.S. &sect; 3420-21 et seq. The court noted that without the requisite &quot;manifest&quot; intention to repeal, the court was without authority to interpret the Sales Tax Act's general provisions as repealing the exemption granted to defendant. The court, however, then found that defendant was entitled to claim a refund under 72 P.S. &sect; 3403-553(a) only for sales taxes paid over a three-year period. The court reversed, concluding that the five-year period under 72 P.S. &sect; 3403-553(d) was unavailable to defendant because no proceedings were pending at the time that the instant petition for a refund was filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the refusal to grant defendant taxpayer's petition for a refund of sales taxes, given that the general provisions of the Sales Tax Act did not repeal by implication the specific exemption granted to agricultural cooperatives, such as defendant. The refund, however, extended only to a period of three years prior to the filing of its petition where no proceedings were pending at the time of the petition's filing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant realty company challenged the order of the Board of Finance and Revenue (Pennsylvania), which included out-of-state assets in computing a franchise tax imposed on appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant realty company was a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of operations located in New York City. Appellant was also registered to do business in Pennsylvania under a certificate authorizing it to own, operate, and deal in real estate, and to hold and deal in securities. When the Board of Finance and Revenue (board) imposed a franchise tax on appellant, its formula included certain out-of-state assets, to which appellant objected. On appeal, the court ruled for appellant. The board erred when it based the franchise tax on certain New York activities that were unrelated to Pennsylvania operations. Those New York activities were entirely independent from appellant's real estate activity in Pennsylvania. Further, the board also erred in including certain marketable securities in the base for calculating the franchise tax. The court held that the disputed franchise tax should be confined to the value of the land and buildings located in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overturned the order of the Board of Finance and Revenue (board) in imposing a franchise tax on appellant realty company. The board incorrectly included assets of appellant located out-of-state and not involved in Pennsylvania operations.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellee had the authority under the Human Relations Act, 43 P.S. &sect; 955, to order busing to relieve de facto segregation in a school population. Appellants could be required to submit plans even though the costs incident to the plans might exceed their financial resources, because the financial details could be resolved later. Similarly, appellants were to submit complete plans and then appellee could determine if it had the power to order neighboring suburban districts to participate. However, the court remanded for further review that portion of appellee's order requiring appellants to develop an affirmative staff recruitment plan because there were no specific allegations of discrimination in hiring practices.</SPAN></P>

Appellee Public Utility Commission granted the request and appellant commercial carrier sought judicial review. The court ruled it could not substitute its independent judgment or resolve conflicting testimony. The court found substantial evidence of the public need for appellee's services. In considering appellee's violations, the court found the violations were conducted in good faith reliance that its predecessor had serviced the same area and that he has acted in the sincere belief that its certificate was based on nautical miles.

Pursuant to the ordinance, appellant farm owner applied for a license so that appellant sewage authority could continue to deposit sludge on the farm. Appellee denied the request. Appellants brought an action in mandamus to compel issuance of the license. The court below denied the requested relief. On appeal, the court found that deposit of sludge was a nonconforming use. As such, farm owner was required to register the nonconforming use within six months of the effective date of the zoning ordinance and he had failed to do so. In reversing the decision, the court held that the failure to register did not prevent the permit from being issued. The nonconforming use could only be lost by ceasing the nonconforming use for a period of one year, not by failing to register.

The trial court rejected appellants' argument that another variance permitting a gas station had been permitted in the past, writing that evidence of granting other variances was both irrelevant and inadmissible. It rejected the argument that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional in that it had the effect of totally prohibiting gas stations by limiting them to a zone where they were not economically feasible, writing that it could not find that the borough was unreasonable in its regulation of gas stations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A women's' organization filed a complaint with appellee Commission on Human Relations (commission) charging appellant newspaper with deliberate, constant violations of a city sexual discrimination ordinance because it listed ads for jobs based on sex, alleging a violation of Pittsburgh, Pa., Human Relations Ordinance &sect; 8(j). The commission found probable cause to file a complaint, and a hearing followed, which resulted in findings adverse to appellant. On appeal, the lower court found substantial evidence to support those findings. By granting a petition for supersedeas, pendente lite, the court held that the complaint was adequate and sufficiently specific. Appellant had notice and knowledge that it was aiding employers to unlawfully discriminate by placing job listings under arbitrarily segregated male and female columns. Thus, the court concluded that appellant was not denied due process of law, and the court affirmed the order, issuing an injunction ordering appellant to cease and desist, including all reference to sex in employment advertising column headings.</SPAN></P>

According to the court, it was undisputed that a zoning ordinance was presumed to be valid and constitutional and that the burden of proving otherwise was upon the person challenging the ordinance. The court held that before a zoning ordinance could be declared unconstitutional, the challenging party must prove that its provisions were clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare. The court stated that appellants failed to meet their burden in that they did not show the ordinance was arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety and general welfare.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant coal company was denied a drainage permit by appellee Sanitary Water Board (board). It appealed by supersedeas, questioning whether appellee could require it to treat water in its' mine from an underground pool formed by independent inactive mines when that water was polluted before entry into the mine, and upon removal, the level of pollution was not increased. The court agreed that appellee's holding contained two fatal flaws: it required appellant to treat drainage caused by whatever source, and it found that appellant had not demonstrated that discharge would not cause pollution. Since the discharge here did not cause pollution, it was unnecessary for appellant to affirmatively demonstrate that point. Therefore, appellee erred in finding appellant liable for all discharges, making the order an unreasonable, arbitrary and oppressive exercise of police power. Hence, the order refusing issuance of mine drainage permits was reversed, and the matter was remanded for issuance of the permit.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that appellant was not entitled to the tax paid, and appellee was entitled to the refund. Yet, he was not entitled to interest until the court below ordered the refund.

Defendants filed preliminary objections raising a jurisdictional question. The court issued a preliminary injunction and denied defendants' motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction. The court rejected defendants' proposition that the court must state in specific language that it had jurisdiction before considering the propriety of a preliminary injunction.

The court noted that appellant offered no evidence to contradict appellee's evidence that the regulation was reasonable nor any evidence supporting her argument that pregnancy was an illness. The court cited case law holding that a teacher who was incapacitated by virtue of pregnancy was not entitled to sick leave and could be required to resign. While affirming the dismissal as reasonable, the court did note the statements of the Secretary of Education encouraging conferences between boards that might produce some uniformity in discharge regulations based on maternity with due consideration for present day concepts such as equality of the sexes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed judgments in two cases that upheld the constitutionality of the provisions of appellee's zoning ordinances regulating junk yards.

The court held that provisions in the ordinance related to set-backs and fencing were not so vague and indefinite as to be incapable of reasonable application and were substantially related to traffic and fire safety. The court held that although a principal purpose of fencing requirements and prohibitions against stacking two or more vehicle or major parts was aesthetics, that was a permissible justification, and these requirements were also substantially related to safety. Finally, the court held that spacing requirements were necessary to allow fire and emergency equipment to maneuver within the junkyards.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the township had not acted in good faith, but had changed the zoning for the sole purpose of preventing appellant's legal use of their property, and was arbitrary and unreasonable.

The secretary subsequently suspended appellant's motor vehicle operating privileges for four months. The trial court affirmed appellant's suspension, and the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that &sect; 1002(b)(8) was not unconstitutional because there was nothing vague about the plain language of the statute that required signs to be posted &quot;not less than one-eight of a mile apart.&quot; The statute also did not authorize the unreasonable spacing of signs. Finally, the court held that the &quot;exact&quot; same violation did not have different penalties under other sections of the statute.

While the nonconforming use and economic hardship had been proved, the finding that a grant of the application would adversely affect the public interest was demonstrated on the record. Thus, while appellee demonstrated unnecessary hardship, it failed to demonstrate the second element necessary for a variance, that the variance would not be contrary to the public interest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee City of Pittsburgh issued notices of condemnation as to structures owned by appellants, property owners, acting pursuant to a city ordinance. Appellants sought a hearing in the trial court, pursuant to 53 P.S. &sect; 25094. The trial court ruled that appellee was within its constitutionally delegated police powers. On appeal, the court affirmed the order of the trial court, holding that the demolition ordinance, 1915 Pa. Laws 297, 53 P.S. &sect; 25081, was a proper and necessary exercise of the police power as long as there was factual evidence to support its application to a specific structure. The court further held that there was such evidence, because the expert witness, the building inspector, presented ample testimony, including photographs, of the conditions of the buildings in question and his knowledge of safety standards. Finally, the court held that the warrantless entry into the buildings by city building inspectors did not violate constitutional search and seizure protections, because no occupants were disturbed, no criminal penalties were contemplated, and there was no protected private interest counterbalancing the public need for safe buildings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's opinion, holding that appellee City of Pittsburgh's demolition orders regarding property of appellants, property owners, were within its constitutional police power, because there was factual evidence to support their application to specific structures, a finding of nuisance was supported by sufficient evidence, and proper administration of ordinances sanctioned the warrantless inspection of the buildings.</SPAN></P>

The court held that enforcement of the act did not constitute a taking of property without due process because appellant offered no evidence that the standards were unreasonable except that company could not meet them in the operation of its coke ovens. The court upheld the exclusion of governmental bodies from the act's penalty section because contempt proceedings for failure to abide by a court order were adequate enforcement. The court remanded the case, holding that the regulations were legally sufficient, but commission did not present sufficient evidence to support regulatory action because it was based solely on visual tests when instrumentation was available, but not used, for verification, and commission should have allowed evidence of economic factors to determine a compliance deadline.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the auditor general and the state treasurer for the commonwealth (Pennsylvania), filed a preliminary objection, in the nature of a demurrer, to the complaint in mandamus by plaintiff judge, brought on behalf of himself and his fellow judges of a municipal court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs served as judges of a municipal court, who submitted vouchers to the defendants, the state's auditor general and treasurer, requesting compensation at certain rates. Defendants declined the vouchers. Acts were later passed which fixed plaintiffs' compensation at the rates specified in the vouchers, but made the salary effective from July 1, 1969. Prior to the passage of that act, plaintiffs brought an action in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to direct defendants to pay the vouchers; that court denied the petition. Plaintiffs then filed a complaint in mandamus in the court, seeking to have defendants compelled to pay the salaries for the six-month period preceding the act's enactment. The court held that the appropriate forum in which plaintiffs' cause could be resolved in their favor was the forum originally selected by plaintiffs, the Supreme Court, as it would take nothing less than the supreme judicial power of the commonwealth to direct defendants to pay warrants for the salaries &quot;provided by law,&quot; which law was supplied by the Supreme Court and not the legislature. Defendants' preliminary objection was sustained, and judgment was entered for defendants.</SPAN></P>

The legislature was given wide latitude so far as concerned the classes into which articles could be arranged for purposes of taxation, and the court was forbidden to interfere unless a classification were illusory or clearly intended as an evasion of the constitution. The court found no testimony in the record indicating that the classifications were not reasonable. The court held that art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Annexation proceedings were commenced to annex appellant township's land into appellee borough. Appellant brought an appeal complaint, alleging that the annexation ordinance under 53 P.S. &sect; 46010 was illegal. Appellee brought a petition for a rule show cause why the appeal should not be quashed. Appellee claimed that appellant failed to enter security as required under the statute. The trial court made the rule show cause absolute and quashed the appeal. Appellant sought review, along with a petition for leave to file an appeal nunc pro tunc. Appellant claimed a hardship would result if the appeal was not allowed. Appellee claimed the motion to quash the appeal was untimely under 17 P.S. &sect;&sect; 211.101-211. The trial court granted appellee's motion and denied appellant's petition. The township failed to show a breakdown in the court's operations. The court found hardship alone was not a justification for the allowing of an appeal nunc pro tunc. Likewise, failure to receive notice by itself was not sufficient reason for allowing a nunc pro tunc appeal. It was appellant's burden to show fraud or that there was a breakdown in the lower court's operations in the mailing of appeal notices.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found in favor of appellee. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the amendatory ordinance was improper because it was passed for the purpose of thwarting appellant's use of its land for a permissible special exception purpose. The court noted that there was no other conceivable purpose for the amendment at that time because a complete revision of the zoning ordinance was already planned.

Defendant filed preliminary objections that the court lacked jurisdiction because of defendant's sovereign immunity from suit without its consent. Defendant also argued that the court was without jurisdiction because under &sect; 301(1) of the Act of August 10, 1951, 20 P.S. 2080.101 et seq., only the Orphans' Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of a county was empowered to enter a decree directing the payment of the funds to the person entitled. The court agreed and dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction because plaintiff was suing the commonwealth and thus was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.

The court disagreed and affirmed appellee's decision. The court found that under &sect; 404, no retiree was entitled to a lump sum payment of retirement benefits. The statute explicitly provided for lump sum payments of all benefits in other sections, but did not in &sect; 404. The cap placed upon a retiree's benefits was not unconstitutional as applied to appellant. In fact, the new &quot;cap&quot; actually resulted in a higher annual payment to appellant than he would have received under the prior limitation.

The court found that respondent offered no justifiable bases for the total city-wide prohibition on off-site signs. To the contrary, it erroneously alleged that this burden was upon appellant. The court held that, where there was a total exclusion, no matter how it was accomplished, the municipality must bring forward sufficient and valid reasons for the prohibition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant township sought review of a trial court's order that found its zoning ordinance to be an unconditional instance of spot zoning that discriminated against appellee landowner.

The court found that the ordinance in question did not discriminate against appellee's property because it did not have as its sole purpose an unjust discrimination directed toward appellee's particular piece of property. The court also did not find this case to be one of spot zoning. The court held that the ordinance must be viewed as having as one of its purposes the attainment of homogeneity and that such a purpose was a proper aim of the zoning process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent heirs challenged 72 Pa. Stat. &sect; 2302, insofar as it classified sons-in-law as collateral heirs, subject to a rate of tax higher than daughters-in-law, whom it classified as lineal heirs. The lower court found the statute unconstitutional. On review, the court dismissed the Commonwealth's exceptions. The court noted that the Supreme Court of the United States had interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment to prevent discrimination because of country of origin, alienage, illegitimacy, and sex. Furthermore, under Pennsylvania law, any taxation which drew a distinction as to rate of tax between men and women was ipso facto unconstitutional. The Equal Rights Amendment to the Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 28 provided that equality of rights under the law could not be denied or abridged in the Commonwealth due to the sex of the individual. Thus, the Pennsylvania Equal Rights Amendment rendered section 2 of the Inheritance Tax Act of 1919, 72 Pa. Stat. &sect; 2302, unconstitutional insofar as it classified sons-in-law as collaterals, while classifying daughters-in-law as lineals.</SPAN></P>

He argued that &sect; 13-1318 was unconstitutional as vague, over-broad and an invalid delegation of power to local school boards. The court affirmed the judgment. The statute in question gave the board of school directors a wide field of discretion. The standards set forth to guide them in decreeing suspension or expulsion were the words disobedience of misconduct. The constitutional guarantees of due process which required a hearing before expulsion amply protected a student's rights. Although the clarity of &sect; 13-1318 fell short of the high goad of precise and unquestionable definition desired, the mandatory conditional safeguards of due process created the necessary shield of protection from arbitrary or capricious enforcement of the quasi-penal statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving at 67 miles per hour in a 55-mile per hour zone. A summary conviction was entered in magistrate's court and the court affirmed the judgment. The court first held that the abolition of the writ of certiorari in summary proceedings did not violate defendant's Pa. Const. art. 5, &sect; 26. That provision specifically contemplated that the rules permitting writs of certiorari from the magistrate's court might be changed. Further, the writ of certiorari was merely a remedy for challenging procedural defects in proceedings and appeals de novo provided under Pa. R. Crim. P. 67 preserved all prior rights guaranteed by a writ of certiorari. Defendant was not subject to double jeopardy by invoking this review process. The court then held that alleged mechanical defects in defendant's speedometer were not acceptable as valid defenses to the speeding charges. Defendant was chargeable with the accuracy of his speedometer and any inaccuracy did not prevent the State from perfecting proper arrests for violating the speeding laws. Finally, the court ruled that the radar device used by the arresting officer was properly approved by the State.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the only distinction as between a mother and reputed father was the limitation of time in which a prosecution could be brought under the statute against the reputed father. This did not affect the substantive provisions of the remaining portions of the statute even if it was determined that the limitation of action portion of the statute was unconstitutional.

Also before the court was the students' motion for summary judgment on which the court had reserved its decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school complied a list of students names, such as those who smoked, and restricted their use of the restroom during certain limited times, unless given express permission under extraordinary circumstances. The students were suspended from school on two occasions for a period of three consecutive days each for violation of the restrictions. The court affirmed. The Board of Education had discretion under &sect; 5-510 of the Public School Code of 1949 (Pennsylvania) to adopt reasonable rules for the conduct of students, which included a ban on smoking, and it was reasonable for the Superintendent of Schools to permit the local principal to implement the Board's policy. The policy was well known to the student body. The rules were not unreasonable and students had free access to the nurse if needed. There was no violation of the students' Fourteenth Amendment rights. The students knew the rules, knew their names were on the list, and the Fourteenth Amendment did not permit them to exercise their rights by trampling upon the rights of others to enjoy clean restrooms unpolluted by smoke. Last, the list, kept by the principal, did not subject the students to any &quot;badge of disgrace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion for summary judgment was denied. The application for an injunction was denied. The students were granted 20 days to take exceptions and in default thereof the prothonotary was to enter a decree nisi upon the record as absolute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">About 25 young people, including defendant, had gathered in a park where they were drinking beer, yelling obscenities at passersby, and blocking traffic. After several individuals were arrested, defendant and a few of his companions gathered outside the police station where they were ordered to disperse. While his companions retreated, defendant continued to verbally abuse the officers as he backed away, at which point he was arrested. After the jury found defendant guilty of violating &sect; 5502, he filed motions for a new trial and arrest of judgment. The court denied the motions, noting that &sect; 5502 did not require three or more persons to be guilty of disorderly conduct. Rather, it required the participation of three or more persons in a course of disorderly conduct. Although defendant's companions had dispersed, the gravamen of &sect; 5502 was the failure to obey the police order to disperse. Further, &sect; 5502 was not vague because it was clear to any person of reasonable intelligence that he had not dispersed if he remained in a position that posed the threat and danger &sect; 5502 sought to prevent. Finally, defendant lacked standing to present his overbreadth challenge to &sect; 5502.</SPAN></P>

The court opined that it was a valid exercise of legislative power to vest in presiding judges discretionary power to order expenditure of money raised by taxation for payment of copies of transcripts that were furnished to private civil litigants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaints charged that defendants distributed a leaflet, which attacked the character of three local labor leaders. The leaflet branded one of its targets as psychotic and alleged that that all three were criminals. It was full of sexual references and suggested that all three were sexual deviates. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5504(a)(1) prohibited harassment by telephone. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5504(a)(2) prohibited repeated harassing communications, which were anonymous, at extremely inconvenient hours, or in offensively coarse language. The court rejected defendants' argument that the statute was unconstitutionally broad or an abridgement of their right to free speech. The statute was drafted in terms of the exception to the right to free speech, which existed for disruptive words. Nonetheless, the court found no violation of &sect; 5504(a)(2). First, the complaint alleged a single episode, and not a repeated course of conduct. Also, the communication was not anonymous or at inconvenient hours, and the thoughts were offensive, but the language was not &quot;offensively coarse.&quot; Finally, &sect; 5504(a)(2) applied to harassment of the victim and not offensive communication to others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A justice of the peace (Pennsylvania) acquitted defendant of the summary offense of killing a deer in excess of the season limit in violation of &sect; 502 of the Game Law of June 3, 1937, P.L. 1225, art. 5, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 34, &sect; 1311.502. The Commonwealth appealed. Defendant filed a motion to quash the appeal. The court heard the case de novo on its merits, subject to ruling on defendant's motion to quash.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The punishment for a first offense was a fine and denial of the right to hunt for a prescribed period. Imprisonment was provided for a second or subsequent offense under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 34, &sect; 1311.731. The court explained that defendant's acquittal was based on factual conclusions after consideration of the evidence at that trial. The court rejected the argument that Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 9 permitted the Commonwealth to appeal from summary acquittals. The court said that differences in applying the double jeopardy provisions in the Fifth Amendment of the federal constitution and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 were permissible only until the Fifth Amendment was made applicable to Pennsylvania through the Fourteenth Amendment. The court noted that the United States Supreme Court held that the double jeopardy protection prevented a government appeal from an acquittal. The court added that double jeopardy protection attached as long as the initial trial was criminal, regardless of how minor the offense. The court explained that the possibility of punishment by fine was sufficient and no potential imprisonment was necessary. The court ruled that a verdict of acquittal was final.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was admitted the owners maintained property in the borough and maintained an in-ground swimming pool on their property. The pool was not enclosed by any fence, but it was a considerable distance from the three public streets. In addition, there was a hedge line that ran along one of the boundaries of the property, but there were no gates in the openings of the hedgeline. The owners claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutional, but the court rejected that claim and dismissed the appeal. The court held that (1) the ordinance was not unconstitutional because it required pool owners to fence their pools but did not impose the same requirements on natural lakes or ponds because that classification was proper under statutory law; (2) the ordinance was not ambiguous as to the permit-issuing section where there was ample information as to what was required of pool owners; and (3) the requirement was not unreasonable or arbitrary as to the owners where the pool was still accessible by trespassers and created both an attraction and danger to any infant trespassers.</SPAN></P>

Th residents appealed, claiming that the Board's interpretation of &quot;family&quot; constituted an abuse of discretion and that the interpretation was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the Board's decision. The court examined the words of the ordinance and prior case law interpreting similar ordinances and held that the Board did not abuse its discretion in finding that the six unrelated residents did not constitute a family unit. The court held that the interpretation was not unreasonable because the ordinance specifically mentioned the types of bonds required, and although it mentioned &quot;other&quot; bonds, it was to be interpreted as similar to the previous bonds mentioned.

P. 101(3), which stated that in misdemeanor cases, criminal proceedings could be instituted by warrantless arrest only when committed in the arresting officer's presence. In denying the motion, the court held that pursuant to Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 10(c), the supreme court had the power to prescribe general rules governing practice and procedure if such rules were consistent with the Constitution and neither abridged, enlarged, nor modified the substantive rights of any litigant. The court held that &sect; 1204(a) of the Vehicle Code was a statutory modification of the common law affecting substantive rights in limited and specific misdemeanor cases. Because &sect; 1204(a) legally modify substantive rights, the court held that it was not suspended or rendered inoperative by Pa. R. Civ. P. 101(3).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of drunk driving, defendant moved for consideration under the Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition Program (ARD).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of drunk driving, defendant's attorney, believing his client worthy of ARD, asked the district attorney to present the case to the judge for consideration. When the district attorney refused, defendant moved for ARD, claiming that ARD's application in the county violated equal protection because: (1) the district attorney uniformly excluded drunk driving cases from ARD; and (2) other counties included drunk driving in ARD. In denying the motion, the court held that the Fourteenth Amendment permitted classifications founded upon reason and logic. Because drunk driving was both serious and unique, the court held that there was a rational basis and a compelling State interest to place drunk driving in a status separately from other crimes to which ARD was applied. The court also held that probation, as parole, was a matter of mercy rather than a matter of right and that acceptance into ARD was not a fundamental constitutional right. Finally, the court held that inequality of treatment was not inherently a violation of equal protection where the law allowed a fair election between forms of treatment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police pursued a speeding vehicle and the driver fled the scene. The officers were unable to identify defendant as the driver. A registration check revealed that the vehicle was registered to defendant and his wife. At the invitation of the police, defendant went to the station and admitted that he was the driver. He was charged with the offenses of operating while under suspension, turning out lights to avoid identification, and reckless driving. He appeared before the court and decision was reserved to determine a legal question regarding the failure of the Commonwealth to identify him as the driver. Upon review, the court determined that he was guilty and ordered him to appear for sentencing. The court stated that the corpus delicti of driving while under suspension was made out. The court found that independent evidence, the registration plate, was established that defendant was the owner of the vehicle that the police pursued. The court stated that although there was co-ownership, the description of the driver as a male eliminated the wife co-owner. The court concluded that the Commonwealth met the requirements of the charges independently of defendant's admission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff resident filed a class action suit in equity that sought to void an &quot;occupation&quot; tax imposed by defendant school district and to preclude enforcement of the tax by defendant taxing authorities. The suit also attacked a provision contained in three tax resolutions enacted by the school district that imposed liability on a husband for occupation and per capita taxes levied against his wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident was subject to payment of the occupation tax. He lived with his wife, who was solely dependent upon him for support. Pursuant to &sect; 2 of the Local Tax Enabling Act, 1965 Pa. Laws 1257, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 6902, the school district imposed two &quot;per capita&quot; taxes on each &quot;person&quot; and the &quot;occupation&quot; tax of 18 percent (180 mills) on the value of all &quot;occupations.&quot; The resident argued that the occupation tax was illegal because it exceeded the $ 10 limitation for such taxes as outlined under &sect; 8 of the Act, Pa Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 6908. The court disagreed, holding that the school district's &quot;occupation&quot; tax qualified as such and was not affected by the provisions of &sect; 8 of the Act. Also, there was no prohibition against assessing all occupations at the same value. However, the provisions for the collection from a husband of taxes imposed on his wife, as contained in &sect;19 of the Local Tax Enabling Act, 1965 Pa. Laws 1257, amended by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 6919, and Article 6, &sect; 679 of the School Code of Pennsylvania, 1949 Pa. Laws 30, amended by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 6-679, violated the Equal Rights Amendment of the Pennsylvania Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were allowed to impose and collect the school district's occupation tax on the basis of a uniform occupational assessment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The previous order required the husband to pay $ 120 per week for the joint support for the wife and one child. The husband alleged that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4733 was unconstitutionally discriminatory against males and that the wife had no right to support. The court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 4733, and held that the wife was entitled to support. The court held, however, that the wife was also required to support the child for whom the husband had custody. The previous support order did not specify the amount of the wife's support and the amount of the child's support. The court found that there was a significant change in circumstances since the last order of support. The husband's expenses had increased significantly and the wife's income had increased significantly. The court ordered the husband to pay $ 25 per week for the wife and $ 10 for the minor child in the wife's custody. The order was retroactive. The court ordered a recomputation of the previously established arrearages to reflect the reduction in support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the previous court orders and ordered a computation of the accumulated arrearages based upon the new order. The court dismissed the husband's remaining prayers for relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner entered a plea of guilty to a charge of armed robbery. His sentence was to pay the costs, make restitution to the victim, and undergo imprisonment for not less than two and one-half years nor more than five years. A female co-defendant, charged with the same offense, also entered a guilty plea and was sentenced to make restitution and be committed for not more than 18 months. Petitioner brought an application for post-conviction relief. He contended that because he received a more severe sentence than the sentence imposed upon his female co-defendant, he was denied equal protection of the law in violation of U. S. Const. amend. XIV. According to petitioner's theory, unless he and his female co-defendant received the same sentence as to duration, place of confinement, accommodations, and parole rights, his constitutional due process rights were violated and his sentence was discriminatory because of sex and denied him equal justice. The court held that equal justice under the law did not mean exact equality of sentence.

V, &sect; 511, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 5-511. He also argued that the policy was unconstitutionally vague and that its enforcement denied him equal protection of the law. The court noted that the Public School Code gave the school district a broad mandate to adopt and enforce reasonable rules regarding student conduct. Also, the testimony of two teachers was sufficient to support the finding that the student had been drinking. The court also found that the bias of a school board member as to her point of view about issues of law was not grounds for disqualification.

Subsequently, the property owners were notified that a mobile home was not a permitted structure in an agricultural zone; consequently, their building permit was revoked. Thereafter, the property owners filed an application to the board seeking a ruling that the structure located upon the property was, in fact, a single-family dwelling within the meaning of the ordinance. In the alternative, property owners asked for a variance permitting them to use the mobile home as a single-family dwelling. After hearing and a decision by the board adverse to property owners' position, the property owners appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners appealed to the Board for the purpose of reducing their assessments. After hearings, the assessments were lowered. The owners then sought further reduction of the assessments and specifically challenged a lack of uniformity in assessments between their condominium building and similar apartment buildings. The court granted the relief prayed for by the owners. The court held that the uniformity standard of taxation took precedence over the fair market value standard and framed the issue as whether apartment type condominia were similar property or the same class of subjects as apartment buildings for property tax purposes. The Board contended that the fact that condominiums were owned and apartments were rented was enough of a difference to make a condominium dissimilar from an apartment building. The court held that this argument was irrelevant upon consideration of condominia and apartment buildings for assessment purposes. The court held further that the dissimilarity in income tax treatment of the owners of condominiums and renters of apartments was also irrelevant; this dissimilarity rested not with the property but with the situation of the individuals involved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the appeals and granted the relief prayed for by the owners.

The wife, a registered nurse, testified that she wanted the patient to receive the transfusion. She also testified that the patient's father, who did not arrive at court until after the hearing was over, also wanted the transfusion. The court ordered the transfusion to take place. It stated that until the United States Supreme Court ruled on the issue, the better rule concerning the right to administer a transfusion had been set forth by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit, which had ordered a transfusion in the case of a mother who had refused it on religious grounds. The court added that the right to practice religion freely did not include the right to diminish the respect for life which was the basis of all society.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer, a homebuilder, sought review of interim assessments made by a county assessment board upon residential homes in view of the provisions of the Act of July 29, 1970, P. L. 643, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72 &sect; 5453.203. If the assessments were not legal and proper under Pennsylvania law, it was the position of appellee, the Commissioners of Cambria County, that the law was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer received interim tax assessments on properties that he was constructing or had constructed and sold. Three of the properties were single residences that he built on a speculation basis and sold at or after completion. One property was only a foundation and was assessed as a commercial building. He challenged the assessments, claiming that they were barred because of &sect; 5453.203, which gave an exemption to construction for residential purposes. The court agreed and struck the assessments. Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2(b)(iv) (amend. 1968) provided that the legislature could make special tax provisions on any increase in value of real estate resulting from residential construction. The Act of July 29, 1970, P. L. 643, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72 &sect; 5453.203, the enabling legislation, classified new construction of a home as a separate class that was exempt from taxation. Thus, &sect; 5453.203 was constitutional but the assessments were not. The Commonwealth's policy was to exempt any dwellings built for residence purposes from assessment until occupied or sold to a bona fide purchaser. Home building for residential purposes was free of taxation until certain conditions were met.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court struck the assessments and ordered the commissioners to apply the provisions of the law.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 75, &sect; 1413.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the owner's vehicle was being driven by her son without her permission, it struck the rear of another car. The claimant named the owner as a defendant in proceedings before a district justice. The owner agreed to pay the claimant the sum of $ 1,000 at the rate of $ 25 a week. When she failed to make payments, judgment was entered against her and sent to the Department. Based only upon the confessed judgment, the license and registration of the owner were suspended. She appealed, arguing that, under the circumstances of her case, the act of the Department's Secretary was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held, after reviewing the contents of the Pennsylvania financial responsibility statute, that &sect; 1413 had as its purpose, if it was to have any valid purpose, the removal from the highway of negligent drivers who caused injury with impunity. Because &sect; 1413 was invoked by determining fault or liability for negligent driving by confessed judgment, the constitutional right to due process was violated. The owner had neither direct nor vicarious responsibility for the occurrence of the accident.</SPAN></P>

The court found that, although the rule was that police officers had to have probable cause to stop single vehicles to determine whether the vehicle was being operated in compliance with the Vehicle Code (Pennsylvania), the rule was inapplicable to systematic stops or roadblocks, such as the roadblock in defendant's case.

The court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally broad and vague insofar as it applied to one charged with obstructing a public sidewalk so as to interfere with free passage of traffic thereon. That particular offense was clearly and sufficiently defined by the ordinance. The court suggested that the various borough councils and their solicitors might be well advised to examine carefully, and to amend, if necessary, all ordinances relating to loitering in order to make certain that the offense was clearly spelled out and defined. The court held that Ford City, Pa., Ordinance No. 487, &sect; 1, insofar as it related to loitering by obstructing traffic, was not unconstitutional by reason of vagueness or by reason of being overbroad. The court held that defendant's second arrest under ordinance no. 487 was also proper and that his conviction for violation thereof was not constitutionally defective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved a couple's wish to lease one acre of their 35-acre farm to the mobile home owner, who was their daughter, and upon which parcel of land the owner intended to place her mobile home.

The township's zoning officer, under the ordinance, refused to grant a permit, and the zoning hearing board denied the appeal from that decision. On the owner's appeal, the court reviewed the ordinance and held that its provisions with respect to excluding the placing of a solo, single-family dwelling &quot;mobile&quot; home which, in fact, had been &quot;immobilized&quot; in the &quot;A Agricultural District&quot; where residences are permitted, was invalid by reason of being arbitrary and an unnecessary and unreasonable intermeddling with the private ownership of property. The court further held that such provisions were unconstitutional as being in violation of U.S. Const. amends. V and XVI and in violation of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and art.

R. Crim. P. 319(a), a trial judge could not accept a guilty plea unless he determined, after inquiry, that the plea was voluntarily and understandingly given. The court held that by testifying to his own conduct, the offender created the necessary factual basis to support the charge. Thus, the offender could not plead ignorance. Moreover, the court found that the offender's admission that he pleaded guilty expecting a lighter sentence was the more correct position. The offender also alleged that he was denied competent counsel when he was advised to plead guilty. The court found that counsel's advice was competent because the record supported the offender's guilt. In any event, if the offender's trial counsel had misinformed him of the meaning of the crime, it was harmless error because the trial court had the duty to assess the offender's understanding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver sustained injuries when his motorcycle struck an alleged defect on a state highway. The construction company was the general contractor engaged by the Commonwealth to construct the highway and the supply company provided the concrete used in the construction of the highway. The complaint, filed in December 1973, alleged that the defect, which caused the accident, resulted from various acts of negligence on the part of defendants in mixing the concrete and constructing the highway. The complaint claimed that the highway was completed in June 1961. Defendants filed answers to the complaint wherein they pleaded that they had no knowledge as to when the construction of the highway was completed. Defendants filed new matter that alleged that the driver's action against them was barred by the Act of December 22, 1965, P. L. 1183, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 65.1. The court held that because it was not known specifically when the construction of the highway was completed, it was not known if &sect; 1 of the Act could have been employed to bar the driver's action or whether &sect; 2 of the Act would have served to save the driver's action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff businesses commenced an action in equity seeking to have declared null and void an amusement tax passed by defendant school district. The businesses also sought to restrain the collection of any taxes thereunder in the interim. The businesses contended that the basis for the relief sought was that the tax resolution was unconstitutional and procedurally defective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district's tax resolution was adopted at meeting in which the notice stated that the meeting's sole purpose was &quot;to approve budget.&quot; The businesses instituted an adjudication in equity to declare the resolution void and to enjoin the collection of taxes, and the court determined that it had equity jurisdiction. The resolution's appeal clause did not give individuals in the businesses' class an adequate remedy because they did not represent interests totaling 25 percent of the valuation of the real estate in the school district. In addition, equity had jurisdiction where the controversy involved a constitutional challenge. On the merits, the court determined that the school district failed to provide the required public notice of its intent to pass a tax resolution. The notice failed to set forth the substantial nature of the tax by setting out the resolution's essential elements. Unless the statutory notice requirement was complied with, there was a lack of power to pass the resolution because the statutory was mandatory and in the nature of a condition precedent. Therefore, the court concluded that the amusement tax resolution was void and of no effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared the school district's amusement tax resolution void and of no effect and enjoined and restrained the school district from collecting any amusement taxes under the resolution, with the court's decree to become final if no exceptions were filed within 20 days.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to &sect; 1 of the Act of June 11, 1913, P.L. 468, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 48, &sect; 133, the court was given the power to enforce such orders and judgments by issuing its writ of execution to compel a sheriff's sale and satisfaction of such order or judgment. However, under &sect; 2 of the Act of 1923, P.L. 446, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 48, &sect; 138, the wife was entitled out of the proceeds of such a sale to the sum of money as representative of her share in the property, based on the proportionate part of the original purchase money furnished by her. The husband contended that the inconsistency in the statutes prevented the wife from being granted the relief requested. The court found that the presumption was against implied repeals. The court held that both acts could have stood together if the Act of 1913 applied to tenancies by the entireties created prior to the effective date of such act and if the Act of 1923 applied to tenancies by the entireties created after the effective date of such act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In considering the petition, the court noted that the initial question was whether it possessed the requisite jurisdiction to consider the issues raised and to grant appropriate relief if warranted. The court decided that it lacked such jurisdiction and that the appropriate jurisdiction to hear and dispose of these issues was that of the sending state. The court noted that the receiving state could never have exercised jurisdiction until the dominant or sending state had first made a jurisdictional decision (to deliver the accused to a requesting and potential receiving state.) Thus, all of the considerations pertinent to such a temporary release of custody should have been taken in that jurisdiction where the first and principal act temporarily releasing jurisdiction would have first occurred. All of the issues raised by defendant could have been appropriately and completely tested in the jurisdiction of the sending state. That jurisdiction was obviously paramount to the jurisdiction of the receiving state and official action must have occurred in the sending state's jurisdiction as a condition precedent to the exercise of any jurisdiction whatsoever by the receiving state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stipulated evidence was that defendant was lawfully confronted on the street by a policeman and dropped 50 bags of proved heroin in plain view. Defendant had on him no apparatus for personal drug use nor had he been observed in confrontation with other persons prior to arrest. Defendant argued that the Commonwealth could not prove its case without aid of an evidentiary presumption and that to presume possession with intent to deliver would be unconstitutional. The Commonwealth replied that it merely invoked the ordinary process of evidentiary inference. It further claimed that, permitted that inference, it carried its burden of proof on the issue. In finding defendant not guilty of the crime charged, the court held that to place power in the hands of judges or juries to invent criminal presumptions, or even to apply them without explicit, rational guidelines, patently was to invite chaos. The Pennsylvania Legislature never sought fit to legislate an appropriate presumption on the subject, and the court would not act in the absence of such legislation. Absent any other evidence, the evidence against defendant was constitutionally insufficient.</SPAN></P>

Defendant brought pretrial motions before the court.

The court overruled defendant's motion to suppress evidence because the court found that the search of defendant's person, which revealed a firearm, was warranted and justified after defendant was placed under arrest. The court overruled defendant's motion to dismiss, which defendant argues on the ground that the statute creating the offense with which he was charged, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6102, was unconstitutional because it imposed upon the defendant the burden of proving his innocence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents of the township sought a credit, or a refund, against taxes paid to the township in the amount of taxes paid to the State of New Jersey. The claim was based on the Local Tax Enabling Act, which provided for a tax credit under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 6914. The township conceded that the statutory provision required that residents of the township receive a credit or deduction, in the amount of a tax on income paid to New Jersey, against the township earned income tax. However, the township argued that the New Jersey tax was actually a tax on transportation. The court found, however, that the tax was an income tax based upon its purpose as demonstrated from the language of the Act. The variation in tax rate that resulted from allowing the New Jersey tax to be applied as a credit against the Pennsylvania personal income tax and the township personal income tax did not violate the uniformity clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution because the difference in rates was slight and the higher rates applied to broader privileges. The residents, therefore, were entitled to the credit they sought based upon the pleadings.</SPAN></P>

Laws 382, &sect; 60, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 1445, as amended 1972 Pa. Laws 1068, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5513.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth brought a forfeiture action against the claimant to forfeit property that the Commonwealth alleged was outlaw property pursuant to the Act. The claimant objected to the forfeiture on the grounds that there was no evidence that the devices in question were actually used for gambling purposes and that the Act was unconstitutional in that it deprived the claimant of his property without due process of law. The claimant maintained that there had to be proof of gambling before the machines could be declared illegal under the Act, which established as a category of outlaw property, the mere possession of which constituted a crime, any device or machine used and employed for the purpose of unlawful gaming. The court concluded that machines such as pinball and console machines could not have any lawful purpose and were gambling devices per se. Thus, the Commonwealth could seize the property without first demonstrating by direct affirmative evidence that the machines were used for unlawful gaming purposes. In addition, the court held that a seizure of outlawed property that was based upon probable cause was not a denial of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The condemnee owned a business located on the property at issue as well as an undivided one-seventh interest in the property. The condemnee and the property's other owners began leasing the property from the school district in March 1970. The condemnee was awarded business dislocation damages; he moved his personal property in December 1971. He sought further relief under &sect; 8 of the Act of December 29, 1971, P. L. 635 (No. 169), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 1-606A, which amended the Eminent Domain Code, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 1-101 et seq. The court held that the amendatory legislation entitled anyone displaced under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 1-201(8) on or after January 2, 1971, to the greater of any item of special damages for displacement as provided in the amended law or prior law without regard to any final disposition already made of a claim for special damages for displacement. There was no merit to the condemnor's argument that the retroactivity of the amendatory legislation was unconstitutional. The date that the condemnee moved, not the date that the lease took effect, was the date of displacement for purposes of the amendatory legislation.</SPAN></P>

The commissioners agreed, but the controller claimed that the new provision of the Constitution eliminated the officers' ability to retain the fees. The court agreed with the commissioners and held as follows: (1) under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 27, fees which incumbent officeholders received for services performed as county officers could not be decreased during their term of office; (2) in order for Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 4, para. 3 and the enabling legislation found in Act No. 113 of 1971 to be Constitutional, the provisions of that article were applicable only to those officeholders elected or appointed after the effective date of the legislation; (3) Act No. 113 of 1971, being enabling legislation, was inoperable as to these officeholders; and (4) as agents of the Commonwealth, they were entitled to receive fees and commissions paid by it for the years 1972 and 1973.</SPAN></P>

The employee replied that such action was without legal consequence because he clearly indicated his desire to continue his employment and the use of the proceeds of his pension checks was necessary for him to maintain and support his family. The court concluded that (1) the employee's actions did not constitute voluntary retirement in these circumstances; (2) the present ordinance permitting termination of employment as a policeman on grounds not specified within the civil service statutes, and which were not uniform, was violative of such statutes and was invalid; and (3) the employee was involuntarily retired under the pension ordinance solely and without regard to the Borough Code.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant, a Puerto Rican, was arrested on a murder and rape charge, he petitioned to quash the grand jury array on the grounds that the selection process was unconstitutional and systematically excluded persons of Spanish heritage. The court denied defendant's motion, holding that initial jury selection process properly allowed exclusion from jury duty based on the five criteria set forth in the Act of April 8, 1862, P.L. 325, &sect; 1, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 1102. In addition, the granting of an excuse from jury duty was not in and of itself unlawful, and the exemptions from jury duty set for in the Act of March 31, 1870, P.L. 732, &sect; 1, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 1247, were valid. Although defendant's equal protection rights contemplated use of a jury that represented a fair cross-section of the community, he had no right to demand that members of his race be in the jury. Defendant failed to establish an equal protection challenge because there was no substantial disparity in persons of Spanish heritage on the grand jury, and any disparity had no nexus with any discretionary exclusion of such persons. Voter registration lists were an appropriate pool from which to draw jurors.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the court determined that its only function was to approve or disapprove a location. The court ruled that the plant was not, per se, harmful to the community and would not constitute a nuisance. The court concluded that a line of trees as well as natural and artificial barriers formed some obstacle to the incinerator having a detrimental effect on the neighboring properties. The court noted that the fear of an incinerator had no basis in fact, that the idea of esthetics was not offended, that there was no showing of a decline in value, and that the inconvenience of an increase in traffic was not necessarily detrimental to the neighborhood.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action by petitioners, the Commissioners of Adams County, Pennsylvania, under the provisions of the Act of August 9, 1955, P.L. 323, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 2315(b), the court considered whether the Adams County, Pennsylvania, courthouse could have been relocated from the Borough of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to a new site in Cumberland Township, Pennsylvania. Objector citizens also appeared in the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioners filed a petition in which they asked the court to approve the plans for the construction of a new county courthouse. Prior to the court-ordered hearing on the matter, the citizens filed objections to the petition. At the hearing, the citizens argued that the Commissioners failure to provide detailed construction plans was fatally defective to the proceeding. The court agreed, but heard testimony on the question of whether the courthouse could have been relocated beyond the boundaries of the Borough of Gettysburg, the county seat of Adams County. The citizens argued that &sect; 405 of the County Code of August 9, 1955, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 405, required that county buildings be situated &quot;at&quot; the county seat. The Commissioners argued that the word &quot;at&quot; meant &quot;near,&quot; rather than &quot;within.&quot; Upon consideration, the court dismissed the petition. The court found that the County Code was intended to insure that essential county government services would have been carried on in the seat of county government and that the county courthouse must have been located within the geographical boundaries of the county seat.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church argued that the Council's refusal of its application to demolish the &quot;Victorian Italian villa&quot; that was situated on its property constituted an unlawful taking without just compensation in violation of art. I, &sect; 10 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The church also argued that the Board failed to make findings regarding the effect of the proposed change on the historical nature of the area, as required under the demolition statute and an applicable City ordinance that established the historical district in which the property was located. On review, the court held that the matter should be remanded to the Council for return to the Board for the taking of such testimony as would enable the Board to make the findings that were required under the demolition statute and the ordinance. The court adopted the test used by New York courts to determine whether an interference with the use of property could be an unconstitutional taking and concluded that the denial of the church's request without the requisite findings constituted a taking of its property within the meaning of art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted by a grand jury for an alleged violation of the Pennsylvania obscenity statute, Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 892, (no. 269), &sect; 1, 18 Pa. Stat. &sect; 4524(a). Defendants entered pleas of not guilty to the indictment and elected to be tried by the court without a jury. At the conclusion of the Commonwealth's case, defendants demurred to the evidence. The demurrers were before the court for resolution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an effort to sustain its burden to prove the guilt of defendants beyond a reasonable doubt, the Commonwealth produced evidence that on a certain date the first defendant was in operation of an adult book store, which was owned by the second defendant; that on the said date a Pennsylvania State Police officer went to the store and there purchased from the first defendant four paper-backed books, resembling magazines. The Commonwealth proceeded on two theories: First, the evidence of the books themselves, and, secondly, the testimony of two expert witnesses to establish the nature of the exhibits as an appeal to prurient interest and to prove violation of the contemporary community standards of the county and immediate environs. The court overruled defendants' demurrers, holding that the obscenity statute did not endanger the innocent, but was a calculated effort to proscribe commercial activity in the obscene, the exact activity of which defendants were charged. The court also held that the obscenity statute and its definition of what was &quot;obscene&quot; was sufficiently constitutionally specific so as to forewarn defendants against engaging in the conduct of which they were accused.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners sought to develop the land at issue as a retirement facility. The proposed use was not permitted in the district under the controlling ordinance. The property owners' proposed amendment purported to change the district to permit the retirement facility. The property owners alleged that the challenged ordinance failed to provide for institutional uses providing services required by retired and elderly persons and that it failed to provide for a range of residential uses corresponding to the housing requirements of the area. The Board did not find that the ordinance was constitutionally or legally defective. On appeal, the court noted that the responsibility of zoning falls upon the governing body of the municipality involved and not on the courts. The court determined that there was a presumption in favor of the validity of a municipal ordinance and that there was a heavy burden upon those who seek to overturn such ordinance. Accordingly, the court upheld the Board's decision. The court found that the ordinance did not permit the development; the proposed classification was not a permissible distinction; and, the property owners had not carried their burden.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 5453.101 et seq., the General County Assessment Law of May 22, 1933, P.L. 853, &sect; 1 et seq., 72 Pa.

Defendants contended equity lacked jurisdiction because plaintiffs had an adequate statutory remedy at law, and the complaint failed to raise a substantial constitutional question. The court concluded that variances in procedure of the machinery of assessment did not raise a constitutional question under the uniformity clause as would the contention the legislature lacked power to prescribe assessment procedures.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company and the department were both non-profit corporations that provided firefighting services to the township. The company was originally the only such organization, but a group of volunteers left the company following a dispute and organized the department. When attempts to settle on-going disputes were unsuccessful, the township passed Palmer Township, Pa., Ordinance 117 (Jan. 25, 1972) and notified the company that it would be permitted to answer alarms only at the request of the township's fire officials. The court denied and dismissed the company's complaint. Among other things, the court rejected the assertion that the township lacked authority to promulgate the ordinance. Noting that the township contributed equipment and supplies to the company and provided workmen's compensation insurance for all volunteer firefighters, the court found that 1963 P.L. 103, amended by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 65704 permitted the township to ordain rules and regulations for the government of fire companies. Accordingly, the court concluded that the township's financial contribution to the company was sufficient to authorize the township's action in passing the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The traveler filed a class action, and alleged that because of their monopoly, the companies and the restaurant had been charging excessive prices. The restaurant and the companies filed preliminary objections to the complaint. The court struck the punitive damage claims and otherwise dismissed the objections. Because providing restaurants and gas stations on the turnpike was for the benefit of travelers, the travelers were third party beneficiaries and had standing to complain of a breach of the contract. Because individual actions were impractical, the traveler was a proper class representative, the complaints of the class were similar, and the class was manageable, the action was suited to be a class action. The complaint stated the cause of action with sufficient particularity but did not provide facts sufficient to support the punitive damage claims. Defendants were properly joined.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, prosecutrix filed an answer to the rule. She also filed a petition to vacate the order. After hearing, the court vacated the order and granted leave to the prosecutrix to make answer. Defendant contended that because the order to dismiss was absolute, the court erred in vacating it. The petition of prosecutrix pointed out that the rule was never served upon her. Prosecutrix filed an answer to the rule before the expiration of the 20 days from her first awareness, but two days after the granting of the final order. The court held that because the rule was never properly served, the court properly entertained the petition to vacate the order. Defendant further contended that the law on failure to support a child born out of wedlock and for the support of bastards was unconstitutional. Defendant submitted a brief filed by the Commonwealth's Attorney General, which stated that the acts violated the Pennsylvania Constitution. However, the court noted that the act covered by the Attorney General's brief was that of fornication and bastardy and not failure to support a bastard child.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that it was no longer sufficient for the indictment to charge the offense of receiving stolen goods in the language of the statute, and that indictments charging the offense of receiving stolen goods must set out evidence showing a basis for such knowledge or a reasonable cause to know.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the illegitimate child, who had been acknowledged by the father in a paternity suit as his child, was entitled to the benefits of a child under the City of Philadelphia, Pa., Retirement System Ordinance &sect; 209.2. The mother contended that benefits under the pension system could only be paid to legitimate children. The court did not agree with her interpretation. The United States Supreme Court had set forth the test for evaluating the validity of statutory classifications under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which required that the classification bear some rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose. When the classification approached sensitive and fundamental personal rights, the court exercised strict scrutiny. Denying an illegitimate child pensions benefits was not going to cause persons to shun illicit relations. Furthermore, it was unjust to impose disabilities on the child for the wrongdoing of the parents. Because the child had been adjudged the son of the deceased officer, the specter of paternity problems did not exist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court enjoined the City from paying funds to any heirs other than to the guardian for the minor child and ordered that the child receive a share equal to the share of a child as provided in the City of Philadelphia Retirement System Ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted in the Philadelphia Municipal Court (Pennsylvania) for violating 1939 Pa. Laws 872, which pertained to the exhibition of an obscene motion picture. Defendant filed a timely appeal for a trial de novo and filed motions to suppress the evidence and to quash the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first had to determine whether it was empowered to rehear a pretrial motion previously ruled upon by a common pleas judge sitting in the capacity and jurisdiction of a municipal court judge. The court held that the mere fact that the common pleas judge was assigned to municipal court did not raise the case itself to the common pleas level. The common pleas judge had acted in the capacity of a municipal court judge. The concept of a trial de novo encompassed the pretrial suppression aspects of a case. As to the suppression motion, the court held that a full adversary hearing was required prior to the issuance of a search warrant for the seizure of allegedly obscene material. Thus, the failure to provide an adversary hearing prior to the seizure of the film violated defendant's constitutional rights. For the same reason, the arrest warrant was issued in violation of defendant's constitutional rights because no adversary hearing was held prior to issuance of the arrest warrant. The indictment was quashed because of the likelihood that the grand jury relied upon the unconstitutional arrest, seizure, and determination of obscenity when it indicted defendant.</SPAN></P>

He argued that he should have been acquitted because the Secretary of Highways (Pennsylvania Department of Highways) lacked authority to establish the restricted speed zone through which defendant was clocked and, in the alternative, the official signs required by the Act, indicating the legal speed, were not properly spaced. The court rejected both claims. First, it noted that &sect; 1002 was intended to establish specific speed limits over which the secretary had no control to alter; and second, leaving within the discretion of the secretary to establish speeds where conditions of the highway made it safe to operate a motor vehicle at speeds other than provided by the Act. Consequently, the only restriction placed on the secretary was to ascertain if traffic conditions made it safe to operate at speeds other than as provided by the Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had driven a panel truck, registered in his name, with more than 5,000 cigarettes as cargo. At the time, he knew that he was carrying cigarettes as cargo. The court concluded that the jury could have found that he was in possession of more than 5,000 cigarettes, although innocently because he did not know that the stamps were counterfeit. The court determined that &sect; 3169.903(b) made possession alone a crime, even though there was no proof of criminal knowledge or intent. The court noted that in dealing with &quot;mere possession&quot; statutes and with other statutes making criminal an act done with no criminal knowledge or intent, Pennsylvania's courts had found that it was for the legislature to determine whether the public injury, threatened in any particular matter, was such and so great as to justify an absolute and indiscriminate prohibition. Although the court was troubled by the fact that no criminal knowledge or intent was required by &sect; 3169.903(b), it felt compelled to defer to the legislature as was done in earlier cases. Thus, the court &quot;rejected&quot; defendant's argument that &sect; 3169.903(b) denied his right to due process.</SPAN></P>

The raceway did not, however, allege that its property amounted to 25 percent or more of the total valuation as assessed for taxable purposes. Instead, the raceway claimed that, together with its customers, it accounted for more than 25 percent of the Township's total tax revenues. Therefore, the raceway did not have standing to appeal under the Act. The court noted that found that the Act of December 31, 1965, P.

The court disagreed and dismissed the action. The court held that the possibility of being taxed with costs after the party has had his day in court was not equivalent to a prior restraint upon access to the courts. The Act merely discouraged the filing of improper criminal charges and had only an incidental effect on those bringing charges in good faith.

The court held that the borough was only authorized to raise revenue via taxes, assessments, sales of municipal services, fines, and license fees. There was no provision of law for the imposition of any tax for the special support of the police department or for the assessment of the cost of the police force. Police service was a government function that could not be sold. There was no activity for which a fine was imposed. The showing of X-rated movies indiscriminately to adults and children was a business activity which could be licensed under the police power.

The court ruled that the law was not unconstitutional and did not violate Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 27 also known as the equal rights amendment which prohibited different treatment of different sexes because the law did not create an arbitrary or capricious difference. The court ruled that the class protected by this law was not all women at the expense of all men, but rather only women of limited financial resources. The law was intended to assist a wife's with her legal representation when she had insufficient funds to pay for such representation. The court noted that many women were homemakers and had no income independent of their husbands. Indeed, the law was intended to promote the administration of fair and impartial justice by placing both parties on an equal playing field.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Additional defendants, plaintiff's employer and the administratrix of the estate of the first deceased, filed a motion for summary judgment in plaintiff's action for personal injuries arising from an automobile accident. Plaintiff originally filed the suit against a car dealership that employed the driver of one of the cars involved in the accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was a passenger in a truck driven by a fellow employee, the first decedent. Both were in the course of their employment. The truck collided with another truck owned by the car dealership and operated by a car dealership employee, the second decedent. Plaintiff filed a complaint against the car dealership, which filed a defendant's complaint joining the administratrix of the estate of the first decedent and plaintiff's employer as additional defendants. The joinder was made on the basis of sole liability or liability over for contribution, or that the additional defendants were jointly or severally liable with the original defendant. The additional defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The court found that the Workmen's Compensation Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 72, prevented the joinder by an original defendant of a co-employee of plaintiff where such joinder was sought on the basis of contribution and the injury was suffered by plaintiff during the course of his employment. The court held that the estate of the co-employe, the first decedent, was immune from liability in the matter by way of contribution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion for summary judgment by the administratrix of the estate of the first decedent was sustained. The motion for partial summary judgment in favor of the employer was granted to the end that the employer could be liable to the car dealership on the basis of contribution only to the extent of its Workmen's Compensation coverage. The complaint against the additional defendants on the basis of sole liability was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The key issue was whether or not there was an unreasonable seizure of defendant's person in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state trooper arrived after defendant's car accident. The trooper did not see defendant actually drive the car, but first saw him as he sat behind the wheel with his engine and lights off. He had the odor of alcohol on his breath and exhibited signs of impairment, so the trooper asked him to step out of the car and take a field sobriety test. When defendant failed that test, he was arrested. Defendant later test 0.18 percent on the breathalyzer. Defendant argued that his arrest was illegal, and that therefore the breathalyzer and field sobriety test results were inadmissible. The court held that under Pennsylvania law, sitting behind the wheel of a vehicle that was not operating was not &quot;driving&quot; the vehicle. Therefore, the trooper did not see defendant driving his car. Pennsylvania law required that to arrest a suspect for a misdemeanor, the arresting officer actually had to witness the commission of the offense. That meant that defendant's arrest was illegal, even though the trooper had probable cause by federal constitutional standards. In addition, defendant's compliance could not be considered voluntary under the circumstances and the trooper's show of authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to suppress the field sobriety test and breathalyzer test granted but denied the motion to quash the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the owner of record and the equitable owner sought a zoning change from A Business to B Business, a hearing was held by the Board, but the board made no findings of facts. After the Board denied the application, the owner of record and the equitable owner filed a zoning appeal notice in the office of the court prothonotary. The court dismissed the appeal, holding that under the present status of the record, it did not have authority to decide the case on the merits. Section 911 of the Code set out the only circumstances in which there could be a direct appeal to a court of common pleas on a zoning case from any body other than the zoning hearing board. Those exceptions were cases involving planned residential development ordinances and subdivision and land development ordinances. Because the owner of record and the equitable owner sought to test the validity of the Ridley Township Zoning Ordinance as it restricted them in the use of their property, they had to first apply to the zoning hearing board. In addition, there was no clear record for appellate review because there were no findings of fact or sworn testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an uninsured motorist, was involved in an automobile accident that resulted in damages to the other vehicle. Defendant was notified that unless he complied with the requirements of &sect; 1404 of the Code, his driving privileges would be revoked. Defendant failed to comply, and his driver's license was suspended. Defendant was apprehended while driving and was charged with operating during suspension. He asserted the defense that his license had not been legally revoked. The court dismissed the charge because the suspension of his license was void where &sect; 1494 was unconstitutional. The court noted that &sect; 1404 was closely akin to the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act of Georgia, which was held to violate constitutional procedural due process standards by depriving uninsured licensees of a hearing. The hearing process provided by the Code had to be initiated by defendant and could only be initiated after the automatic suspension of the license. Section 1404 violated the due process rights provided by the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the motion to suppress the breathalyzer evidence because it determined that the right to have a doctor perform a test at the same time as the statutory test was not a constitutionally protected right, but rather, was a statutory right that did not require that the police officer advise defendant of his option under the statute at the time he requested the test.

At issue were the rights of an accused and the duties of the police under the Pennsylvania Implied Consent Statute, Act of April 29, 1959, P. L. 58, &sect; 624.1, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 75, &sect; 624.1(a)-(c), &sect; 624.3(e), (g), and (h).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Implied Consent Statute, anyone who operated a motor vehicle in Pennsylvania consented to a breath test. A driver could refuse the test but would have his operator's license suspended. Defendant was asked to take a breath test to determine his blood alcohol level. He refused and then later complied. The test revealed his blood alcohol level to be sufficient for conviction. On the motion to suppress, the court held that the presumption of guilt for a blood alcohol weight of over 10 percent was rationally supported by conclusions of the scientific community. Because the offense of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor was not committed in an officer's presence, an arrest warrant should have been obtained and the chemical test administered substantially contemporaneous with the arrest. The test results were the fruit of an illegal arrest and were not admissible. The test itself was not a violation of the privilege against self-incrimination because it did not compel testimonial or communicative information. Evidence of defendant's refusal to take the test was relevant; comment upon his refusal was proper. He had no right to counsel before testing.</SPAN></P>

L. (1955) 1154, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 50, &sect; 3101, et seq. and to allow him to compromise claims under &sect; 416 of the Act. Respondent, the ward's counsel, argued that the expenses should be paid from the sale of the ward's jointly owned property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 644 of the Pennsylvania Incompetents' Estates Act allowed the court to direct payment of the income or principal of an incompetent's estate for the care, maintenance, or education of the incompetent, his spouse, or children. The ward was committed to a mental hospital in lieu of a prison sentence. To pay estate debts, the guardian sold the jointly owned property of the ward and his wife and split the balance between them, a decision confirmed by the court. In the first petition, the guardian asked the court for permission to pay the County for the ward's past and current maintenance, to pay the Commonwealth for his past hospitalization, to reimburse the ward's wife for payment of his child's past hospitalization, to pay a lien on a boat, and to pay attorney and guardian fees. The court reviewed all of these claims in light of its duty to conserve the ward's estate and held that the claims should be held in abeyance pending an accounting under &sect; 416 of the Act. In the second petition, the court assessed the costs of the ward's mental health care and maintenance against his estate pursuant to the Pennsylvania Mental Health Act and the ward's own commitment order.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the guardian's petition to pay income from the ward's estate to the Commonwealth and to the County for his past maintenance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant licensee sought review from an order of appellee Secretary of Transportation (Pennsylvania), which revoked his operator's license for a motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee contended that &sect; 616 of The Vehicle Code, under which act his operator's privileges were withdrawn, was unconstitutional on its face as being violative of procedural due process. He further contended that &sect; 616(a)(4) was unconstitutional as being a wrongful exercise of the Commonwealth's police power. The court found nothing in the case to suggest that the &quot;emergency situation&quot; exception to the general rule regarding the suspension of operators' licenses was applicable. Section 616 provided for summary revocation of operator's privileges. The court sought to determine whether the notice or opportunity for hearing with respect to the underlying offense was sufficient to meet the constitutional requirement. The court found that notice had not been so afforded to the licensee. The court concluded that it was impossible to find any real and substantial relation between the classification set forth in the statutory subsection under which his license was revoked and the object sought to be obtained by the revocation.</SPAN></P>

The wife sought a divorce under &sect; 11 of the Act of May 2, 1929, P.L. 1237, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 11, which provided that it shall be lawful for a wife to obtain a divorce from bed and board of her husband. The husband alleged that &sect; 11 was unconstitutional and therefore the court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter. On review, the court sustained the husband's preliminary objections. The court held that the provisions of the law discriminated between sexes in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Pa. Const. art. 27. The court held that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 11 denied husbands an equal opportunity for alimony, child custody, and support. The court declared that complaints in divorce for bed and board should no longer be recognized.

The court determined that the Pennsylvania Flag Desecration Statute was not a statute, which compelled adherence to any belief or which prevented a person from speaking or even protesting upon an issue. Defendant was not being forced to love his country or his flag or to pledge allegiance to either. Defendant's contention that statute was constitutionally vague in that it failed to provide any reasonable standard was without merit. Each prescribed activity was clearly defined in plain and simple language. There was ample evidence from which the jury could have found that defendant, even though he arrived with some of the students, was not connected with a student rally in the sense that he was not in any way concerned with the problem under discussion; namely, the increased tuition.</SPAN></P>

The township also sought to have the company compelled to move the structure so that it was in compliance with the setback ordinance. The company filed demurrers. The court found that it was not without jurisdiction to decide the case on the merits. The township had brought an action at law before a district justice of the peace to collect the penalties prescribed by the Electric Cooperative Corporation Act of June 21, 1937, P. L. 1969 (Pennsylvania). The district justice dismissed the action on the grounds that the ordinances were unconstitutional and no appeal was taken from that decision. Thus, the claim was barred by res judicata. The court also found that an action in equity could not be maintained because the remedy at law permitting a penalty against the company was adequate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers, a university and a club, filed a complaint in assumpsit against defendant, City of Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania), seeking a refund of taxes paid under protest under Pittsburgh, Pa., Institution and Service Privilege Tax Ordinance on the gross annual receipts of their nonprofit services. The taxpayers were non-profit organizations. They argued that they were entitled to a refund because the Ordinance taxed prohibited fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers also contended that the Ordinance was unworkable legislation, that the Local Enabling Act of Dec. 31, 1965, Pa.

However, it held that the City's taxing power was limited to two mills on gross receipts from the service of food and drink and rendered a verdict for the taxpayers for taxes paid in excess of two mills. The tax on the taxpayers' gross receipts was not a tax on membership due, fees, or assessments. These were charges and not dues. The constitutionality of the Ordinance was not passed upon. The exclusion of purely public charities from the Ordinance's effect did not make the Ordinance invalid. The Enabling Act clearly did not exclude non-profit organizations from the tax limitation that applied to places where food, drink, and refreshments were served. The City's taxing power was derived from the Enabling Act, which specifically limited the tax to two mills. The Ordinance's use of the word service was clear and definite. The Ordinance was not vague or indefinite.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed preliminary objections asserting that the court did not have jurisdiction in the matter because neither party met the one year residency requirement set forth in &sect; 16 of the Divorce Law of May 29, 1929, P. L. 1237, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 16. Plaintiff argued that the statutory requirement of one year residence was unconstitutional. The court held that the residency requirement was constructional, sustained defendant's preliminary objections, and dismissed the action. The Commonwealth had a compelling State interest in preserving the sanctity of its divorce decrees and the classification created by the statutory residency requirement was consequently justified by said compelling interest. The court held that bona fide residence for a period of one year, imposed as the minimum jurisdictional requirement for the institution of a divorce action, was justified by a compelling interest of the Commonwealth and was constitutional within the requirements of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer had been deducting the employee's wages for payment to a finance company based in Ohio by virtue of attachment or garnishment proceedings instituted against the employee in an Ohio court. At issue was whether the employer had the right to do that. The court ordered the preliminary injunction, finding that there was a long-standing, strong public policy in Pennsylvania against garnishment of wages and in favor of preferential treatment of wage earners. The rule of comity did not necessarily require the court to give full faith and credit to statutes and legal processes of sister States that were a form of economic peonage and were abhorrent to Pennsylvania's public policy. Rather, the court should prevent the evasion of the laws of Pennsylvania and protect resident wage earners from potentially unconstitutional treatment by the judicial processes of sister States, especially where those processes directly affected or interfered with a local employer-employee relationship.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the employer be temporarily restrained and enjoined from paying over compensation or wages thereafter to be earned by the employee under and by virtue of attachment proceedings directed against the employee in the State of Ohio, without prejudice to the employer's right to place the wages in a special escrow fund pending final order of the court.</SPAN></P>

No public notice was given of the meeting at which the ordinance was finally adopted. In fact the township had represented to protestors that no action would be taken until a later date. The court held that the township violated the Public Notice Act, even though it had given notice of the prior meetings when the ordinance was discussed. It was required to give notice of the meeting at which the ordinance was enacted, although it was not require to give notice that the ordinance would come up for action at that meeting. The court also held that the ordinance was not properly enacted. The Pennsylvania Township Zoning Ordinance, &sect; 2104, required a two-thirds majority to enact a rezoning ordinance where 20 percent of abutting landowners protested.

Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 1601, and under a survival statute, Pa. Stat. Ann. 20, &sect; 320.603. At issue was whether the widow was required to comply with notice provisions in Pa. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow's husband was killed in an altercation involving a bus operated by the authority in November 1970. His widow filed a wrongful death and survival suit in June 1971.

The court then concluded that the authority was not entitled to judgment on the pleadings, and it denied that motion. Interpreting &sect; 2036, the court held that the widow was not a person who was suing the authority &quot;for damages on account of any injury to his person.&quot; The court thereupon pointed out that the person who had suffered &quot;an injury to his person&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 2036 in fact was the widow's deceased husband. Because neither the widow nor the husband's personal representative suffered any injury to their &quot;persons,&quot; the court held that the notice provision did not apply to them and that the motion for judgment on the pleadings was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant kept on his property a number of old cars which he was in the process of repairing or remodeling. Defendant was charged for violating a township ordinance restricting the placement on his property of automobiles which were uninspected. He was tried before a justice of the peace and convicted. That conviction was appealed and the court found defendant guilty of violating the ordinance and assessed him fine and costs. Defendant was unrepresented and no appeal was taken. Defendant was convicted a second time. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance and attacked the sufficiency of the evidence. The court reversed, concluding that (1) the record did not sustain Commonwealth's public health and safety concerns and the complaint really centered on the lack of aesthetic value of the cars on the property; (2) the Commonwealth failed to sustain its burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was maintaining a nuisance; and (3) an ordinance to be constitutionally valid must forbid or require the doing of an act in terms which were not so vague that men of common intelligence had to guess at its meaning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an eminent domain proceeding, defendant, the Commonwealth, filed a motion for an order allowing the jury to view the subject premises, including a house, despite the fact that the house had been relocated to a different portion of the overall premises. Plaintiff owners objected to the proposed order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the owners' land was taken in an eminent domain proceeding, their residence apparently was relocated to a new site and sold to new owners. The Commonwealth then sought an order allowing a jury view of the old site and the relocated house. The owners objected. The court granted the motion in part and denied it in part. While noting that the law generally provided for a right of view, the proper construction of the present enabling statute required the conclusion that that which was seen at the time of the view was evidentiary in nature. Because the value of the home might well be determined by its structure and by the way it was sited on specific land, a view of the house on a different lot was not necessarily appropriate. In denying the order for a view of the house, the court also noted that any inspection of the house was limited to the exterior because there was no undertaking by the Commonwealth to obtain from the new owners a right for the jury to view of the interior nor an agreement from the new owners allowing the jury to traverse their land. Accordingly, while the motion to view the premises was granted, the motion to view the house was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the Commonwealth's motion to the extent that it sought a view of the premises themselves but denied the motion to the extent that it sought a view of the residence as severed from the real estate and relocated elsewhere.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borough's ordinances set minimum lot widths, set building height limits, and limited the number of units that could be built on a given area. Two ordinances were adopted after the owners purchased their property. The restrictions reduced the economic value of the property. The owners contended the borough was in violation of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code of January 1, 1969 (Code), P.L., Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect;&sect; 10101-11202. The court held that (1) although the borough had not yet adopted a comprehensive plan that complied with all of the specific requirements outlined the Code, the borough did have a comprehensive and orderly plan of land use that reflected a rational zoning scheme, (2) the ordinances were designed to serve a justifiable purpose and were in accordance with an overall program, with a reasonable relationship to the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community, (3) there was no evidence of spot zoning or arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable action, and (4) the borough was required to adopt a comprehensive plan and supplement its zoning ordinances with a statement of community development objectives as required by the Code.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued caveats that the borough was to come into compliance with the planning code and it kept the record open for further additional relevant testimony as suggested by its opinion.</SPAN></P>

The granting of permission was done under &sect; 42.30 of the Township of Hickory, Pennsylvania, Ordinance No. 13.70, which pertained to volunteer fire department facilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents challenged the constitutionality of the Ordinance. The testimony of the Board was never transcribed. For that reason no record was before the court. Accordingly, the court held that the case had to be held de novo. The court held that a presumption of validity attached to a zoning ordinance, which imposed a burden to prove its invalidity upon the one whom challenged it. The court found that the erection of the firehouse and social hall was not violative of the ordinance. Whether the ordinance permitting the erection of fire houses and public halls bore a substantial relationship to the public safety or general welfare had to await the submission of evidence to the court. The burden of proving clearly and unmistakably the unconstitutionality of the ordinance was upon the residents. The court also found that the residents had to be given an opportunity to present evidence which supported the proposition that the Township had circumvented the requirement of a municipal election in the selection of the location of the fire house as required under the Act of May 27, 1949, P. L. 1955, &sect; 31, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 56517.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant obtained a rule to show cause why the entire grand jury panel selected for a certain term should not be dismissed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought to dismiss the entire grand jury panel. The jury commissioners selected the majority of the panel by choosing every fiftieth person from the most recent voter registration list. The procedure resulted in a shortage of jurors, so the commissioners added the necessary names in an equal one-third, one-third, one-third basis. The court held that defendant failed to sustain his challenge. The court found that the Act of April 10, 1867, P.L. 62, &sect; 2, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 942, was complied with and that there was not a failure to select the jury panel from the whole qualified electors of &quot;sober, intelligent, and judicious&quot; persons. The fact that the process systematically excluded persons who had failed to register to vote but were otherwise qualified was not a violation of equal protection because all persons of legal age had the opportunity to register to vote. The fact that some of the additional jurors chosen had some political connection was not a ground for quashing the entire array. Similarly, the failure to seal the jury wheel was not a ground for quashing the entire array because defendant's rights were not infringed by the departure from the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court discharged the rule to show cause and authorized the Commonwealth to present the case against defendant to the grand jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of an auditors' report filed for Warminster Township for a certain fiscal year. Appellees were four of the five-man board of supervisors of the township who held office during that year. It was alleged that these four public officials were liable for a surcharge for certain illegal expenditures received by them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township employed a part-time town manager. To keep up with township business, the board assigned to each of the four members an area of responsibility. Each member was employed at $ 100 per month for services rendered as directors in their respective areas of responsibility. The court found that each of the supervisors performed his duties and accepted the monthly compensation in the firm belief that he was legally entitled thereto; that the supervisors' activities as directors removed the need of a full-time manager for the township for the year in question; and that had a full-time manager been engaged for that year, the expense of his salary would have exceeded the amount paid to the part-time manager and the supervisors. Nonetheless, the court found that the supervisors were liable to the town for the payments they received because they had no power to engage themselves as compensable township employees. The services performed by the supervisors fell within the scope of their duties as supervisors of the township, and the Second Class Township Code provided how and within what limits supervisors could be compensated.</SPAN></P>

First, the court held that on certiorari, every presumption consistent with the record had to be made in favor of its regularity. Second, Pa. R. Crim. P. 107 required written notice in the form of a summons before issuance of a warrant unless the defendant was unknown, a nonresident, or not known to be a resident and the issuing authority had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would not obey a summons. Here, defendants were longtime residents of their township. Third, the provisions of &sect; 1202 of the Game Law requiring summary proceedings to be brought before the nearest available magistrate in the county were mandatory, and jurisdiction depended upon their observance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, plaintiffs in a personal injury action filed a motion to remove a compulsory nonsuit, and defendants, in a breach of contract action, filed a motion for a new trial after a jury returned a verdict for plaintiffs. The cases all involved the issue of whether the court could require a case to be tried at a given time despite the fact that one of the litigant's counsel was unavailable due to other commitments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The same firm and attorney were involved in all cases. In the personal injury action, the pleadings, other than the complaint, bore the signature of an attorney in the firm. When the case was called for trial, a firm representative stated that only a certain member of the firm could try the cases and that he was scheduled for trial in federal court. When neither plaintiffs nor counsel appeared and no testimony was offered in support of their claims, a compulsory nonsuit was entered. In the breach of contract action, a firm representative again stated that the member of the firm designated to try the cases was scheduled for trial in federal court. Plaintiff put in its case, and a verdict was returned in its favor. The movants contended that the requested delays should have been granted because there was only one counsel familiar with the cases and he had a scheduling conflict. The court found that other attorneys had done the bulk of the preliminary matters and that those attorneys were familiar with the cases and were competent to try them. The court found that its published trial policy was not unreasonable and that its application in these cases was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the instant appeal, appellant, a motor vehicle operator, questioned the withdrawal, pursuant to the provisions of The Vehicle Code of Apr. 29, 1959, P. L. 58, &sect; 1404, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 75, &sect; 1404, of his motor vehicle privileges by the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation until he should post security or furnish a release from the other party involved with him in a certain motor vehicle accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator contended on appeal that he had a defense to any civil action which might arise out of the accident and, therefore, could not be held liable to any person in any manner, that the Secretary failed to make an adequate investigation or secure adequate information pertaining to the accident, that the amount of security demanded was excessive, that the operator was in need of his operating privileges in order to support his family, and that the statute was unconstitutional in that it was violative of due process. The court stated that in view of the fact that the court on appeal could, and did, stay the suspension and would at the instant time determine whether the Secretary's order was lawful and reasonable, it found that the operator had been accorded the due process to which he was entitled. The court noted that neither at the administrative level nor at the hearing de novo had the Commonwealth produced evidence that there was a reasonable possibility of a judgment being entered against the operator. The court stated that the Commonwealth not having met its burden of proof, the court had to set aside the action of the Secretary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal was sustained, and the Secretary was ordered to reinstate the operator's operating privileges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania charged defendants with possession of explosives with the intent to use them unlawfully against the person or property of another in violation of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4417 (1947), and conspiracy. The Commonwealth refused defendants' application for disclosure of evidence obtained by wiretapping and electronic surveillance. Defendants filed a motion to quash the indictments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, members of the Students for a Democratic Society, associated with another extremist group, the Black Panther Party, to blow up historical sites that symbolized the nation's birth. Federal agents fed information to local police, which showed defendants' connection to the Black Panther Party, and the plot. In considering defendants' motion to quash the indictments, the court held that the U.S. Attorney General instructed a federal agent not to respond to questions that asked whether federal agents obtained information via wiretaps or electronic surveillance. The court found that it was reasonable to conclude that federal agents intercepted conversations that unveiled defendants' plan. The court held that local police might have seized explosives only after using such information. The court held that if the federal agents illegally seized the conversations, then it was a Fourth Amendment violation that barred the use of tainted evidence. the court granted the U.S. Attorney General an opportunity to provide the requested information on possible illegal wiretaps. The court held that if the federal government refused, then the court would quash defendants' indictments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was granted leave for 20 days to confer with the U.S. Attorney General. If the Attorney General permitted the agent to provide additional testimony, the court would conduct further proceedings in accordance with its opinion and order. If no permission was granted, defendants' motion to quash the indictments was to be granted, upon motion to the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's operating privileges were suspended by reason of a motor vehicle accident. By reason of the same accident, the driver was charged with commission of a criminal offense. The driver filed a motion to stay the hearing on his appeal from his suspension on the ground that his privilege against self-incrimination would be violated by a hearing in the civil appeal proceedings before final disposition of the criminal charges arising out of the same transaction. The court denied the driver's motion to delay the civil appeal hearing and held that there was nothing in the appeal proceedings that would compel the driver's testimony, and nothing appeared from which it could conclude that the driver's failure to testify would be held as grounds for suspension of his operating privileges. The court ruled that there was nothing before the court from which it could find that the driver would not be accorded the full scope of Fifth Amendment rights. The court held that the driver could assert the privilege against self-incrimination in the suspension proceedings but had no constitutional right to be relieved of the burden of that choice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Christian schools brought an action against defendants, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Instruction, and the Pennsylvania State Board of Private Academic Schools to enjoin defendants from requiring the schools to be licensed pursuant to the Pennsylvania Private Academic Schools Act of June 25, 1947, (1947 P.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Christian schools contended that they operated by and under the authority of bona fide religious institutions, but defendants asserted the schools were not &quot;bona fide religious institutions&quot; as contemplated by the Pennsylvania Private Academic Schools Act of June 25, 1947, (1947 P. L. 951, amended by 1968 P. L. 695, &sect; 1 (Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect;&sect; 2731 and 2732 (1963))). The court determined from the charters of the schools that the schools required that their students receive Biblical instruction and Christian training, which was the primary purpose of establishing the schools. The court held that pursuant to &sect; 2 of the Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 2732 (1963), the schools were exempted from the requirement of obtaining a license from the Board. The court also held that the Pennsylvania Legislature had the authority to enact legislation which contained exemptions and that the court was not authorized to question the Legislature's intent in doing so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court decreed that defendants were enjoined instituting any legal proceedings against the schools or instructing or permitting officials of the Commonwealth to institute any legal proceedings against the schools and that defendants were directed to countermand any previous instructions regarding the institution of legal proceedings against the schools.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student was instructed on three occasions that the length of his hair did not comport with school district dress code regulations. The student complied twice, but on the third occasion, resisted. He was excluded from school by the school board. The student filed an application for an injunction against the school district and the school officials. The court granted a preliminary injunction and held a hearing as to whether the injunction should be made permanent. After the hearing, the court dissolved the injunction. The court held that the school district had the authority under the Act of March 10, 1949, 1949 P. L. 30, art. V, &sect; 510, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 5-510, to create rules and regulations for students. The court distinguished this case from one that required students to cut hair to a particular length and reasoned that this particular regulation did not require a cutting of hair to a required length, and was reasonable regulation based on a legitimate state interest in the orderly administration of the school system. The court concluded that there was no irreparable harm, nor would there be any irreparable harm to compel the student to adhere with the dress code.</SPAN></P>

The Attorney General brought an action in mandamus, arguing that the Fiscal Code unequivocally and unqualifiedly confirmed the finality of the Governor's decision requiring the payment of the requisitions. The court reviewed the law and concluded that the State Treasurer, being a high constitutional officer of the Commonwealth, had the right to raise the question whether the Governor was empowered under the circumstances &quot;to decide the issue&quot; under &sect; 1502 of the Fiscal Code and ignore the Board of Arbitration of Claims, which the legislature created &quot;to hear and determine all claims against the Commonwealth arising from contracts hereafter entered into with the Commonwealth.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council ordained a bill redistricting the boundaries of councilmanic districts. The voters sought to nullify the bill, claiming that it was invalid, unconstitutional, and unlawful. They also sought to postpone the last date for filing nomination petitions for district councilmen in the primary election. The court ruled in favor of the voters in part. It held that although at the time of the enactment of the city council made use of the best available population figures at its disposal, errors in block figures subsequently submitted had been discovered. The councilmanic districts existing prior to the enactment of the bill so varied in population as to be unconstitutional under the one-man one-vote principle. There was insufficient time, in light of the provisions of the Election Code of Pennsylvania, 1937 Pa. Laws 1333, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 25, &sect; 2600 et seq., to reconsider redistricting the presently existing councilmanic districts established under the bill.

In April 1970, defendant escaped from jail and was returned to Pennsylvania to face federal charges. Defendant was sentenced by a federal court. Defendant claimed that he was entitled to a dismissal under the &quot;two-term rule.&quot; The court disagreed, holding that the discharge authorized by the Act of 1860 was a discharge from confinement only. Moreover, the court held that because defendant's escape prevented his trial, he was not entitled to a discharge. Defendant also argued that he was entitled to a dismissal because he was not brought to trial within 180 days as required by the Act of 1957. The court found that the 180 days had not yet expired and that the Act of 1957 only applied to those imprisoned pursuant to a conviction. Defendant had not been convicted but was confined due to his failure to post bail. The court also held that defendant's speedy trial rights had not been violated because the delay was caused by defendant's escape.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">More than two years after the alleged offenses were committed, an indictment was approved charging defendant with four drug-related counts. After defendant filed a motion to quash two of the counts, a grand jury approved a second indictment identical to the first except that it contained an allegation that defendant was not a resident of the Commonwealth during the time following the alleged offenses. The court agreed with defendant's argument that the counts in both indictments related to his corruption of the morals of a child were not supported by the complaint against him. The essential elements required by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4532, including the name and age of the alleged minor, did not appear in the complaint. The complaint of conspiracy was a general allegation of an illegal conspiracy. However, the court found that the running of the two-year statute of limitations was tolled by defendant's residency in another state following the date of the alleged offenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in admitting the results of a breathalyzer test because the test was performed more than an hour and a half after she had been driving. She continued to contend that the pretrial application was improperly dismissed. Refusing the motion for a new trial, the court found that the summary disposition of the application for dismissal was justifiable. The court found that the complaint was sufficient to advise defendant of the nature of the charges despite the absence of the word &quot;intoxicating&quot; before the word &quot;liquor.&quot; The court held that the admission of the breathalyzer test was proper under the implied consent statute, &sect; 624.1(b)(c) of the Vehicle Code, which raised a presumption that defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor if her blood-alcohol content reached a certain level. The admissibility of the results was a matter within the trial court's discretion, and there was no statutory limitation as to the time within which the test should have been given. The court found that defendant was not prejudiced and that the implied consent statute was presumed constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that the inmate was not a medical doctor but was a motorcycle mechanic. While the court expressed its regret that the question of the constitutionality of &sect; 4718 reached the court in its present posture, and it commented that the inmate's actions were reprehensible, the court concluded that &sect; 4718 was unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 4718 was not sufficiently narrow in scope to serve the limited purpose involved because of its broad, unlimited, and indiscriminate application. Further, the court held that &sect; 4718 clearly impinged on constitutionally protected areas. The court noted that the U.S. Supreme Court recognized a constitutionally protected right to privacy, which was made applicable to the States through U.S. Const. amend XIV. The court said that abortion statute interfered with an individual's private right to have or not to have children. The court reasoned that the statute was at odds with current medical practice, invaded the intimate realm of marital privacy, interfered with a married couple's freedom to control the number and spacing of offspring, and was in conflict with a solution to one of the world's critical problems, population explosion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board's preliminary objections set forth objections to the jurisdiction of the court, to the failure to state a cause of action in the complaint, and to approximately 52 additional alleged errors in the drafting of the complaint. The complaint alleged damage to the association as a result of error on the part of the board in its actions and nonactions relating to failure to approve plastic pipe for use in construction. The court dismissed the preliminary objections. The board's argument that permitting the association to maintain the statutory appeal would have had some allegedly undesirable consequences was without merit. The desirability or undesirability of the plastic pipe products involved in the dispute could be demonstrated at the trial of the case, if trial was necessary. The board had succeeded in delaying, for more than a year and a half, a clarification of the legal status of plastic pipe materials for plumbing purposes in the county. Further delay was a great injustice. The board made no attempt to show real prejudice resulting from the inclusion in the statutory appeal complaint of any allegedly improper matter.</SPAN></P>

Each truck was in excess of the weight permissible under &sect; 903(a). Defendants were found guilty and fined. Defendants argued that, they were deprived of equal protection of the law in that the police engaged in a method of enforcement that systematically eliminated other truck drivers and truck owners in competition with the owner of the scales, which was directly or indirectly in competition with their employer. The court disagreed and found defendant's guilty as charged. Defendants failed to carry their burden of showing that the application of the overweight provisions of the Vehicle Code to them constituted such a willful, intentional, and malicious discrimination as to result in a deprivation of their equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Regardless of whether the local authorities could lawfully suspend application of the Vehicle Code overweight provisions to trucks operating on the highways under construction, their purpose in doing so was rationally and reasonably related to the expeditious completion of a highway construction project.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried by a judge without a jury for having turned out his automobile lights to avoid arrest. He was apprehended by a Cheltenham Township police officer, who had pursued defendant into Philadelphia in connection with another matter. The offense occurred on a small side street approximately 200 feet on the Philadelphia side of the county line. Defendant was charged with a misdemeanor under the Vehicle Code and taken before a justice of the peace in Montgomery County. He was subsequently indicted, it being alleged that the offense took place in Montgomery County. At the time of trial, defendant did not deny the charge, but maintained that the court had no jurisdiction to try him, since the events and the arrest occurred in Philadelphia. The Commonwealth relied on the Act of March 31, 1860, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 524. Defendant argued that a 1968 amendment to Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 14 rendered the Act of 1860 unconstitutional. The court found that a court of record had no more and no fewer restrictions than it had prior to the adoption of Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 14.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The condemnee contended that Pa. Stat.

The condemnee alleged that the fair market value of the land condemned for the roadside rest area exceeded the amount authorized by the statute. The court held an examination of the language of the statute clearly indicated that it was intended to be a limitation upon the power of the Department to acquire and construct roadside rests rather than a limitation upon the right of a property owner to secure just compensation. The Commonwealth contended that the condemnee's objections were premature and that he should not be permitted to challenge the validity of the taking until the amount of just compensation had been finally determined in accordance with the Eminent Domain Code. The court concluded that that the Commonwealth was required to aver with specificity the cost of planning, acquisition, construction, and erection of the roadside rest area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district contended that the collection of the tax should not have been enjoined because of the financial hardship it would cause to the school district itself and its taxpayers and the disruption which would follow in its educational program. At the hearing, the defense was variously called the defense of laches or equitable estoppel. The court reasoned that laches required not only a passage of time, but also a resultant prejudice to the party asserting the doctrine. The court found that the taxpayers' delay in bringing the action did not work to the prejudice of the school district. The court held that because laches was an affirmative defense that the school district had the burden of proving, and because its proofs did not sustain its position that it had been prejudiced by the delay of the taxpayers, that defense was not sustained. Equitable estoppel applied where, because of something that had been done, a party was denied the right to plead or prove an otherwise important fact. The court held that the same reasons which militated against a finding of laches also precluded the application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.</SPAN></P>

XIV and the Corporate Net Income Tax Act of May 16, 1935, P. L. 208, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 3420, sought review of a tax settlement order of the Board of Finance and Revenue of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in favor of appellee Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in a proceeding to determine the amount of corporate income tax owed by the taxpayer, a broadcasting company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer contended on appeal that its operations were multiform and that it could thus utilize separate accounting, and it argued that a disproportionate amount of its income had been allocated to Pennsylvania and that the tax was arbitrary because it would have been substantially lower if local operations were transferred to a subsidiary corporation. The court sustained the resettlement. The court stated that it appeared inescapable that the many local operations of the taxpayer actually contributed to the success of the whole business enterprise and that where such connecting links had been found to exist, the taxpayer had to report on a unitary basis. The court noted that the tax was not a tax on the privilege of conducting an isolated activity in Pennsylvania, but upon the privilege of extending the total corporate activity into the Commonwealth, and it stated that the tax could be based upon an allocated portion of the income of the total business rather than upon the separate income of the unit situated in the Commonwealth.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Alleging that he was a taxpayer of unspecified taxes and that this was a taxpayers' class action, plaintiff asserted that the statute was unconstitutional in that it originated in the Senate instead of the House, contrary to Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 10; in that its original purpose was changed during passage from a bill raising revenue to an unnamed purpose, contrary to Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 1; and in that it assigned the first $ 10,000,000 of revenues raised to religious schools, contrary to Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. The remaining averments of the complaint asserted a personal cause of action in the taxpayer for damage to his reputation and as violative of his civil rights. The court held that the complaint was devoid of any averment of payment of the particular taxes imposed by the act or of the payment of any state tax. It was equally silent as to the manner or means by which their imposition or expenditure would directly or indirectly adversely affect him or those of his class. Under such circumstances, the taxpayer had not demonstrated a standing to contest the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal thrust of the complaint was directed to that part Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 75, &sect; 625.1, which required any person operating or riding on a motorcycle to wear both protective headgear and an eye shield. The motorcyclists contended that this violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution and Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 7. It was conceded that the act classified operators of motorcycles differently than operators of other motor vehicles as to the wearing of protective headgear and eye shields. The court held that to require operators of motorcycles to wear protective headgear and eye shields was not an unreasonable classification considering the obvious and inherent difference between the operation of a motorcycle and the driving of other motor vehicles. The motorcyclists further contended that the statute was too vague and indefinite. The court held that regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Revenue were duly reported to the Department of State as required. Therefore, the court concluded that there was no merit to the allegation that the statute was too vague and indefinite to inform motorcyclists of what was required of them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died intestate as to a portion of his estate.

Respondents, the children of the great uncles and great aunts of the decedent, claimed that they were entitled to the distributive estate under the provisions of Pa. Stat.

The court determined that &sect; 1.3(5) did not include the children of an intestate's great uncles and great aunts and, therefore, that the Commonwealth was entitled to the intestate portion of the estate under &sect; 1.3(6).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district's taxing resolutions required employers within the school district to deduct the taxes from the wages of each employee that was liable. The county contended that it was not an employer within the purview of the Act of 1965, and it failed to deduct the taxes. The matter was argued before a chancellor, and the court entered a decree nisi. The county was ordered to deduct the taxes in the future and to make return of the deductions to the school district's tax collector. The court concluded that the county was an employer as defined in Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 6913-I and was clearly intended to be subject to the Act. The Act was not local or special legislation, and therefore, was not unconstitutional under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32. In addition, the Act was not defective under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3 because the title adequately conveyed the substance of the Act. However, the court held that the county was not liable under the forfeiture and penalty provisions of the Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 6913-IV(e), because of the general rule of governmental immunity.</SPAN></P>

When the settlor relinquished his life estate, the trust became irrevocable and the income was payable one-half to his daughter and the other half to his son. The daughter filed exceptions to the auditing report, challenging the apportionment between income and principal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint concerned itself with the implementation of Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, P. L. 89-10, 20 U.S.C.S. &sect; 821 et seq., under which federal funds were made available to states for the purchase of books and other library resources for schools. Under the Act, Pennsylvania received funds upon the condition of filing a detailed plan on how the funds would be administered. Plaintiffs alleged that the state plan was not being followed in accordance with the plan. Defendants filed preliminary objections, claiming that plaintiffs had no standing and that they did not state a cause of action. The court dismissed the objections. On the issue of standing, the court held that a taxpayer had a right and standing to sue to enjoin public officials from wrongfully expending public money and, in such cases, the taxpayer need not have any special interest other than that as a taxpayer. Furthermore, plaintiffs stated a cause of action. It could be that plaintiffs would have difficulty in proving their allegations but that possibility could not be considered on a preliminary objection.</SPAN></P>

The court ordered that the balance for distribution in the custody of the Commonwealth be distributed to the claimants, who alleged that they were the nephews and niece of the decedent and the sole surviving heirs. The court held that the claimants met the burden of proving by clear, precise, and definite evidence both their identity and kinship and that others of equal or closer kinship were not available to inherit. The proof was exclusively documentary. The court accorded prima facie recognition to the official acts and exemplifications by foreign notaries and determined that officially certified and authenticated birth and death records were entitled to credence. Testimonial evidence taken from disinterested witnesses who were citizens of Lithuania and from the claimants supported the records. There were no other claims to the estate and the Commonwealth did not suggest the possibility of other claimants.</SPAN></P>

The legislature provided a remedy to attack the validity of a tax resolution under the Local Tax Enabling Act of 1965, P. L. 1257, &sect; 6 (Pennsylvania), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 6906, by establishing a right to appeal the resolution to the court of quarter sessions within 30 days after enactment. The court found that the taxpayer had not pursued this remedy. Furthermore, however, the law imposed a heavy burden on a taxpayer to establish an alleged unconstitutionality clearly and beyond doubt and, relying upon de facto exemptions as the ground, it was the taxpayer's burden to clearly establish those exemptions that would render the administration of a tax unconstitutional for lack of uniformity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The political party polled enough votes in an election to achieve the status of a political party in the county under the Pennsylvania Election Code Act of June 3, 1937, P.L. 1333, art. VIII, &sect; 801; Act of July 28, 1941, &sect; 1, Pa Stat. Ann. tit. 25, &sect; 2381(b) (&sect; 801). In the next primary, the political party nominated candidates who were also nominated by the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. The Election Code Act was then amended by Act 175. Under Act 175, if a candidate was nominated by more than one party, the name of the candidate was listed once on the ballot with the names of the parties nominating the candidate in parentheses. Under prior practice, if a candidate was nominated twice, he was listed twice on the ballot. However, under Act 175, it could not be determined if a candidate received enough votes for purposes of &sect; 801. Act 175 was designed to prevent void ballots with multiple votes for the same candidate. The court construed the provisions to ascertain the intent of the legislature and held that &sect; 801 was not repealed by implication. Therefore, the political party was entitled to claim 100 percent of cast in the county for the candidates it had nominated.</SPAN></P>

The union asserted that employes engaged in the growing and production of mushrooms were not within the jurisdiction of the Board under the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 211.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union claimed that mushroom growers were agricultural workers, who were not within the jurisdiction of the Board. The court denied the petition for injunctive relief. The court held as follows: (1) the union was not entitled to equitable relief without exhausting all of the administrative remedies because the union did not demonstrate that it was subject to irreparable harm without an adequate remedy; (2) until the union received certification as the representative of the employees in question for the purpose of collective bargaining, it was not subject to any obligation; (3) none of the specific factors alleged by the union in the complaint sufficed to lend credence to the claim of irreparable injury; and (4) the charge of deprivation of the constitutional right of due process had already been considered and dismissed by a United States District Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Secretary of Revenue of Pennsylvania and the Deputy Secretary, filed preliminary objections to the first count of plaintiff taxpayers' complaint in equity by which they asserted that H.R. 1672, which ultimately became Pa. Act No. 414, effective January 1, 1968, was void. Defendants filed a demurrer to the second count of the complaint in which the taxpayers sought to restrain the enforcement of the Tax Act of 1963 for Education.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Tax Act was amended by Act No. 414, which increased the rate of tax upon the sale and use of all tangible personal property. The taxpayers complained that H.R. 1672 had not been passed by a constitutional majority and, therefore, Act No. 414 was void, despite the fact that the bill received the required majority of votes and was certified, approved, and eventually signed by the governor. In the case of first impression, the court found the taxpayers' arguments to be without merit. Contrary to the taxpayers' theory, the court held that the Enrolled Bill Rule applied to alleged substantive violations of constitutional mandates in the enactment of legislation. By this, the court had to presume the regularity in the passage of a law when it was duly approved and certified; the court could not resort to extrinsic evidence. The court held that the Enrolled Bill Rule was undoubtedly the law in Pennsylvania. Because the taxpayers, who claimed the Tax Act was really a tax on income at a graduated scale, failed to meet their burden of proving that the Tax Act violated the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution, the court concluded that the Tax Act was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trooper took the driver to the justice of the peace, where he spoke with his attorney. The driver said nothing more about the test until he was taken to prison. The test was not given. The court held that the request to be tested was made after he had been arrested and charged as the statute required. The court found that he refused the test. The court stated that since the driver had been afforded the right of appeal, which he has exercised, he could not complain of any deprivation of procedural due process. The court also rejected the driver's claims of violation of other constitutional safeguards. The court held that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 75, &sect; 624.1 was constitutionally valid.

There was evidence that the first defendant participated in displaying the flag because the identification was made in daylight with adequate time for observing. The court rejected the contention that &sect; 4211 permitted prosecution only for marking a flag for advertisement. Section 4211 covered a number of acts. In any event, defendants used this means as an advertisement of their ideas. Defendants were guilty regardless of their intent. An exception in &sect; 4211 that the statute did not apply to any patriotic or political demonstrations did not apply to defendants because the court could not conclude that they were conducting a political demonstration. Section 4211 was not arbitrary because it was needed to keep the peace, and it was not constitutionally vague because each proscribed activity was clearly spelled out.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sodomy upon a minor boy, and he moved for a new trial. The court refused his motion. The court held that the trial court properly excluded evidence offered by defendant from a psychiatrist who would have testified that defendant did not possess the characteristics of a sex offender likely to commit sodomy, that he was not a sexual deviate, and that it was improbable that he possessed the necessary intent to be lustful of a boy 13 years of age. No authority was offered for the admission of an opinion to the effect that an accused did or did not possess homosexual characteristics. It was further offered that the psychiatrist would have shown that defendant was of a normal state of mind and was, therefore, not prone to commit the charged crimes. Such testimony was insignificant because people who were married and lived in harmony with their wives could be guilty of sodomy. The defense also offered to prove that boys of the victim's age in puberty were possessed of a disposition to fabricate irresponsible charges of sex offenses against others. The witness who was offered in that regard had not examined the victim, and the offer was general in its terms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died intestate and was survived by a widow and daughter in the Soviet Union. Instead of authorizing immediate payment of the distributive balance in the estate, as requested by the widow and the daughter, the administrator was authorized by the court too forward the fund in periodic payments. Exceptions were filed in behalf of the widow and daughter to the failure of the auditing judges to award the entire balance for distribution to them without restriction. The Commonwealth filed exceptions to the restricted awards authorized by the auditing judges and contends that the entire balance for distribution should have been paid into the State Treasury. The court concluded that (1) 1953 Pa. Laws. 674, and &sect; 737 of the Pa. Fiduciaries Act of 1949, were unconstitutional, as an illegal intrusion by the Commonwealth into the field of foreign affairs, which the United States Constitution entrusted to the President and the Congress; and (2) states were forbidden to withhold distribution of the estates of resident decedents to nationals of Communist countries with whom there were no treaties covering such distributions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act of June 15, 1965, P. L. 133, Pa. Stat.

The court held that the school board committed an ultra vires act when it adopted the complained of resolution and that it was illegally expending public moneys in the transporting of nonpublic school students to parochial schools. The legislative history of Act 91 clearly indicated that the intent of the act was to allow for such transportation only along existing routes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers alleged that defendants, a broadcaster and its subcontractor, erected a pole on their property without their consent and refused to remove it, a continuing trespass entitling them to equitable relief. The crux of the case was whether defendant city could constitutionally grant a private corporation the right to maintain within the right-of-way of public streets poles and wires to transmit television programs to subscribers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Preliminary objections were made as a motion for a more specific complaint and a demurrer. A city ordinance granted a nonexclusive license to a private corporation to erect, maintain, and operate a television transmission and distribution system using poles and wires over, along, across, and upon the city streets and property over which the city had easements or rights-of-way. Defendants contended that the complaint did not state where on the taxpayers' property a pole was erected and how that was a detriment. The court agreed that defendants might have the right to erect a pole on a street or sidewalk where the taxpayers owned the fee and that if the pole constituted an unlawful encroachment on the land, defendants were committing a continuing trespass, an obvious and classic ground for equitable relief. The court refused to hold in a summary proceeding that the city was constitutionally incapable of granting a franchise to use poles and wires over public streets for a community-shared single television antenna when such a license could conceivably be awarded to a private individual or business corporation. The court concluded the complaint was defective as a taxpayers' suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer to the portion of the taxpayers' complaint which asserted the action on behalf of named taxpayers and all other taxpayers of the city. In all other respects, the court overruled preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer and in the nature of a motion for a more specific complaint, with leave to file an answer on the merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation filed an action in assumpsit against defendant town for a refund of a real estate transfer tax imposed by a town ordinance. The corporation alleged that the transfer was not taxable and that the corporation was entitled to a refund under the procedure outlined in the Act of May 21, 1943, P. L. 349, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect;&sect; 5566b and 5566c. The town filed a preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation executed the conveyance at issue to effectuate the corporation's voluntary liquidation. The county recorder of deeds collected the transfer tax as agent for the town. The corporation, relying on precedent holding that a transfer of real estate by a corporation to effect a dissolution was not a taxable transfer within the meaning a state transfer tax statute, sought a refund of the tax imposed by the town. The court held that the complaint was insufficient because it did not contain an averment that a written and verified claim for the refund of the payment was filed with the proper authorities of the political subdivision. That, plus the refusal or failure to make the refund were conditions precedent to the right to bring suit. The court allowed the corporation to file a more specific complaint. The court rejected the town's contention that the pleading was demurrable because a tax paid under a mistake of law was not recoverable as the precedent relied on arose under an earlier version of the statute. Under the law in effect, a party that sought a refund of taxes had only to show that the political subdivision was not legally entitled to the payment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court deemed the town's preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer to be a motion for a more specific complaint and then sustained the motion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant husband of rape.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband argued that he was entitled to proceed in forma pauperis, to have free counsel appointed, and to be transported at public expense. The husband further argued that the wife condoned his crime by having sexual relations with him after he had been charged. The court dismissed the exceptions as wholly without merit. The wife and a deputy clerk testified that the husband was convicted, that he was sentenced to imprisonment, and that he was serving his sentence. These facts amply supported a decree of divorce under the provisions of the Act. There was no right in a civil action to proceed in forma pauperis, to have free counsel appointed, or to be transported at public expense from a correctional institution to testify, particularly when the husband could have had no conceivable defense to the action. At the time of the husband and wife's alleged intercourse, the husband had merely been accused and was thus innocent until he was proven guilty. From the moment the husband was found guilty, he was in custody and had been since then. There was no intimation that any sexual relations occurred after the husband was convicted.</SPAN></P>

A Justice of the Peace (Pennsylvania) found defendants guilty. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a landowner and a coal mining company, had received authorization in the form of permits granted by the Sanitary Water Board and the Department of Mines and Mineral Industries of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to conduct stripping operations in the Borough. Defendants filed a petition for a special allowance to appeal their convictions. The court sustained the appeals and declared the ordinance invalid. The court held that the ordinance constituted a taking of property without due process of law and without compensation. Thus, the ordinance violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Coal was a natural resource capable of separate ownership from the surface, and it comprised the third estate in the land. The mining of coal was a lawful activity which, while subject to reasonable regulation, could not be prohibited. A statute forbidding the mining of coal under private dwellings, or in streets or cities, in places where the right to mine such coal was reserved in a grant, was unconstitutional as taking property without due process. Thus, the ordinance enacted by the Borough amounted to the taking of property without due process and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The garnishee filed a petition under Pa. R. Civ. 3121(a)(4) to stay execution by the creditor as to the proceeds of the policy on the basis that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 40, &sect; 534 made the policy exempt from garnishment. The creditor replied to the petition, contending that the proceeds of the policy were not exempt from execution and that &sect; 534 was otherwise unconstitutional. The court stayed execution, finding that under &sect; 534 the proceeds paid to the wife were exempt from garnishment to pay the debts of the husband and the wife. The court also ruled that &sect; 534 did not violate the creditor's right to equal protection because the classification imposed by the statute was founded upon a reasonable basis and that the creditor otherwise did not overcome its burden to show that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from a justice court (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of violating plaintiff town's zoning ordinance. It was shown that the owner violated Hickory Township, Pa., Ordinance of 1965, &sect; 47.22(c), which provided that the owner or lessee of an airport could have a maximum of one full-time employee live with his immediate family on the airport property to act as a guard or watchman.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was notified by letter that he violated the ordinance because he had a total of three families living on his airport property, one living in a house thereon and the other two in trailers, which had been moved onto the premises some time prior thereto. The airport manager and his family lived in one of the trailers; a portion of the house was used for general administration and control purposes and at the time of the notification of violation, two families, in addition to the airport manager and his family lived on the premises. Defendant contested the conviction on the ground that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court found that the house located on the premises and the two trailers in question were residential dwelling units as contemplated by the statute. Because of a mandate by an appellate court that the ordinance be liberally construed, it was not unconstitutional, but rather it was a reasonable regulation by which the government body was properly planning for the future, in the light of the conditions then existing. The municipality properly exercised its responsibility of ensuring that the land set aside for airport use was utilized to its fullest extent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed defendant's appeal.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 951 et seq., in that they refused to rent commercial housing to certain tenants because of their race.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission found that the landlords committed unlawful discriminatory practices in refusing to rent to certain tenants because of the tenants' race. The final order of the Commission directed the landlords to cease and desist from this unlawful discriminatory practice. The landlords appealed the order, arguing that notice was insufficient and that the Act was unconstitutional. The court disagreed, dismissed the appeal, and affirmed the Commission's adjudication. The court concluded that the landlords had adequate notice of the hearing before the Commission and filed prompt responses thereto. The court further concluded that the landlords were not denied the equal protection of the law and the due process of law because of the malapportionment of legislatures which passed the Act and the pertinent amendments thereto. Finally, the court held that the Act was a proper exercise of the police power to prohibit discrimination in leasing, selling, or financing of commercial housing against any person because of race, color, religious creed, ancestry, or national origin, and did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The author was the chairman of a historical society and had written a historical book. The book made reference to the daughter' s father, who was an industrialist. After reading a copy of the book, the daughter filed suit in equity to enjoin its sale and distribution. The daughter alleged that the statements contained in the book concerning her father were malicious and defamatory. The author claimed that the statement were true and not malicious and absent such maliciousness were privileged under the First Amendment. The author also argued that relief could not be granted because he neither published nor distributed the book but merely wrote it. The court dismissed the complaint, holding that the daughter was not entitled to injunctive relief because no substantial right of the daughter would be impaired and the remedy at law was not inadequate. There has been no wrong done by defendant and plaintiff has suffered no injury so there is nothing to redress in this case. Injunctive relief could not be applied in the case because the court lacked jurisdiction to order the publisher to cease publication and distribution because the publisher was not party to the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs claimed that they were aggrieved by an ordinance regulating mobile home parks. The court held that the ordinance was invalid because it was not properly adopted, as the ordinance was not properly recorded as required by The Second Class Township Code of May 1, 1933, as amended, the Act of June 6, 1963, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 65741. The court's conclusion was supported by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 67004. No seal was required. It was only when recording was accomplished through stapling or gluing that a seal was needed and then only for the purpose of preventing a substitution of pages. No signatures were required to be affixed to an ordinance upon its adoption because the minutes of the Township's supervisors were adequate evidence that the ordinance was voted upon and approved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer paid the taxes due under the Commonwealth's assessment of sales and use taxes on equipment and supplies used directly for its business. Approximately 14 months after the assessment, the taxpayer filed its petition for a refund for the taxes paid. The Commonwealth's Department of Revenue denied the refund on the grounds that the petition was untimely because it was not filed within six months of the assessment. On appeal, the court dismissed the appeal. The court held that the taxpayer's claim was untimely under &sect; 553(b) of the Pennsylvania Tax Act of May 29, 1963 for Education, P.L. 49, because it was not filed within six months of the assessment. The five-year statute of limitations in &sect; 553(d) of the Act did not apply because the taxpayer did not allege that in his case it was held that a prior interpretation affecting the taxpayer's liability was erroneous. The court concluded that the Act of August 23, 1961, P.L. 1092, did not authorize the taxpayer's petition for a refund without regard to the time limitations contained in &sect; 553 of the Tax Act of May 29, 1963 for Education.</SPAN></P>
