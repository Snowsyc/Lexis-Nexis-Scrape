</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a show cause order to determine why relator inmate, who filed a writ of habeas corpus, was under detention by respondent sheriff. The inmate was committed pursuant to a bench warrant after he was charged by an indictment for murder in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged that custody of his body was illegally obtained because Va. Code Ann. &sect; 53-303, under which his custody was obtained, was unconstitutional. He claimed that he had asylum in the State of Virginia and that his delivery to the custody of law-enforcement officials of New York State based on a certificate, but without the conduct of extradition proceedings or his waiver of them, was a violation of his rights under U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2(2), and 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3182. The court disagreed and found that custody was lawfully obtained. All of the statutory requirements under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 53-303 were met, and the statute was not declared to be unconstitutional. Thus, there was jurisdiction over the person of the inmate for the purpose of proceeding with a trial. The inmate's removal from the State of Virginia without extradition papers and without his waiver of extradition did not violate any of his constitutional rights or any rights under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3182.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

Extradition from one State to another need not be in accordance with the provisions of section 3182 which are not exclusive.  A State may enact legislation to supplement the Federal statute by permitting extradition in less exacting terms than those imposed by said statute.  Accordingly, the delivery of relator by the State of Virginia to the custody of respondent in the State of New York pursuant to the Virginia statute did not violate section 3182.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Regardless of how the personal presence of relator was obtained in Onondaga County, the jurisdiction over his person for the purpose of proceeding with this trial cannot now be questioned. </SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; I46-4.0, I46-6.0 illegal and unconstitutional insofar as they authorized the imposition of a real property transfer tax on the company as the grantee of the federal government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company had purchased property located in the city from the federal government, and the city sought to tax the property under the statutes in question. The city argued that the exemption of the federal government from taxation did not relieve the company, as the grantee of the federal government, from liability for the tax. The court found that: (1) under the Enabling Act, 1934 N.Y. Laws ch. 873, a transaction by or with the federal government was exempt from taxation; (2) the net effect of the Enabling Act's language was to render the section somewhat ambiguous, requiring construction against the taxing authority; and (3) the city code provision assessing the transfer tax on the grantee in a conveyance from the federal government was in contravention of the state's tax enabling legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of an order of the court, which had held that plaintiffs' note of issue was premature.</SPAN></P>

The court held that he note of issue was premature. Contending that the note of issue contained a statement claiming a preference as permitted by N.Y. App. Div. 2nd Dep't Special R. I(6), pt. 5, plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration. The court granted the motion for reconsideration and adhered to its original order. Finding that ordinarily, a note of issue might not be filed without a statement of readiness, the court held that the exceptions provided for by N.Y. App. Div. 2nd Dep't Special R. VI, pt. 7 and N.Y. App. Div. 2nd Dep't Special R. VIII, pt. 7 did not apply to the case before the court. The court held that the advantage provided by N.Y. App. Div. 2nd Dep't Special R.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The filing of a note of issue without a statement of readiness is premature despite the fact that plaintiff claimed a preference in the note of issue. Rule VIII of part 7 of the Rules of the Appellate Division, Second Department, permits an action to be placed on the calendar without a statement of readiness only if an &quot;application&quot; for a preference is simultaneously made.  The conclusion of prematurity is not in conflict with CPLR 3402 which allows the filing of a note of issue 40 days after service of the summons is complete.  CPLR 3401 authorizes the adoption of rules regulating the filing of notes of issue, and is consistent with the inherent power of the court to control its business.  Calendar control is exercised through rules which condition the filing of notes of issue on the performance by the parties of specified acts.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, property owners and a lessee, brought a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 against respondents, a city and others, seeking a judgment that Cortland, N.Y. Mun. Code 66-17 was unconstitutional or otherwise inapplicable to their property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners had improved their premises with a gasoline service station that had been in continuous operation for many years.

Petitioners filed an application for a reconstruction permit to construct a new station to replace the existing one, but the city denied the application, alleging that it was precluded by &sect; 66-17, which had been enacted after the erection of the station. Petitioners brought an Article 78 proceeding for a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional or did not apply to their property and for an order to issue them the permits. It sought a permanent injunction against enforcement of &sect; 66-17 against them. The court granted the injunction and directed the city to issue the permits. The ordinance required proposed amendments to be submitted to the Board of Appeals for prior report and recommendation, and that requirement was a condition precedent to action by the city's Common Council. The Council failed to conform with the requirements of its own legislation, so &sect; 66-17 was void.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought an order vacating a 1954 sentence against him as a third felony offender and directing a resentence. He alleged that a 1932 predicate judgment of conviction from Canada was invalid because he had not been represented by counsel and did not intelligently waive his right to counsel. The issue was whether the same remedy was available to attack a predicate judgment of conviction from a foreign country as one from another state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1964, the N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1943 was amended to provide for collateral attack of a predicate judgment of conviction from other states. This provided a remedy for defendants sentenced as multiple offenders where a prior conviction was shown to have been unconstitutionally obtained in another state. Defendant argued that this amendment should also apply to convictions from other countries and sought resentencing from a 1954 sentence which was based in part on a 1932 Canadian conviction. The court granted defendant the relief sought. A restrictive interpretation would have caused a denial of equal protection to certain defendants. The remedy of resentence found to exist with respect to prior sister state convictions also existed where the predicate judgment was alleged to have been obtained in the courts of a foreign country in violation of the rights of the person accused under the applicable constitutional provisions. Defendant was awarded a hearing to make his case that the Canadian conviction was obtained in violation of his constitutional rights, specifically the right to counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the remedy of resentence found to exist with respect to prior sister state convictions also existed relative to convictions obtained in the courts of a foreign country, allegedly in violation of defendant's constitutional rights.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The remedy of resentence under section 1943 of the Penal Law (as amd. by L. 1964, ch. 446), dealing with increased punishment for multiple felony offenders, existing with respect to prior sister State convictions, exists also with respect to predicate judgments alleged to have been obtained in the courts of a foreign country &quot;in violation of the rights of the person accused under the applicable provisions of the constitution of the United States&quot; (Penal Law, &sect; 1943).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An issue of fact exists as to whether defendant intelligently and deliberately waived his right to counsel upon arraignment and trial by a Police Magistrate in Ontario, Canada.

The court held that plaintiffs were deprived of their right to equal representation because the scheme of apportionment was unequal due to the fact that 7 councilmen represented less than 27 percent of the city population.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants' complaint had previously been dismissed because factual allegations in the complaint had not actually occurred. However, in support of their motion for reargument the applicants supplied a copy of a telegram issued by the liquor authority which then established that the liquor authority was acting upon its general policy to grant all liquor licenses. The court held that the telegram now established the happening of applicants' factual allegations in their complaint. Consequently, the court determined there was a valid basis for reconsideration of the earlier dismissal, and granted the applicants' motion to the extent of vacating the earlier dismissal for failure to state a cause of action. However, the court refused to grant the requested relief in the applicants' motion, a preliminary injunction, because only reconsideration of the motion to dismiss was before it, and not the merits of the underlying action. Furthermore, the issues needed more development in order for the court to rule on an injunction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- Railroad Full Crew Laws -- Full Crew Laws (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Railroad Law, &sect;&sect; 54</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">-a, 54-b, 54-c) are valid and constitutional exercise of police power for safety -- technological progress has changed &quot;firemen&quot; of steam locomotives into &quot;helpers&quot; of diesel engines, and has increased speed and length of freight trains, and has not substantially reduced safety functions of firemen, brakemen, conductors and engineers -- railroads have failed to prove that cost of compliance is unduly burdensome -- Full Crew Laws do not deprive railroads of property or equal protection or unduly burden interstate commerce -- Railway Labor Act (U.S. Code, tit. 45, &sect; 151 et seq.) and Public Law 88-108 of 1963 (77 U.S. Stat. 132) and Arbitration Board's award made thereunder, have not pre-empted field of railroad safety regulation and rendered our Full Crew Laws repugnant to Supremacy clause of United States Constitution (art. VI, cl. 2).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The so-called Full Crew Laws (Railroad Law, &sect;&sect; 54-a, 54-b, 54-c) were enacted in 1913, 1936 and 1937 under the police power of the State to promote safety in railroad operations.  They still validly and constitutionally prohibit (cf. U.S. Const., art. I, &sect;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  8, cl. 3; art. VI, cl. 2; 14th Amdt.; N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect;&sect; 6, 11) the operation in this State of any freight train of more than 25 cars unless manned by a crew of not less than one engineer, one fireman (this job is now often called helper), one conductor, and three brakemen; and of any train other than a freight train of 5 cars or more, unless manned by a crew of not less than one engineer, one fireman, one conductor, and two brakemen, and additionally a baggageman if it is a baggage train or passenger train carrying baggage; and of any freight train of 25 cars or less unless manned by a crew of not less than one engineer, one fireman, one conductor, and two brakemen; and of any light engine without cars unless it is manned by one engineer, one fireman, and one conductor or brakeman (Railroad Law, &sect; 54-a, enacted in 1913); and of any fuel-electric engine unless it is manned by a crew of not less than one engineer and one fireman or helper (Railroad Law, &sect; 54-b, enacted in 1936); and of any locomotive or motor or self-propelled unit to switch or transfer cars from one railroad or railroad yard to another, unless manned by a crew of not less than one engineer, one fireman or helper, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  one conductor or foreman, and two trainmen or two helpers (Railroad Law, &sect; 54-c, enacted in 1937).  This action by a number of railroads which are engaged in interstate commerce in New York State, seeking a judgment to declare said laws invalid and unconstitutional and to enjoin the New York State Attorney-General and the New York State Public Service Commission and a District Attorney from enforcing said laws, is dismissed after trial, and judgment is granted to said defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Technological progress since the enactment of the Full Crew Laws has lightened the work of the train crews and has eliminated many of the dangers which existed at that time; but that same progress has rendered engines and trains more speedy and more complicated than ever.  The 10 railroad plaintiffs in this case have not succeeded in proving that the dangers of operation which the Full Crew Laws sought to remedy have now lessened so much that those laws have become unreasonable, arbitrary, burdensome, and a confiscation or deprivation of the railroads' properties without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Modern diesel-electric and electric locomotives have altered &quot;firemen&quot; into &quot;helpers&quot; or &quot;firemen-helpers&quot;; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  but a modern freight train is often over a mile long, and the evidence establishes that the number of firemen-helpers and brakemen which was required by the Full Crew Laws is still required in order to perform substantial safety functions.  If the reasonableness of a statute is fairly debatable, the courts are precluded from overturning it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Greater flexibility in regulating train crew requirements could be attained if the subject matter were delegated to the Public Service Commission or some other regulatory agency; but that is for the Legislature to decide.  The Legislature chose to enact uniform requirements for all the railroads; and the railroads have not proved that that choice has been rendered arbitrary or capricious by modern circumstances.  Indeed, the railroads have failed to prove that their present-day costs of complying with those safety statutes have increased disproportionately over what those costs were when those statutes were enacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Sections 54-a and 54-c of the Railroad Law apply to &quot;any railroad of more than fifty miles in length within this state&quot;, while section 54-b applies to &quot;any railroad within this state&quot;; but it cannot be said that the legislative&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  police power has unreasonably singled out the railroads for safety regulation or has so unreasonably classified the railroads as to deny their constitutional right to the equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Our Full Crew Laws do not constitute a direct interference with or an undue burden upon interstate or foreign commerce; rather, they are designed to aid and protect those engaged in such commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Congress has not, by and under Public Law 88-108 of 1963 (77 U.S. Stat. 132), pre-empted the field of railroad safety regulation to such an extent as to render the full crew laws of the many States which have such laws repugnant to the &quot;Supremacy&quot; clause of the United States Constitution (art. VI, cl. 2).  Perhaps, as to other working conditions, the Railway Labor Act (U. S. Code, tit. 45, &sect; 151 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) has taken the field and has provided for regulation by collective bargaining agreements.  But the field has not been pre-empted as to State laws relating to minimum requirements of health or safety, even when applied to employees whose collective bargaining agreements are imbued with the force of Federal law by virtue of the Railway Labor Act. Congress has the power to preclude&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State regulation; but it has not done so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. United States Public Law 88-108 of 1963 (77 U.S. Stat. 132) was a joint resolution of Congress, approved by the President, and enacted in an emergency &quot;To provide for the settlement of the labor dispute between certain carriers by railroad and certain of their employees.&quot; It prohibited a then pending nationwide strike or lockout over pay and working conditions, and established an Arbitration Board under the Railway Labor Act, and empowered the board to make a binding award in the then pending disputes as to &quot;Use of Firemen (Helpers) on Other Than Steam Power&quot; and as to &quot;Consist of Road and Yard Crews&quot; and as to &quot;Minimum Safe Crew Consist&quot;, such award to continue in force for not more than two years, and all other issues to be decided by collective bargaining.  The board made such an award.  Pursuant to that award, the railroads are now operating locomotives without firemen in those States which have no full crew laws; and, pursuant to that award, special boards of adjustment have been appointed in some of those States and also in some of the States which do have full crew laws; and some of those boards have approved changes in work rules&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  so as to permit smaller crews. The Congressional joint resolution and committee reports and the award and reports of the Arbitration Board indicate that there was no intent to supersede State full crew laws, but that, on the contrary, it was intended that the disputes as to crew requirements be settled by collective bargaining agreements.  It is quite feasible for the railroads to comply both with New York State's Full Crew Laws and with the permissive provisions of the Federal Arbitration Board's award.  In this situation, it cannot be said that Congress, under the &quot;Supremacy&quot; clause (U. S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2), has invalidated our Full Crew Laws.  </SPAN></P>

In addition, the Law was reasonably adapted to determine whether unjustifiable prices were being charged to a state consumer and whether price competition was prevailing in the industry.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the liquor sellers' application for a preliminary injunction enjoining the liquor authority from enforcing the law and instead directed judgment for the liquor authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Intoxicating liquors -- price competition -- sections 7 and 9 of chapter 531 of Laws of 1964 amending Alcoholic Beverage Control Law to provide for price competition in sales of liquor are constitutional -- economic hardships resulting from enactment do not affect constitutionality -- requirement that price schedules be filed is not unreasonable -- any vagueness in terms can be cured by rules of State Liquor Authority -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> not invalid as inconsistent with purpose to promote temperance -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> does not contravene interstate commerce clause -- classification in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is reasonable -- requirement of schedules irrespective of place of sale does not interfere with commerce -- requiring bottle and case price is given effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Sections 7 and 9 of chapter 531 of the Laws of 1964 amended the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law to provide for the filing, by brand owners, distillers or manufacturers of alcoholic beverages, monthly, schedules of prices of cases and bottles and discounts to retailers and an affirmation by the brand owner that the price to wholesalers in the schedule is no higher than the lowest&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  price at which such item was sold to any wholesaler anywhere in the United States.  The purpose was to foster price competition in the manufacture, sale and distribution of liquor and to result in lower prices to New York consumers. In this action for judgment declaring such sections unconstitutional, defendants are granted summary judgment declaring such sections valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The strongest presumption of validity attaches to chapter 531 of the Laws of 1964 because it is an enactment under the police power, and the fact that it causes or might cause an economic hardship upon those whom it affects is no argument against its constitutionality.  That economic hardship, possible reduced profit margins, difficulty in increasing prices and in competing in other States result or that expenditures for new equipment must be made does not bear on the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The provisions of chapter 531 which require the filing of price schedules and affirmations are neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.  That plaintiffs might find it difficult to obtain the required information or are limited by the act in the price differentials allowed does not make the act arbitrary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The claimed vagueness of terms such as &quot;related person&quot; and &quot;inducements of any kind whatever&quot; contained in the amendments to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law can be cured under the power given to defendants to make rules.  This delegation of power relates to the execution of the law and is valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The statute is not invalid on the ground that it is inconsistent with the declared policy of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law to promote temperance or that it will not serve to cure the monopolistic and anticompetitive practices at which it is directed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The regulation and control of the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages is a matter of local concern and the mere fact that such regulations have or may have some repercussions upon the activities of a business which operates Nationwide does not invalidate the State action, particularly where the subject of the action is within the police power of the State.  Since the purpose of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law is to regulate and control the intrastate sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages, it does not contravene the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution or the Sherman Antitrust Act or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Robinson-Patman Antidiscrimination Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The allegation in the complaint that section 9 violates the Constitution by discriminatingly imposing maximum price limitations upon sales made by persons dealing in liquor sold under &quot;private labels&quot; and sales made by vintners and wholesalers of wine is rejected.  A different classification for brand owners, private brands and vintners was found by the Legislature to exist.  The section is valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The statute, by requiring schedules for sales irrespective of the place of sale or delivery does not thereby interfere with interstate commerce, because the purpose of the statute is to regulate &quot;within the state&quot; ( Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, &sect; 101-b, subd. 1) and because sales outside the State can be made with the permission of defendants (&sect; 101-b, subd. 3, par. [a]).  The requirement that a licensee obtain prior permission is not such a burden on interstate commerce as to make it invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Requiring &quot;net bottle and case price paid by the seller&quot; has value in determining whether the fundamental principles of price competition prevail in the industry and in determining whether unjustifiable prices are being charged to consumers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the State and must be given effect.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suit was based on a claim that the challenged apportionment did not comply with the so-called &quot;one person, one vote&quot; principle and violated equal protection. The court was also asked to declare N.Y. County Law &sect; 150&nbsp;unconstitutional. Plaintiffs and the Board questioned the constitutional validity of the split referendum provisions of the Municipal Home Rule Law. The court found that N.Y. Const. art. II, &sect; 5 and the 1911 N.Y. Laws 773 did not apply. But it concluded that the apportionment scheme of the Board was unconstitutional in that it violated both the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the N.Y. Const. art.

The &quot;one person, one vote&quot; principle was held to apply to County Board of Supervisors' elections. The present apportionment violated equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that within two months of said arrest, he was twice arrested and charged with the same offense. He further alleged that both charges were subsequently dismissed, that he had been subjected to three arrests and prosecutions under the vagrancy law within three successive months and had been put to considerable expense each time in raising bail and for counsel fees, and had been subjected to unnecessary imprisonment including light confinement while awaiting arraignment. Defendant contended that &sect; 887(1) offended U.S. Const. amends. XIII, XIV. The court concluded that defendant failed to show that he had a clear right to the relief sought. The court determined that a man's mere property status, without more, could not be used by a state to test, qualify, or limit his rights as a citizen of the United States. The court explained that the statute was aimed at a lazy person, who hung around the streets and public places without employment when he could obtain something to do. The court concluded that the statute did not limit a person's rights merely on the basis of his property status or on the basis of mere unemployment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates brought an action against respondents in federal court claiming they had been subjected to religious persecution and discrimination while incarcerated. The federal court held that the initial balancing of rights had to be determined by the state court. The inmates brought a motion for partial summary judgment and the court granted the motion. The court found that in refusing to recognize the Black Muslim group as a &quot;religion,&quot; the Commissioner assumed powers beyond the scope of his legislative authority and denied free exercise of religion and equal protection of the law guaranteed by the Constitution. The court determined that the Commissioner's rules were drafted on the unconstitutional assumption that he could determine that the Muslims were a &quot;sham&quot; and not entitled to any religious exercises. The court found that the Commissioner could not fix arbitrary standards for clergymen who sought to visit inmates. The court ordered the Commissioner to revise the regulations and stated that he could put restrictions on the time, place, and conditions members of all sects could hold congregational meetings, but could not deny inmates their free exercise of religion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In refusing to recognize the religion of Islam as practiced by a sect known as Black Muslims and headed by Elijah Muhammed, the Commissioner of Correction has assumed powers beyond the scope of his legislative authority, has contradicted an affirmed finding by a Federal court that it is a religion and has denied to prisoners, who profess that faith, the free exercise of religion and equal protection of the law guaranteed by the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In adopting regulations and a statement of policy, the Commissioner assumed unconstitutionally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that such religion is a sham and its members not entitled to exercise any religious exercises.  Such regulations prevent members from obtaining spiritual advice and ministration from ministers of their own faith and from conducting the religious exercises described in their petitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Freedom to select the clergy and to determine the qualifications of ministers and chaplains is an essential part of the free exercise of religion entitled to Federal constitutional protection against State interference.  There is no authority in the Commissioner to fix arbitrary standards for clergymen who seek to visit inmates in State prisons and provide religious guidance to them.  The Legislature has never defined &quot;clergymen&quot; to require State certification of them.  Regulations of the Commissioner restricting the giving of spiritual advice to a &quot;qualified&quot; clergyman of an &quot;approved&quot; faith permit exclusion of all Black Muslim inmates from the exercise of every religious service and infringe on petitioners' constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The issuance of new liquor licenses did not constitute an illegal taking of property. The liquor licensees did not have a constitutional right to limited competition.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The provision in the Reapportionment Compliance Act (L. 1964, ch. 976) for a State Assembly of 165 members (and alternative reapportionment plans [L. 1964, chs. 977, 979, 981] for, respectively, 180, 186 and 174 Assemblymen, held by the U. S. Dist. Ct. [S. D. N. Y.] to be unconstitutional in view of U. S. Const., 14th Amdt.) disregarded the constitutional mandate for an Assembly of 150 members (N. Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 2) and was invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. New York State's &quot;scheme&quot; of legislative apportionment (N. Y. Const., art. III) which the United States Supreme Court's decision ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">WMCA </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Lomenzo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 377 U.S. 633) invalidated as violating the equal protection clause (U. S. Const., 14th Amdt., &sect; 1) was composed only of the formulae found in sections 4 and 5 of article III of the State Constitution and the statutes found in article 8 of the State Law -- and no more.  There was nothing inherent in the invalidation of the &quot;scheme&quot; which would require that the provision (art. III, &sect;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2), dictating the size of the Assembly, be likewise considered invalid. On the contrary, the United States Supreme Court held ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Reynolds </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Sims</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 377 U.S. 533) that State constitutional provisions should be deemed violative of the Federal Constitution only when validly asserted constitutional rights could not otherwise be protected and effectuated; that courts should attempt to accommodate the relief ordered to the apportionment provisions of State constitutions insofar as possible; that determining the size of its legislative bodies is a matter within the discretion of each individual State, and that its opinion should not be read as indicating that there are any Federal constitutional maximums or minimums on the size of State legislative bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The constitutional provision for 150 Assemblymen (proposed by the Constitutional Convention of 1894) cannot be held, upon any principles of constitutional history including a review of the 1894 Convention Record, to be so inextricably interwoven with the apportionment scheme, also proposed by that convention and presently held invalid by the Federal courts, that such requirement of a 150-member Assembly must also necessarily fall. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  4. The legislative increase in Assembly seats cannot be based upon the so-called &quot;historic constitutional policy&quot; of giving each county at least one Assembly seat (N. Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 5) inasmuch as such policy was not observed in the increase from 150 to 165 Assemblymen in the Reapportionment Compliance Act itself.  Moreover, the disparate loudness of the voice of the smaller counties appears to be exactly what the United States Supreme Court held to be condemned by the Federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The conclusion that the Legislature was without power to increase the size of the Assembly does not mean that the number can never be changed.  Previous uniform practice has been to embody such change in a new Constitution or a constitutional amendment to be adopted by vote of the people.  The specification of the number of Assemblymen was placed in the State Constitution by the people and it should not be changed except by appropriate constitutional amendment voted upon by the people.  Only this method is available on this aspect of the case and, unless and until it is utilized, the size of the Assembly as set out (art. III, &sect; 2) must stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The constitutional provision that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reapportionment and redistricting of Senate and Assembly should be &quot;by the same law&quot; (art. III, &sect; 5) forbade a severance of the Houses of the Legislature for such purposes.  The two are inseparable and if one falls for invalidity the other must fall with it.  Consequently, although the &quot;separability&quot; provision in the Reapportionment Compliance Act (&sect; 401) does not purport to save the statute as to one House when the act as to the other is held void, even if it undertook to do so, the Constitution takes precedence and governs.  Accordingly, the 1964 apportionment statutes are void as to Senate reapportionment and redistricting as well as to that of the Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The Reapportionment Compliance Act was not rendered unconstitutional by virtue of its having been enacted at an Extraordinary or Special Session of the Legislature, rather than at a &quot;regular session&quot; thereof.  Constitutional provisions (art. III, &sect;&sect; 4, 5) for apportionment at a &quot;regular session&quot; have been interpreted as merely defining the time when the Legislature is first empowered to alter districts for legislative representation, rather than as qualifying the character of the session at which the apportionment can&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be enacted, and a careful study of subsequent relevant amendments and proposed amendments to the Constitution requires the same interpretation today.  Moreover, the statement of the Federal District Court that its order, issued in compliance with the United States Supreme Court's decision, had given the Legislature sufficient time to reapportion &quot;during the regular session&quot; cannot be relied on to support any inference that such reapportionment must as matter of law be enacted at a regular session, especially since the District Court pointed out that it was not passing upon claims under the State Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Jurisdiction of the New York Supreme Court over the person of the respondents and the subject matter of the proceeding is well established by virtue of the State Constitution (art. III, &sect; 5) making apportionment subject to review by the Supreme Court at the suit of any citizen; by the applicable State statutes (L. 1911, ch. 773) enacted pursuant thereto and in furtherance thereof, and by the refusal of the United States courts to pass upon the validity of the Reapportionment Compliance Act under the State Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The situation created by or resulting from the decisions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the United States courts, requiring the enactment of reapportionment legislation, was not such emergency as to have compelled abandonment of all provisions of article III of the State Constitution.  The emergency envisaged by constitutional provision (art. III, &sect; 25) empowering the Legislature to provide for emergency governmental operation and succession to public office in cases of enemy attack or natural disaster, must be more dire and critical than the basis here presented as justification for the Legislature's action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The antigerrymandering provisions of the State Constitution forbidding division of counties and towns into legislative districts, with stated exceptions, and requiring continuity, convenience and compact form for districts (art. III, &sect;&sect; 4, 5) survived the condemnation of the United States Supreme Court's ruling in support of the &quot;one-man, one-vote&quot; principle.  The New York Supreme Court was authorized under both Federal and State Constitutions to receive and consider proffered evidence of alleged gerrymandering. Several isolated but significant factors support allegations that open partisan gerrymandering was a fundamental purpose and accomplished fact&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the apportionment statutes enacted in December, 1964.  Figures and analyses presented established prima facie cases of gerrymandering. However, they cannot, in view of the respondents' denial and defenses, warrant any disposition as a matter of law. A hearing must be held to resolve the factual issues raised.  However, inasmuch as the statute has been held invalid, such hearing need not be held until the United States Supreme Court and the New York State Court of Appeals determine appeals already pending or to be taken concerning the constitutionality of the reapportionment legislation.  </SPAN></P>

At the hearing on the motion to suppress the arresting officer testified that at approximately 3:00 a.m. he observed defendant and another man on a street corner. As he approached, the other man ran away and that was what attracted his attention to defendant. The officer testified that as he approached, defendant put his hand under the glove he was wearing on his left hand, or up his sleeve. The officer testified that defendant's hand movements made him apprehensive. A search revealed a number of marijuana cigarettes. The court denied the motion finding that the officer had probable cause to stop and frisk defendant because the time of the incident, coupled with the other man's sudden departure and defendant's furtive movements warranted the officer in reasonably suspecting that defendant was committing, had committed, or was about to commit a crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An ex-wife brought an action against her ex-husband and his second spouse. The ex-wife sought to have declared invalid the judgment of a Mexican court divorcing the ex-spouses, and she also sought to have declared invalid the ex-husband's second marriage. The ex-husband and his second spouse moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the court had not acquired jurisdiction. The court found that personal service on the ex-husband was properly made pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 232, 235. The court also found that service by publication on the second spouse was proper under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 314. The court concluded that an action to alter or affect matrimonial status was a proceeding in rem where substituted service by publication or in any other authorized form was sufficient notice to answer the requirement of due process. The court held that service on both the ex-husband and the second spouse was proper as to that part of the complaint seeking judgment declaring the Mexican divorce invalid. The court found no requirement that the child of the ex-husband and the second spouse be made a party to the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation manufactured a part which the buyer purchased and included in its manufacture of chairs. An individual filed an action against the buyer claiming that the chair caused his injuries. The buyer filed a third-party complaint against the corporation. The corporation claimed that the buyer could not maintain an action against it in a New York court because the corporation did not have contacts in the State of New York. The court denied the corporation's motion to dismiss, holding that the nondomiciliary corporation was amenable to the personal jurisdiction of the New York courts under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 302(a)(2). The court found that the corporation could have reasonably anticipated that its product would be sold in New York as a substantial part of another product. The court noted that it was uncontroverted that the corporation knew that the part it manufactured was being made a part of a chair that was sold throughout the country, including in New York. The court concluded that the requirements of &sect; 302(a)(2) were constitutional under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. The court found that New York was the most convenient forum for the trial.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the state filed a motion for a special jury to try the case. Defendant opposed the motion on the ground that the affidavit merely set forth the usual form averments on such an application. Defendant further opposed the motion, citing the Recommendation and Survey Relating to the Abolition of Special Juries contained in the Eighteenth Annual Report of the New York Judicial Council (1952). He argued that the survey showing imbalances as to occupations, educational qualifications, and sex between the special and general jury panels should now, in view of the more liberal and progressive reasoning evidenced in recent decisions, lead to the conclusion that the operation of the special jury system would deprive him of due process. The court granted the state's motion for a special jury, by holding that although, if again presented with this issue, the Supreme Court might hold that a special jury would deny due process, the court could not so hold because it was bound by the previous determinations of the Supreme Court in the absence of proof which would support a contrary conclusion.</SPAN></P>

The case went before the court on defendants' motions to suppress, which the court granted. The court held that a court order issued under &sect; 813-a could not serve as a &quot;search warrant&quot; under the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment to validate an intrusion or invasion into a constitutionally protected area. A &quot;search warrant&quot; may not constitutionally authorize a search for or seizure of mere evidence in the nature of conversations or verbal statements. Only such eavesdropping that violated the Fourth Amendment was determined to be unconstitutional.

Pro., &sect; 813-a) cannot constitutionally be used as warrant to intrude upon person's business premises and search for and seize conversations (U. S. Const., 4th and 5th Amdts.); nor can such inadmissible conversations constitute probable cause for issuance of search warrant pursuant to which pistols were seized as physical evidence (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 792); such conversations and such physical evidence are ordered suppressed (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 813-c); since there was no other evidence before Grand Jury, indictment is ordered dismissed -- United States Supreme Court decisions govern -- to extent to which sections 792 and 813-a of Code of Criminal Procedure authorize seizure of &quot;property constituting evidence of crime&quot; and of conversations as &quot;evidence of crime&quot; only, they violate Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments -- court has power to hold pretrial hearing and order suppression of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutionally</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> seized evidence; thus, District Attorney has right of appeal which he would not have if court made</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> these rulings at trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The United States Constitution (4th Amdt.) provides that &quot;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause&quot;.  A person's place of business is such a constitutionally protected area.  The police may obtain an ex parte order (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 813-a) authorizing them to install an electronic eavesdropping device; but when, in order to install and conceal such a device, they break and enter or physically intrude or trespass on constitutionally protected premises, they have made an unreasonable, unlawful and unconstitutional search.  Any evidence thus obtained is inadmissible and should be suppressed (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 813-c).  When the police obtain a search warrant (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 792) based upon such inadmissible evidence, no probable cause is established for the issuance of the warrant, and hence the physical evidence which is seized pursuant to such a warrant must likewise be suppressed (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 813-c).  Furthermore, if a Grand Jury has issued an indictment based solely on such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  inadmissible evidence, both physical and intangible, the indictment should be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The New York State Constitution (art. I, &sect; 12) contains the same provision as does the Federal Fourth Amendment. However, the constitutional principle which excludes unlawfully seized evidence is commanded upon the States by the Federal Fourth Amendment via the Fourteenth Amendment.  Therefore, the Federal standards stated by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court should determine the constitutionality of State legislation which authorizes eavesdropping or wire tapping, such as section 813-a of our Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that &quot;An ex parte order for eavesdropping&quot; -- which is otherwise prohibited by the Penal Law ( &sect; 738) -- &quot;may be issued * * * upon oath or affirmation * * * that there is reasonable ground to believe that evidence of crime may be thus obtained&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A grand larceny of jewelry by false pretenses having been committed, the police made affidavit showing that there was reasonable ground to believe that one Scandifia was implicated in that crime, and obtained an ex parte order authorizing them to install an electronic eavesdropping device (Code Crim. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pro., &sect; 813-a) in a service station owned by Scandifia.  They installed the device by breaking and illegally entering the service station in the early morning hours.  At two-month intervals they obtained orders extending the original order's duration (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 813-a; cf. Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 802).  Meantime, they obtained a similar ex parte order authorizing electronic eavesdropping of the business premises of one Ferrara; and there too they surreptitiously installed a device by physically intruding upon Ferrara's constitutionally protected premises.  This order was based on an affidavit alleging conspiracy and coercion and &quot;shylocking&quot;, but not showing probable cause. By means of these electronic devices, the police listened to all conversations, not only telephonic ones.  Apparently they heard nothing relating to those crimes.  What they eventually did hear, on the Scandifia eavesdrop device, were conversations between Scandifia and one Grossman indicating their unlawful possession of two pistols and bullets and a conspiracy among those two and Ferrara and one Pistone to assault or kill any and all stool pigeons.  A police officer presented an affidavit as to these inadmissible&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conversations and obtained a warrant to search an automobile owned by Grossman (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 792).  The warrant was executed and disclosed two pistols. On motions of defendants and after a hearing thereon, the seized pistols and the overheard conversations are ordered suppressed (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 813-c); and, since there was no other evidence before the Grand Jury, the indictment which charges all of the defendants with conspiracy to commit assault or murder and which further charges defendants Grossman and Scandifia with illegal possession of weapons, is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Ex parte orders authorizing eavesdropping (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 813-a) cannot be used as &quot;Warrants&quot;, under the Fourth Amendment of the United Statse Constitution, so as to authorize a physical intrusion or invasion into constitutionally protected premises in order to search for and seize evidence consisting of verbal statements or conversations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Furthermore, the overheard conversations concerned, not a jewelry larceny as set forth in the supporting affidavit, but pistols and bullets and a conspiracy to assault or kill any and all stool pigeons.  It cannot be said that, as to such unrelated crimes, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  eavesdropping order or the extensions of that order were based on &quot;reasonable ground&quot; (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 813-a) or &quot;probable cause&quot; (U. S. Const., 4th Amdt.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Moreover, the United States Constitution (4th Amdt.) prohibits any search warrants except those &quot;particularly describing the * * * things to be seized.&quot; The things to be seized in this case were conversations evidencing particular crimes; yet the order necessarily authorized electronic listening to &quot;any and all conversations, communications and discussions&quot;.  It seems that no electronic listening or recording device has yet been invented which will shut itself off when a privileged or merely social conversation begins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Section 792 of the Code of Criminal Procedure authorizes search warrants for the seizure not only of (a) the fruits of a crime and (b) instrumentalities used in committing a crime and (c) contraband unlawfully possessed, but (d) &quot;property constituting evidence of crime&quot;; and section 813-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure authorizes orders for overhearing and recording conversations from which &quot;evidence of crime&quot; may be obtained.  To the extent that the quoted words may be taken to authorize the search&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and seizure of tangible property on the sole ground that it is evidence of guilt, and of intangibles which are mere conversations or verbal statements, said sections 792 and 813-a violate constitutional protections against privacy and self incrimination (U. S. Const., 4th and 5th Amdts.), and perhaps also the protection which due process of law affords (U. S. Const., 14th Amdt.) against involuntary confessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The court has power under sections 813-c, 813-d, and 813-e of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and under its inherent powers as well, to entertain a pretrial motion and hold a hearing and suppress intangible evidence which has been unconstitutionally seized under cover of an order made under section 813-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  By adopting this pretrial procedure, the court affords the District Attorney a right of appeal which he would not have if the court were to make these rulings at the trial.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers sought a permanent injunction against defendant city's implementation of New York City, N.Y., Health Code &sect; 141.08, which provided for the fluoridation of the city's water supply. The city sought dismissal of the taxpayers' complaint, which alleged that the city could not legally expend the funds for &sect; 141.08 because it violated the Fourteenth Amendment, N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, and the New York City Public Health Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purpose of New York City, N.Y., Health Code &sect; 141.08 was to prevent tooth decay in children. The court held that the New York City Department of Health was empowered by New York City, N.Y., Charter &sect;&sect; 555 - 558 to enact statutes for the furtherance and protection of human health. Section 141.08 offended no state public policy, contravened no state statute or municipal ordinance, and was not in excess of the Department's power. Section 141.08 did not violate New York City, N.Y., Charter &sect; 225 because the city was not issuing bonds for the financing of the fluoridation. The city was not required to prove that fluoridation of the water supply was the most efficacious manner of distribution of the fluoride to children. Fluoridation did not breach the Equal Protection Clause by discrimination in favor of children because the children would be adults one day. The health of children was a legitimate area of public and governmental concern and New York City, N.Y., Health Code &sect; 141.08 was an appropriate exercise of the city's police power. The court relied on other case law regarding fluoridation statutes in its dismissal of the taxpayers' action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the taxpayers' motion for a temporary injunction and granted the city's cross motion to dismiss the taxpayer's complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- fluoridation of water -- in action to enjoin New York City's proposed water fluoridation program, complaint is dismissed -- fluoridation is health problem within jurisdiction of Board of Health -- such board's enactment of section 141.08 of New York City Health Code, authorizing program, is valid -- expenditure of funds from expense budget for such program is valid -- issue of impairment of religious freedom of group by program not considered since not raised in complaint -- means here used to provide fluorides by adding fluorides to water is valid -- fluoridation not discriminatory in favor of children -- no rights of citizens invaded by fluoridation -- courts will not interfere with establishment of fluoridation program; question is for legislative and executive branches of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action to enjoin the proposed program for the fluoridation of the municipal water supply of New York City as authorized by section 141.08 of the New York City Health Code enacted by the Board of Health, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plaintiffs' motion for a temporary injunction is denied and defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint is granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Regardless of its validity, the fluoridation program is directed towards the security of life and health of the citizens of New York City and towards coping with the public health problem of tooth decay and dental neglect, particularly among children.  Even though there is a strong difference of opinion as to its value, the problem is one of health and is within the jurisdiction of the Department of Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 141.08 of the Health Code is not against public policy, contravenes no State statute or municipal ordinance and is not in excess of the Health Department's power.  A cause of action wherein plaintiffs allege that the city may not lawfully expend funds for the proposed project because no local law has been passed authorizing such action is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The expenditure of funds from the expense budget for the acquisition and installation of the necessary equipment and facilities is proper.  A project need not be handled through the capital budget and capital budget appropriation if it is intended that the costs of the project be met wholly out of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  expense budget appropriation and not by any city borrowing. While allowance of capital expenditures through the device of inclusion in the expense budget may afford a method of circumvention of the procedures surrounding capital budget appropriations, this procedure is legally permissible and there is no basis presented for judicial interference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Since there is no allegation in the complaint that the religious freedom of certain groups in the community will be unconstitutionally impaired by fluoridation, the issue cannot be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The existence of other methods by which fluorides may be provided is irrelevant.  The means used here of adding it to the water supply is lawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Fluoridation does not discriminate because only children benefit.  Children become adults and fluoridation will ultimately affect all.  The health of children is a legitimate area of public and governmental concern, whether under the police power of the State or in the exercise of the State's power to protect the general welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Fluoridation does not unconstitutionally invade the rights of citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Until scientific evidence as to harmful effects of fluoridation exceeds the speculation, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  now existing, courts will not interfere and the controversy should remain with the legislative and executive branches of government. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff criminal defendant filed an action against defendant city, alleging false arrest and imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and conspiracy arising from his detention at a police station and extended interrogation without the ability to communicate with his family, friends, or attorney. The interrogation resulted in a confession, and criminal defendant was convicted. Criminal defendant filed a summary judgment motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A victim was shot during a holdup, but described assailants before his death. This information and other leads brought police to criminal defendant, who was brought in for questioning. After 27 hours of withheld contact from his family, friends, and attorney, criminal defendant confessed. He was then arrested and convicted solely on the basis of his confession. However, criminal defendant's conviction was vacated because of constitutional infirmities in the questioning and arrest of criminal defendant. Criminal's complaint alleged false arrest and imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and conspiracy, upon which he filed a summary judgment motion. Because of the manner of the investigation, questioning, and detention, the police lacked probable cause to believe that criminal defendant had committed a felony. Thus, city had no right to detain or arrest criminal defendant. Despite this, the court allowed the false arrest claim to go to the jury. The court also held that the false imprisonment claim did not sufficiently state a cause of action and that the issue of whether &quot;malice&quot; occurred to prove malicious prosecution was a question for the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied criminal defendant's summary judgment motion, dismissed certain causes of action, and issued conclusions of law as to other causes of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">False imprisonment -- lack of probable cause -- in action for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution, where no issue of fact exists, issue of probable cause may be determined by court as question of law -- police officer lacked probable cause to believe that plaintiff committed murder -- even if probable cause existed, plaintiff's arrest was unlawful ab initio; plaintiff granted summary judgment in action for false imprisonment but damages will be determined by triers of fact -- defendant prevented plaintiff from complying with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> dealing with notice of claim -- moreover, notice of claim is timely where filed after indictment dismissed in 1963; issue of timeliness left to trial court -- plaintiff not entitled to recovery for imprisonment after judgment of conviction -- presumption of probable cause was overcome by use of void confession against plaintiff -- question of malice in action for malicious prosecution is left to jury -- cause of action for conspiracy adds nothing to primary torts alleged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action to recover damages for false arrest and imprisonment and for malicious prosecution, where there is no dispute as to the facts, and no conflicting inferences&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  may fairly be drawn from the circumstances, the issue of probable cause may be disposed of by the court as a question of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The undisputed facts show no circumstances which warranted the apprehension, detention and arrest of plaintiff in 1941.  Nowhere does it appear that plaintiff, and two others, resembled the persons described by a murder victim to a police officer before the victim's death, or that the victim did or could see the getaway car and its driver parked, according to a witness for the Grand Jury, some 10 feet in front of the victim's car at a time when darkness had set in.  Accordingly, the police officer, as a matter of law, lacked probable cause to believe that plaintiff had committed a felony and therefore had no right to arrest plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Even assuming that probable cause existed, the violation by defendant's officers of section 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by failing to take plaintiff before a Magistrate for arraignment without unnecessary delay, rendered the arrest unlawful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ab initio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and it continued to be unlawful until plaintiff was lawfully committed pursuant to a warrant.  While plaintiff was arraigned shortly after he was formally arrested&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and booked, his detention in the precinct house for more than 33 hours prior to the formal arrest constituted an unlawful detention. Detention in a police station constitutes an arrest. Plaintiff was in fact under arrest for all of the time he was interrogated and subjected to the coercion applied to compel his confession. This arrest and detention became unlawful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ab initio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and plaintiff is entitled to damages from the commencement of his detention until the time of his arraignment 40 hours later.  Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on the first cause of action but, since the damages sustained for the 40-hour period are relatively minimal compared to the 22-year period involved, an assessment of such damages should not be had but it should be determined by the triers of the facts of the remaining issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiff's noncompliance with the statutory provisions relative to the service of a notice of claim and the commencement of the action was caused by defendant's conduct in unlawfully placing plaintiff under restraint and therefore defendant cannot complain of plaintiff's failure to file a notice of claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Moreover, a cause of action for false imprisonment does&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not accrue until the party has been discharged from restraint.  The indictment against plaintiff was not dismissed until 1963.  Therefore the provisions of the statute were complied with.  Since, however, there may be an arguable question of law that the false imprisonment was complete when the arraignment took place, and that the cause of action accrued at that time, the issue is referred to the trial court for determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. As a matter of law, plaintiff is not entitled to any recovery for the imprisonment subsequent to the judgment of conviction. Such detention pursuant to a judgment, regular on its face, is not actionable even if the judgment is thereafter set aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Any presumption of probable cause relating to the prosecution was overcome as a matter of law by proof that defendant's employees caused to be exhibited to the Grand Jury and the trial jury the void confession which was the sole proximate cause of plaintiff's indictment and conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. As to the cause of action for malicious prosecution, malice may be inferred by the trier of the facts from the circumstance that there was a lack of probable cause for the institution of the criminal proceedings, but such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  inference may not be drawn by the court, nor can the trial court direct a jury to draw such an inference.  The jury may presume malice but it is not required to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. A third cause of action charging a conspiracy adds nothing substantively to the primary torts alleged.  In a civil action for conspiracy, the tort is the illicit acts and not the agreement.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff City of Mount Vernon sought to enjoin defendant East Hudson Parkway Authority (authority) from appropriating certain property belonging to the city and others for the purpose of widening a roadway. Prior to service of its answer, the authority filed a motion to dismiss, alleging lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction, lack of the city's capacity to sue, and failure to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 457, the authority allocated funds for the acquisition of the city's property and the expansion of a state parkway. The city sought to enjoin the act, and the authority entered a motion to dismiss. Under N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 3211(c), the court treated the motion like a summary judgment motion and considered the parties' supporting affidavits. The court granted the motion and dismissed the case. The court held that the authority was empowered, under N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 457(4), to acquire property in the way it did, and that the statute enjoyed a presumption of constitutionality that the city's pleadings, which attacked its reasonableness, could not overcome. The court held that the question of necessity in eminent domain cases was within the legislative discretion and not a proper subject for judicial review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After considering supporting affidavits, the court granted the authority's motion to dismiss because the city's complaint was legally insufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent domain -- East Hudson Parkway Authority -- although consent of municipality is required if East Hudson Parkway Authority appropriates municipality's street or property (Public Authorities Law, &sect; 457, subd. 3), no such consent is needed if State Superintendent of Public Works makes such appropriation for said Authority (Public Authorities Law, &sect; 457, subd. 4) -- whether eight-lane widening will not be needed until year 1985, and whether six-lane widening would be enough and would not interfere with city's urban renewal plans, are matters within power and discretion of appropriating authorities, not courts -- city's complaint dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The East Hudson Parkway Authority was created in 1960 (Public Authorities Law, &sect; 450 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.), to operate and reconstruct the Westchester County parkway system, which includes the Cross County Parkway. At first, its power of condemnation was subject to the proviso that it could not condemn property of a municipality without such municipality's consent (Public Authorities Law, &sect; 457, subd. 3).  However, the Legislature amended this section by adding a subdivision 4 in 1962 and by amending said subdivision 4 further in 1963, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  so as to provide a simpler and more expeditious procedure whereby the State Superintendent of Public Works, when requested by the Authority, may appropriate property for it by the procedure used under the Highway Law ( &sect; 30).  There are similar procedures for the Thruway and for interstate routes and for others (e.g., Public Authorities Law, &sect;&sect; 358, 529, 1007; Highway Law, &sect; 340-b).  The procedure under subdivision 4 of section 457 of the Public Authorities Law is obviously an alternative to that under subdivision 3 and eliminates any need for municipal consent.  Subdivision 4 is constitutional and valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The City of Mount Vernon sues to enjoin and restrain an appropriation which will widen, from four lanes to eight lanes, five miles of the Cross County Parkway, of which one mile lies in said city.  The city urges that six lanes would be enough and would eliminate the need to appropriate a certain city street and certain private property, that the eight-lane taking will interfere with the city's master plan for urban renewal, and that there is no need for an eight-lane highway except as projected into the year 1985.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town filed a motion for summary judgment in its action against defendant property owners. The town sought to enjoin the owners from maintaining and/or occupying a trailer on their land in violation of its ordinance that required a building permit or a certificate of occupancy. Further, the owners' land was not zoned for the erection or occupancy of trailers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners alleged that the town's zoning ordinances were unconstitutional, usurious in nature, and contrary to their property rights. The owners also claimed that the structure was permanently placed upon a permanent foundation and therefore was not a trailer. The court found that the owners could not challenge the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance because there was no evidence that they applied for and were denied an building permit by the town's zoning board. Because they were challenging the ordinance's constitutionality as it applied to them, it was incumbent that they comply with the provisions of the ordinance before attacking its validity. Further, N.Y., Town Zoning Ordinance&sect; 905 gave the town the authority to institute the appropriate action to prevent the unlawful construction of a building or to prevent any illegal act on the premises. Even if the structure on the owners' property was not a trailer, they were still required to obtain a building permit. The court granted the town's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted summary judgment to the town but stayed the injunctive relief for a period of 30 days in order to give the owners time to apply for the appropriate permits from the town. If the owners failed to apply for the permits, they would be enjoined from maintaining and occupying the trailer on their land.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The certification by a Town Clerk that a Zoning Ordinance was duly passed is presumptive evidence of adoption, publication and posting, and must be taken as established in the absence of a question of fact raised by defendants as to its proper passage.</SPAN></P>

In an action to enjoin defendants from maintaining a trailer on their land on the ground that they did not obtain a building permit as required by the Zoning Ordinance and on the further ground that a trailer may not be erected or used on land in defendants' district, defenses concerning the constitutionality of the ordinances may not be considered until defendants&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  have applied for and been denied a permit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retailers brought an action for a declaratory judgment against defendant, the State Liquor Authority, testing the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 101-b, subd. 3. The retailers also sought a preliminary injunction restraining the Authority from enforcing the challenged sections of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the retailers were licensed to operate retail package stores at locations within and without the state. The court further found that the challenged sections involved the Authority's right to set a price schedule to which sellers, manufacturers, and wholesalers were required to comply. The court noted that the constitutionality of some of the sections had previously been upheld and, therefore, the court disposed of those allegations of the complaint. As to the other sections, the court held that the price-fixing mandated by the act was a proper exercise of the police power. The court reasoned that legislation concerning sales of goods, and incidentally affecting prices, had repeatedly been held valid. With respect to the preliminary injunction, the court concluded that the retailers failed to show that they had sustained, or would have sustained in the future, damage to a pecuniary interest. Accordingly, the court held that they were not aggrieved parties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs have failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality attaching to section 7 of chapter 531 of the Laws of 1964, which amended the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law so as to forbid the sale of brand liquors and wines to retailers except at prices shown on schedules filed by the sellers. Price-fixing is a proper exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiffs, retailers, have also failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality attaching to section 10 of chapter 531 and section 11 of chapter 531.  The repeal effected by section 11 was a necessary corollary to the enactment of the new price-fixing provisions of section 7 in relation to retailers.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs have failed to establish such an interest as to give them the right to challenge section 9.  So far as plaintiffs are concerned, section 9 is not related to section 7 except in the possibility that the effect of section 9 might result in lower schedule prices to retailers.

Section 104 was amended in 1963 to state that it is immaterial that another relative is also liable; but this amendment merely codified existing decisions which interpeted the statute to that same effect; hence the statute validly covers public assistance which was rendered prior to 1963.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1943, defendant filed a motion for resentencing of a sentence he received as a third offender for attempted grand larceny.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1951, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted grand larceny. Initially, he was sentenced to 5 to 10 years' imprisonment. In a subsequent habeas corpus proceeding, his conviction was vacated. On remand in 1954, he was again convicted on his guilty plea and sentenced as a second felony offender to a term of two and half to seven and half years imprisonment. In 1956, he was sentenced to 5 to 10 years' imprisonment as a second offender, when the court elected not to conduct a trial upon the issue of his identity as the same person convicted in 1951 and to treat him as a second offender upon the basis of an Indiana conviction, which he admitted. Upon resentence in 1960 as a third offender, defendant received the same sentence after admitting his identity as the person convicted in 1951. Defendant attacked the 1954 conviction, which was used as a predicate for the 1960 sentence. The court found that the amendment to &sect; 1943 made by 1964 N.Y. Laws ch. 446 did not apply to predicate judgments of conviction had in New York State courts. The court held that relief by way of a motion for resentence was not available where the challenged predicate conviction was obtained in a New York court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion for resentence without prejudice to an application to vacate the judgment of conviction alleged to be invalid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Section 1943 of the Penal Law, as amended by chapter 446 of the Laws of 1964, permits challenge at the time of sentence to previous convictions relied upon to increase the allowable punishment where it is claimed that such convictions had been obtained in violation of defendant's constitutional rights. The remedy is by an objection at the time of sentence, the court to determine the merits of the objection and failure to challenge at the time of sentence is declared a waiver unless good cause be shown for such failure.  Such amendment and the procedure therein do not apply to previous judgments of conviction, used as basis for multiple offender punishment, where the judgments were had in New York State, but do apply to out-of-State judgments.  Accordingly, defendant's motion for resentence on the claim that a 1954 New York conviction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  could not be used as a predicate for third felony offender punishment is denied as not available.

The court held that N.Y. Gen. Corp.

C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding, requesting a hearing to determine whether respondents, Commissioner of Education of the State of New York and others, abused their discretion and acted arbitrarily and capriciously in a manner violative of the individuals' rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals further sought an order directing respondents to change the examination to make it more appropriate for the practice of chiropractic. Respondents moved for an order, pursuant to N.Y.

The court rejected the individuals' claims that the questions were prepared to test the qualifications of doctors of medicine and in no way were applicable to the practice of chiropractic. The court held that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6552 did not limit the interrogations to only those subjects provided for in N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6507, but mandated only the use of &sect; 6507 questions on the examinations involving the subjects of anatomy, physiology, chemistry, pathology and diagnosis without precluding examinations on the additional basic subjects enumerated in N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6552(1) such as hygiene and bacteriology.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Justice of the Peace of the Town of Vestal, Broome County, New York, which found defendant guilty of failing to yield the right of way, in violation of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was prosecuted under &sect; 1143, which required the driver of a vehicle about to enter a highway from a private road or driveway to &quot;yield the right of way to all vehicles approaching on said highway.&quot; Defendant claimed on appeal, among other things, that &sect; 1143 was unconstitutional. The court reversed defendant's conviction, holding that the version of &sect; 1143 that was in effect at the time of defendant's trial was unconstitutionally vague. The court noted that a county court had declared the phrase &quot;yield the right of way to all vehicles approaching on said highway&quot; to be vague in that it was unclear as to what constituted an approaching vehicle. The court also noted that the legislature recognized that the definition of the phrase &quot;right of way,&quot; as found in the version of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 139 in effect at the time of defendant's trial, was itself vague and that the legislature amended &sect; 139 to provide a more precise definition. Based on the county court's decision and the act of the legislature in amending &sect; 139, the court concluded that N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1143 was unconstitutional and, therefore, that defendant's conviction could not stand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Section 1143 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, providing that &quot;The driver of a vehicle about to enter or cross a highway from a private road or driveway shall yield the right of way to all vehicles approaching on said highway&quot;, was unconstitutionally vague, prior to October 1, 1964, when read in conjunction with former section 139 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, which defined &quot;right of way&quot; as &quot;The privilege of the immediate use of the roadway.&quot; However, effective October 1, 1964, former section 139 has been repealed and replaced with a more exact definition: &quot;The right of one vehicle or pedestrian to proceed in a lawful manner in preference to another vehicle or pedestrian approaching under such circumstances of direction, speed and proximity as to give rise to danger of collision&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unless one grants precedence to the other.&quot; Thus, section 1143 is now constitutional and valid.

Intervenor unions sought dismissal of a portion of the teacher's cause and an order that the hearing be conducted in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher's application for a transfer was denied. She alleged that she was ready, willing, and able to resume her services as a teacher; and that the superintendent's failure to grant her a transfer was arbitrary, capricious, unjust, and illegal. The court held that under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 683 all public employees were given the right to representation in grievance procedures. The teacher had the right to have at the hearing scheduled before the superintendent of schools a representative of the City Teacher's Association to advance her grievance. In that respect, the court granted the teacher's petition. The court found no basis for a determination that the superintendent acted in an arbitrary, capricious, or illegal manner in deferring consideration of the transfer until after the third stage of the appeal. The court accordingly dismissed that portion of the proceeding without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Despite a purportedly exclusive collective bargaining agreement between the Board of Education of the City of New York and the United Federation of Teachers Local 2 American Federation of Teachers AFL-CIO (abbreviated as UFT), and despite the fact that petitioner teacher was represented by UFT in the first two stages of the grievance procedures provided for in said agreement, the teacher is entitled at the third stage or any stage of the grievance procedures or hearings to designate a different representative (General Municipal Law, art. 16, &sect;&sect; 683, 683-a) -- in this case, the City Teachers' Association of New York (N.

Article 16 of the General Municipal Law is not limited to grievance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  procedures established after October 1, 1963.  The article (&sect; 682) does exclude the government of the City of New York, but it does not exclude the Board of Education of the city school district of New York.  Section 683-a (added in 1964 to said article 16) is not a private or local bill.  Said Board of Education and its Superintendent of Schools are directed to proceed with the third stage of petitioner's grievance appeal and to permit her to be represented at such hearing by a representative of CTA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner also applies for a &quot;hardship transfer&quot; out of the school to which she is presently assigned, on the ground that the principal of said school is waging a campaign of harassment against her.  However, the Superintendent of Schools cannot well determine this issue until her grievance appeal is heard and determined as above set forth. Therefore, this portion of petitioner's application is dismissed, without prejudice.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court addressed defendant Department of Mental Hygiene's claim against the testatrix's estate in plaintiff executor proceeding under N.Y. Surr. Ct. Act. &sect; 211-b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon her death in 1963, the testatrix left a daughter that was a patient in a state hospital. In 1952, an agent of the Department indicated to the testatrix that it would accept less than the monthly cost of the daughter's care but that the Department reserved the right to file a claim against the testatrix's estate. After the testatrix's death, the executor brought a proceeding under N.Y. Surr. Ct. Act &sect; 211-b, and the Department filed a claim against the testatrix's estate. The executor argued against the claim, arguing that the amendment to N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 24(1) effected by 1956 N.Y. Laws ch. 809 removed parents from those who could be liable for the differential between the actual cost of hospitalization and the amount set by the Commissioner of the Department. The court dismissed the Department's claim, finding that the 1956 amendment removed all past, present, and future liability of parents for the differential between the actual cost of hospitalization of a child in a state institution and the lesser payment set by the Commissioner. The court ruled that communication by the Department's agent did not amount to an agreement by the testatrix to pay any differential.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State Department of Mental Hygiene wrote testatrix, the mother of a patient in a State mental hospital, on March 6, 1952 that although the actual cost of hospitalization for her daughter was $ 85 per month, they would accept $ 12 per month.  Such letter did not constitute an agreement on the part of testatrix to pay any differential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The amendment of subdivision 1 of section 24 of the Mental Hygiene Law, effected in 1956, removed the authority of the Commissioner of Mental Hygiene to assess a differential claim against anyone except the patient or his estate, and removed any liability, past, present and future, of parents for the differential&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  between the actual cost of maintenance and hospitalization of a child in a State institution and the lesser payment set by the Commissioner.

Accordingly, the general provisions of the Village Law ( &sect;&sect; 34, 35, 188-a) which appear to free any newly created village from liability for future debts of any special district of which its territory was a part, and which authorize an incorporated village to establish its own police department, do not apply to the Suffolk County Police District.  Three years after the Suffolk County Police District was created, the Village of Port Jefferson was incorporated, within the Town of Brookhaven.  The electors of that town had voted in favor of the police district.  The electors of such newly created village had no&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  power to vote to dissociate the village from the County Police District and to establish a separate police department for the village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Suffolk County Charter (L. 1958, ch. 278, as amd.) was adopted in accordance with article IX of the New York State Constitution.  The provisions of said Charter (&sect;&sect; 1206, 1207, 1210, subd. a), under which the Suffolk County Police District is established and is supported by taxes levied on the real property within said police district, are valid and constitutional.  It cannot be said that those provisions, as applied to the subsequently created Village of Port Jefferson, violate constitutional provisions against &quot;local bills&quot; for &quot;Incorporating villages&quot; (N. Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 17), or constitute a deprivation of home rule, or a &quot;transfer&quot; of a function of an existing village government without its electors' consent (N. Y. Const., art. IX, former &sect; 2), or a disenfranchisement of the voters of this village, or a denial to them of the equal protection of the laws, or an imposition on them of a tax burden which deprives them of liberty or property (N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 6, 11; U. S. Const., 14th Amdt.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In Suffolk County, which has&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  no cities or wards, the towns have been the basic units of government since 1703 (L. 1703, ch. 131).  Each town supervisor is chosen by the entire electorate of his town to sit on the County Board of Supervisors, and there he has only one vote, regardless of the great differences in population among the various towns.  This system has not been repealed or modified by the State Constitution (first adopted in 1777) or by any subsequent Legislature of the State.  There is now pending in the United States District Court an action to declare the Suffolk County Charter unconstitutional on the ground of this disproportionate representation on the County Board of Supervisors by the supervisors of towns which have small populations.  In this situation, this State court of original jurisdiction will not adjudge that, because of such disproportionate representation, the Suffolk County Charter (particularly &sect;&sect; 201, 203, 1206, 1207, 1210, subd. a) and the County Law ( &sect;&sect; 150, 153, subd. 4) violate the due process and equal protection clauses of both the State and the Federal Constitutions.  The court will rest on the presumption of constitutionality of legislation.  Therefore, this action and this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  proceeding, seeking a refund of, and an injunction against, taxes levied on real property in the Village of Port Jefferson for the support of the Suffolk County Police District, are dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Substituted service was made on defendant by posting a copy of the summons and complaint at his last known address pursuant to an order of the court issued in reliance upon N.Y. C.P.L.R. 308(4). Defendant claimed that the service was invalid since he was not living at the address specified in the order at the time service was made. Defendant also contended that &sect; 308(4) was unconstitutional as an improper delegation of power to the judiciary. The court denied the motion, reasoning that it was not disputed that defendant was residing at the address prior to the time that service was made, that he answered correspondence delivered to that address, and that he listed that address as his residence with the Motor Vehicle Bureau. The court explained that an existing domicile continued until a new one was acquired and that the burden of proof rested upon the party who alleged a change. The court determined that a legislative enactment carried with it an exceedingly strong presumption of constitutionality. The court stated that although the presumption was rebuttable, defendant failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect; 308(4) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Substituted service in compliance with an order of the court was not invalid and gave the court jurisdiction even though defendant was not living at the address specified in the order when service was made.

An existing domicile continues until a new one is acquired and the burden of proof rests upon the party who alleges a change.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The power of the court to determine a method of service of process in special cases pursuant to CPLR 308 (subd. 4) is judicial and the subdivision is not unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of legislative power.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court analyzed the local law and found that the law at issue established no condition prerequisite to the village clerks' sending the notice, no provision of any kind was made for entry upon land, or the removal and destruction of the motor vehicle, either as to authority, responsibility, time, place, manner of doing, and record of property taken; or for any deposition, complaint, information, hearing, warrant, writ, or determination prior to the entry upon land and removal and destruction of the motor vehicle. The court noted that two of the informations referred to those defendants as having willfully stored abandoned motor vehicles. The court held that willfully storing on one's property negated abandonment, therefore, those two informations contained a defense to the charges upon their face. The court held that the portion of the local law assessing a penalty against violators was unenforceable, because it was so confusing in language. The court also held that defendants were within their rights in resisting the unlawful action of the village in attempting to remove the property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

The shipment froze, and the detergents were damaged. The shipper filed an action against the carrier that sought to recover for the damages.

The court granted the carrier's motion to dismiss the complaint. The court explained that N.Y. Bus. Corp. &sect; 1314(b)(5) enabled an action against the carrier if the carrier was engaged in business in New York. The court determined that the carrier was not a New York corporation and the shipment contract with the shipper had no substantial contacts with New York, so the carrier was entitled to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the trial court (New York), pursuant to N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 813-c, defendant filed a motion to suppress certain evidence he alleged was unconstitutionally obtained that resulted in his indictment for aiding and abetting a felony under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1751.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police had a search warrant for a garage only. They saw a man buying a silver foil package from a &quot;seller&quot; in the garage, who sent defendant to obtain the package. A police officer followed the buyer after he left, arrested and searched him, and found the foil package containing narcotics. Defendant and the seller were arrested. Defendant refused to plead guilty and was indicted for aiding and abetting a felony under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1751. Defendant filed a motion to suppress, alleging that the contraband unreasonably seized from the buyer could not have been used against him. The court granted the motion and held that the narcotics in question were unconstitutionally seized from the buyer. The court held that the primary taint doctrine applied only to &quot;derivative evidence,&quot; but the illegal search of the buyer led to defendant's arrest. The court held that if any &quot;derivative&quot; evidence had been found on defendant, it would not have been admissible as the &quot;fruits of the poisonous tree.&quot; The court found that if a search was directed against others than the person searched, then the product of an unreasonable search was not admissible against such others.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- unlawful search and seizure -- narcotics seized by unlawful search of buyer of package cannot lawfully be used as evidence against defendant who is separately charged with felony of aiding sale of said narcotics; such defendant has standing to move to suppress such evidence (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 813-c); defendant's motion is granted -- constitutional principles require exclusion, not only of unlawfully seized evidence, but also of fruits of unlawful search.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Police observed a garage and saw that a person therein sold a package to a buyer and that the seller sent the present defendant to the rear of the garage to get the package for him.  One policeman followed the buyer and arrested him and found narcotics in the package. Meantime, other policemen arrested both the seller and the present defendant.  The buyer was charged with the misdemeanor of possession of narcotics ( Penal Law, &sect; 1751-a); but on his pretrial motion, it was held that the search warrant, which the police had obtained, to search the garage, was not intended to include the buyer who was not described in the search warrant, and that what the police observed was not the commission of a crime in their&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  presence (under Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 177, subd. 1, prior to its amdt. on July 1, 1963); and that, therefore, the search was not a reasonable incident of a lawful arrest; accordingly the narcotics were suppressed as evidence, but, as contraband, were not returned (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 813-c).  As for the seller, the charge against him was reduced to a misdemeanor to which he was permitted to plead guilty. As for the present defendant, he refused to plead guilty, and eventually he was indicted for aiding and abetting the selling, as a felony ( Penal Law, &sect; 1751).  The People concede that they propose to use the seized evidence against this defendant.  Therefore, his motion to suppress, as against himself, the evidence which had been unlawfully seized from the buyer, is granted (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 813-c).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Regardless of whether or not the court's findings in the case against the buyer are binding in the case against the present defendant, who was not &quot;the moving party&quot; in that other case (cf. Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 813-c), this court independently finds that the package of narcotics was unconstitutionally seized from the buyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The present defendant has standing to move to suppress&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such evidence, since said section 813-c of our Code of Criminal Procedure provides that: &quot;A person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure and having reasonable grounds to believe that the property * * * may be used as evidence against him in a criminal proceeding, may move for the * * * suppression of its use as evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures requires the suppression, not only of unlawfully seized evidence, but also of the product or fruits of the unlawful search. This exclusionary principle of law is intended to deter lawless law enforcement. One of the targets of the police officers' unlawful search of the buyer was this present defendant.  If this defendant and the buyer had been charged together or had been tried together, this seized evidence would be admissible against neither of them.  If both of them had been arrested together after consummation of the sale, both arrests would have been unlawful and the search would have been unreasonable as to both of them.  The fact that this defendant has been separately arrested and separately charged should not change the constitutional principle.  Accordingly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this defendant's motion to suppress the evidence which was unconstitutionally seized from another person -- the buyer -- is granted.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 150 required a person to have been a naturalized citizen for at least 90 days prior to the day of an election in order to vote therein. The naturalized citizen registered to vote but was not allowed to vote in the next general election because the 90-day waiting period had not expired. The naturalized citizen brought a motion for an order declaring &sect; 150 unconstitutional, null, and void. The court held that the State could set forth voter qualifications applying to all citizens but could not establish degrees of citizenship. By imposing the additional 90-day requirement upon a naturalized citizen, the State created a separate standard for citizens who had been naturalized. This was in direct conflict with the Constitution of the United States. Accordingly, N.Y. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, and N.Y. Elec.

The State may prescribe reasonable limitations upon the right to vote, but such standards must be consonant with our basic constitutional precepts and may not discriminate between citizens by birth and citizens by naturalization (U.

Penal Law &sect; 484-h by selling two magazines containing photographs of nude and partially nude females to a youth under the age of 18 years. At the close of the State's case, defendant filed a motion to dismiss on constitutional grounds. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional in its application to defendant's case. It was the intention of the Legislature to treat separately narrative and pictorial presentations. The publications were sorely lacking in taste, but were not so violative of contemporary community standards as to constitute &quot;hard-core pornography.&quot; The court also determined that the statute was so broad in its potential sweep that it was too vague to meet the constitutional requirements of the federal and State constitutions. The statute lacked specificity because it prohibited the pictures in the magazines at issue as well as classic works of art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants participated in the initiation of the victims as pledges into their fraternity. The indictment stated that defendants wrongfully and knowingly assaulted the victims by striking them about the body and face. In addition to the charges for hazing in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1030, defendants were charged with multiple counts of assault. Defendants' main objection was that &sect; 1030 was unconstitutionally vague. The court denied both the motions filed by defendants. The court concluded that: (1) a criminal statute had to be sufficiently explicit so that all those subject to its penalties knew what acts it was their duty to avoid; (2) &sect; 1030 was constitutional as applied because the term hazing had a common meaning that was reasonably ascertainable; (3) acts of hazing which occurred off-campus were prohibited by &sect; 1030; (4) due to the extreme violence of the assaults, it could not be held that the victims had consented to the assaults; and (5) after a review of the grand jury minutes, there was sufficient evidence to sustain the indictment.</SPAN></P>

Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 399).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Penal Law ( &sect; 1030; L. 1894, ch. 265) makes it a misdemeanor to commit &quot;what is commonly called hazing, in or while attending * * * public schools&quot;.  The statute is not too vague to be valid and constitutional.  The term &quot;hazing&quot; is defined in dictionaries and is commonly understood.  In this case, four students of a school in a union free school district were properly indicted for hazing five students who were pledges of a fraternity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It is immaterial that the hazing occurred in a private home, not on school grounds.  The words &quot;in or while attending&quot; pertain to the status of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the defendants and not to the locus of the hazing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The defendants were also properly indicted for third degree assault (Penal Law, &sect; 244).  One boy spent several weeks in a hospital as a result of the beating.  It cannot be said that the victims consented to physical harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The defendants also contend that the evidence before the Grand Jury did not show criminal intent, and that the victims were accomplices whose testimony requires corroboration (cf. Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 399).  The court has read the Grand Jury minutes and is satisfied therefrom that the evidence sustains the indictment. Defendants' motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes and to dismiss the indictment is denied.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that a conviction in Nebraska was obtained in violation of his right to counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that his conviction of forgery in a Nebraska district court nine years earlier was obtained in violation of his constitutional rights because he was not advised of his right to counsel and did not understandingly and intelligently waive such right. The court denied defendant's application. The court held as follows: (1) defendant's bare averment that he did not consciously waive his right to counsel was controverted by a contemporaneous record of the Nebraska court, which indicated clearly that the rights of defendant were made known to him and that he waived the same; (2) defendant did not sustain the burden of establishing by a fair preponderance of the evidence the averment of his petition, that he was not advised of the right to counsel and did not consciously waive the right of counsel in the Nebraska; and (3) when defendant entered his plea of guilty in the Nebraska proceeding, he was fully aware of the consequences thereof and he was afforded every right to which he was entitled under the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, now 48 years old, has had nine convictions, three of which were for felonies. He now applies to be resentenced as only a second felony offender, on the asserted ground that, 13 years ago at age 35 when he pleaded guilty in Nebraska of a felony, he did not understandingly and knowingly waive his constitutional right to counsel. A full hearing has now been had by this New York court on this issue (see Penal Law, &sect; 1943, as amd. by L. 1964, ch. 446).  The Nebraska court's record states that this defendant waived his right to counsel. His present testimony is not sufficiently credible to refute the judgment and document of a court of a sister State.  Defendant has had an eighth grade education.  He has no language barrier. He knows about assigned counsel; on at least two&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of his prior convictions in New York he had the benefit of assigned counsel. Yet, after the present hearing was completed he wrote a letter to this court, denying that he knew that he was being represented by counsel on this hearing -- although he was most effectively represented by experienced Legal Aid Society counsel assigned to him by this court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fire department had been incorporated by 1864 N.Y. Laws ch. 140 and was authorized by the terms of that act to receive funds derived from a tax upon foreign insurance companies doing business in the city and to administer such funds for the benefit of injured firefighters and others. The challenged ordinances purported to give the treasurer of the city power to collect and administer the taxes imposed by N.Y. Ins. Law &sect;&sect; 553, 554 upon the foreign insurance companies. The court held that the city did not possess the power to amend or supersede a special incorporating and authorizing act of the state legislature, where that act was not a special act involving the property, affairs, and government of the city. Further, the taxes collected under &sect;&sect; 553, 554 were state funds and subject to control by the state legislature only. Although matters concerning the organization, operation, and administration of fire departments were local affairs within the meaning of the New York Home Rule Law, the imposition of the tax upon foreign insurance companies was state-wide; hence, the funds derived from the tax were state, and not city, property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, charged with first degree murder, filed a motion for a pretrial determination of the voluntariness of a written statement made by him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court initially ruled that defendant was not entitled to a pretrial determination of the voluntariness of the statement because the prosecution had not yet offered to introduce the statement into evidence. Defendant then applied for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging the legality of his detention. On reconsideration of defendant's request for a pretrial determination of voluntariness, the court again opined that a hearing to determine the voluntariness of a statement was premature until such statement was offered. To prevent further delay, however, the court vacated its previous order and scheduled a hearing on the issue of voluntariness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated its previous order that had denied a pretrial determination of the voluntariness of defendant's statement, scheduled a hearing on the issue of voluntariness, and denied defendant's motion for a stay as moot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The voluntariness, if disputed, of a defendant's confession or statement must be determined by the court alone, and the jury must have no inkling as to it.  If the court determines that the statement was voluntary, it will be submitted to the jury to determine its contents, weight and credibility; and thus, evidence as to the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement may then be submitted to the jury.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Ordinarily, there is no reason why the issue of the voluntariness of a confession should be determined pretrial; the proper time for the court to determine that issue is if and when the District Attorney offers to introduce the confession in evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the wholesale distributor was an out-of-state corporation with no offices in the state, and not authorized to do business in the state. The telephone directory did not contain the wholesale distributor's listing. The wholesale distributor did not maintain any salesmen soliciting business within the state, it had no assets or bank accounts within the state, nor did it own any real estate or personalty within the state.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an action to recover damages for breach of contract, the court failed to acquire jurisdiction of the first defendant by personal service of process upon it in New Jersey.  The facts indicate that plaintiffs made a contract with the second defendant who is now out of business and there are insufficient facts to establish any privity of contract between defendants.  The sole contact of the first defendant with this State was its billing for the materials to plaintiffs and the limited negotiations regarding the complaints surrounding the alleged defective materials. To grant personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation on the basis of such unsubstantial contact would offend the traditional notions of justice and fair play. The complaint is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trade board filed a cause of action against defendant city seeking a judicial declaration that Local Law No. 45 of the year 1964 (Law), which fixed a minimum wage of $ 1.50 per hour was unconstitutional. Thereafter, the trade board filed a motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, for judgment declaring the Law unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In opposition to the trade board's motion for summary judgment, the city contended that the prior constitutional provision prohibited local laws inconsistent with the laws of the state, whereas the amendment prohibited local laws inconsistent with any general law. The city also argued that the State Minimum Wage Act was not a &quot;general law&quot; pursuant to N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 3 (d)(1), because the Industrial Commissioner was authorized to establish a different minimum wage rate for different localities in respect to particular industries. The court granted the motion and held that the Law was a &quot;general law&quot; because the provisions for a minimum wage up to $ 1.25 per hour and the establishment by the Commissioner of a higher minimum wage for particular occupations, varying with localities, applied alike to all cities and counties. The court held that there was nothing in the new amendment to the New York Constitution, which authorized any departure from the appellate court's decision that the Law was unconstitutional. The court then held that the Law violated the constitutional prohibition against local laws inconsistent with &quot;general laws&quot; of the state on the same subject.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A local law of the City of New York imposing a minimum wage of $ 1.50 per hour is inconsistent with the State Minimum Wage Act (Labor Law, &sect;&sect; 650-665) which provides a minimum wage of $ 1.15 per hour until October 15, 1964 and is unconstitutional.  A change in article IX of the Constitution effective January 1, 1964 so that local laws could not be inconsistent with &quot;any general law&quot; as compared with a prior provision prohibiting inconsistency with the &quot;laws of the State&quot; does not render the local law constitutional on the theory that the State Minimum Wage Act is not a general law. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission sought enforcement of its order, which held that the union and the employer members denied qualified minority groups the right to be admitted to and participate in the sheet metal apprentice program solely because of race and color.

The court affirmed the commission's findings, holding that no provision existed safeguarding any applicant against discrimination because of race, color, creed, or national origin and that there was no provision entitling an applicant to seek review of a rejection of his application for training. The court held that the provision in the apprenticeship-training program for preference or credit because of filial relation was illegal and unconstitutional because it was contrary to modern day societal objectives concerning job qualifications. The court held that admission to a profession or industry based exclusively upon the applicant's qualifications to perform in the profession or industry as determined by objective criteria was to be encouraged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted 1915 N.Y. Laws ch. 359, which provided for the physical annexation by the City of certain areas. The enactment directed the Rochester Board to receive children residing in the unannexed portion of the school district without payment of tuition. Many years later, the City adopted Rochester, N.Y., Local Law No. 8 (May 28, 1963), which required payment of tuition by the children residing in the unannexed areas. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that Local Law No. 8 was invalid. Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment, which the court granted. The court held that the annexation statutes were a valid exercise of the legislature's powers. The court further held that Local Law No. 8 was unconstitutional. The court noted that public education was a state and not a city function. In addition, a board of education was a separate corporate body and the property, affairs, or government of a city did not include the board of education. Moreover, the New York Constitution expressly excluded from the power granted to cities to adopt local laws, any enactment that applied to or affected the administration of the public school systems in such cities.</SPAN></P>

Laws 531, &sect;&sect; 13, 14 repealed a prior law that denied liquor licenses where liquor stores were already located nearby. Denying the injunction and entering a judgment for the Authority, the court said that 1964 N.Y. Laws 531, &sect;&sect; 13, 14 were constitutional. The Authority determined whether the public convenience and advantage was promoted by the issuance of licenses and the location of licensees under N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 2, 1934 N.Y. Laws 478. The Authority exercised police power in the regulation of liquor traffic. Liquor licenses were not contracts between New York and the licensee such as to give the latter vested rights and so as to be protected against subsequent legislation. No person had a vested interest in any law or legislative policy that entitled the person to have it remain unaltered for the person's benefit.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The delegation of legislative power to license retail package liquor stores to the State Liquor Authority under sections 13 and 14 of chapter 531 of the Laws of 1964 which repealed subdivisions 4 and 4-a of section 105 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law and reaffirmed the power of the State Liquor Authority to determine &quot;whether public convenience and advantage will be promoted&quot; by the issuance of retail liquor package store licenses without other guides as to where such stores shall be located contains a sufficient guiding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  standard as to make such delegation of power constitutional.  The standard &quot;public convenience and advantage&quot; is specific and clear and is not so vague and indefinite as to be a mere general reference to public welfare.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayers brought the N.Y.C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding to compel respondent members of the Board of Trustees of the Village of Scarsdale, N.Y., to conduct a referendum regarding Scarsdale, N.Y., Local Law No. 1 (1963) or, in the alternative, to declare that provision and 1963 N.Y. Laws ch. 897 unconstitutional. The taxpayers also asked the court to require the Board to continue using certain lands as parks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board developed plans to convert a village-owned park into a parking lot. The New York legislature passed enabling legislation, 1963 N.Y. Law ch. 897, authorizing the change in the use of the land &quot;by ordinance or local law.&quot; The Board then enacted Scarsdale, N.Y., Local Law No. 1 (1963), which discontinued the dedication of the land as a park. The taxpayers then requested a referendum on the issue and filed the petition after the request was denied. The court rejected the taxpayers' claim that N.Y. Village Home Rule Law &sect; 17 subd. 6 (current version at N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 24) required a referendum; discontinuance of the land as a park did not constitute an alienation of village property. The court also held that the local ordinance and the enabling legislation were not unconstitutional. The Board complied with N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 16, as well as New York Village Home Rule Law &sect; 22 (current version at N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 40). The mayor's statement that the village did not have the authority under local law to change the land's use was sufficient to establish the necessity for the enabling legislation, and that legislative determination was not reviewable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff class representative attacked 1963 N.Y. Laws ch. 204, &sect; 467-a, which required attorneys who had been admitted to practice before September 1, 1963 to file a certificate of registration and pay a fee. Defendant official filed a N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211 motion to dismiss. Construing the motion as one for summary judgment, art. 3211(c), for which no cross motion was necessary, art. 3211(b), the class representative sought summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Attorneys admitted before September 1963 had to register and pay a $ 15 fee. The class representative attacked the law on grounds of equal protection. The official sought dismissal on grounds that the complaint failed to state a cause of action and that no justiciable controversy existed that could be made the subject of a declaratory judgment. The court denied the official's motion to dismiss. The law was invalid under the equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and N.Y. Const. art. I. &sect; 11. The law discriminated in favor of lawyers admitted after September 1, 1963. Classifications that bore some reasonable relation to the object sought to be accomplished were a permissible discrimination. To justify a cutoff date, the inherent nature of the activity had to call for, or at least permit, a cutoff. But if the purpose was to register qualified attorneys, there was no rhyme or reason for a cutoff date. The classification was plainly arbitrary and unreasonable. The absence of a penalty did not render the law innocuous. Attorneys had to obey valid laws whether they carried any sting or not and were subject to disciplinary proceedings for ignoring them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 467-a of the Judiciary Law provides that every attorney licensed and admitted to practice on September 1, 1963 shall file a certificate of registration with the Clerk of the Court of Appeals, which certificate shall be accompanied by a fee of $ 15.  Such section denies the equal protection of the law to lawyers admitted prior to September 1, 1963 and discriminates in favor of those admitted after September 1, 1963.  Such classification bears no reasonable relation to the object sought to be accomplished. If the purpose is to register qualified attorneys, there is no reason for the cutoff date of September 1, 1963.  The cutoff date prefers some members of a class at the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  expense of others of the same class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A justiciable issue is presented.  Despite the absence of a penalty in section 467-a, plaintiff's duty as an attorney is to obey valid laws and he is liable to disciplinary proceedings for ignoring them.  The passage of the deadline for registration has not rendered the threat any less real or destroyed the genuineness of the controversy.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporate landowner owned two parcels of land. The land on which its factory stood had been reclassified as industrially zoned, but the land behind it had not been rezoned and remained residentially zoned. The residential landowners owned land behind the corporate landowner's property, adjacent to the residentially zoned land. The corporate landowner filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment, seeking extinguishment of restrictive covenants placed on it when its land had been reclassified as industrially zoned. The court dismissed the complaint. The court held that there were no changed circumstances that would have permitted the extinguishment of the restrictive covenants and that the interest of the residential landowners in preserving the value of their property was a benefit to the residential landowners so as to preserve the restrictive covenant.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an action under section 1951 of the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law for a declaratory judgment to extinguish a restriction on the use of plaintiff's land that limits it to single-family residences, defendants, owners of one-family homes who sincerely believe that relinquishment of the restriction will cause them financial loss, are entitled to judgment adhering to the restriction which is valid and binding, even though some of their neighbors are willing to modify it.  It is immaterial that the village changed the zone of plaintiff's property permitting industrial use thereof.  There has been no change in the character of the neighborhood so as to render enforcement of the restriction ineffective.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A corporation was granted a permit to operate a golf course as an increased use under a prior zoning variance. The landowners, who were abutters of the golf course land, filed an application to have the use permit revoked or to have a public hearing on the permit. The board of appeals denied the application and the landowners sought review. Without reaching the merits of the landowners' claim, the court dismissed the action on the grounds that the landowners, by virtue of the fact that they were not residents or property owners of the village in which the golf course was located, were not &quot;aggrieved&quot; persons under N.Y. Village Law &sect; 179-b and therefore had no status to challenge the decision of the board of appeals of the village. In so holding, the court determined that &sect; 179-b did not violate the landowners' right to due process because the permit did not deny the landowners the use and enjoyment of their property in any way requiring notice and opportunity for a hearing. The court reasoned that the landowners had a remedy against the golf course in case of any interference with their use and enjoyment of their properties arising from the operation of the golf course.</SPAN></P>

Granting the motion, the court concluded that enough had been alleged to permit the granting of injunctive relief. The board's adoption of the plan and the subsequent implementation of it in sending and receiving students to and from different schools was clearly an unconstitutional exercise of power. The children attending a public school had a constitutional right to attend that school nearest their homes. They could not be compelled or arbitrarily forced to join a different ethnic group living miles away.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents challenged the election on procedural grounds, and also asserted that the statutory qualifications for voting were unconstitutional. The court first held that it did not have jurisdiction, pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2037, to consider the procedural matters because jurisdiction over those issues was vested in the Commissioner of Education. The court further concluded that the qualifications for voting were not unconstitutional. The court held that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2012, which required ownership of property or parentage of a child in school to vote, applied. The court found that N.Y. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, which had minimal voting requirements, was only applied to general elections relating to governmental affairs of the whole state. The court ruled that the statutory requirements of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, certain candidates who took a civil service competitive promotion examinations, instituted a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding in which they sought to have respondent, the Civil Service Commission of the State of New York, give them credit for answer &quot;D&quot; to a specific question. The Commission sought the dismissal of the petition. The court considered whether the question was susceptible of more than one answer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidates, some of whom were not parties to the proceeding, took one of two examinations. One question was identical and required an identical answer. The examinations were conducted subject to a &quot;pre-rating appeal procedure,&quot; which permitted a review of the examination by the candidates prior to any marking. A grader would then disclose the tentative key answers, and the candidates could object. All the party candidates selected answer &quot;D.&quot; The grader also selected &quot;D&quot; as the tentative key answer. After some non-party candidates filed objections to the selection of answer &quot;D,&quot; answer &quot;C&quot; was established as the final key answer. The party candidates asserted that the elimination of answer &quot;D&quot; and the acceptance of only answer &quot;C&quot; was arbitrary. Answer &quot;D&quot; contemplated the procedure set forth in N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 400, which had been declared unconstitutional; therefore, it was as if the statute had never been enacted. The court found that there was nothing ambiguous about the question. Because the question was susceptible of only one correct answer, which was answer &quot;C,&quot; the rights of the non-party candidates would have been prejudiced if answer &quot;D&quot; was also acceptable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent Civil Service Commission selected as the tentative key answer to an examination question an answer based on a statute which previously had been held unconstitutional by the courts.  Following objection by some of the candidates, the answer was changed, the final key answer taking the court ruling into consideration.  Under the circumstances, the particular question is susceptible of only one correct answer.  To direct respondents to accept another answer as equally correct would require them to act in an arbitrary and capricious manner.  Accordingly, a petition by candidates who had chosen the same answer as that selected as the tentative key answer, asking that they be given credit for their answer, is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff baseball pitcher sought an injunction against the unauthorized publication of a book purporting to be his biography by defendants, a writer and a publisher, and for damages for injuries sustained by reason of the publication and distribution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff baseball player sought injunctive relief and damages from defendants, a writer and a publisher of an unauthorized biography about plaintiff, alleging that defendants were taking pecuniary advantage of plaintiff's name, photographs, likeness, and private life to create for profit a fictionalized and dramatic story. Plaintiff contended that his private life and the concomitant commercial exploitation of his name and likeness constituted an infringement of plaintiff's right of privacy. The trial court granted the injunction and awarded plaintiff damages, holding that publication of the book about plaintiff constituted a violation of the prohibitions of N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 51. Defendants never interviewed plaintiff or any member of his family, friends, or any baseball player who knew him. Also, the record unequivocally established that the book publicized areas of plaintiff's personal and private life, albeit inaccurate and distorted, and consisted of a host of factual errors, distortions, and fanciful passages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that plaintiff baseball player was entitled to injunctive relief preventing the further publication and distribution of an unauthorized biography and was entitled to damages from defendants, the writer and publisher, for their violations of plaintiff's civil right to privacy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fictionalization of the life story of plaintiff, a baseball pitcher of wide renown and acclaim, published without his consent, the inclusion in the book of aspects of his private life and the commercial exploitation of his name and likeness constitute an infringement of plaintiff's right of privacy in violation of sections 50 and 51 of the Civil Rights Law. Defendants, the publisher and author of the book, have intruded upon plaintiff's solitude and into his private affairs, have disclosed embarrassing &quot;facts&quot; about plaintiff, placed plaintiff in a false light in the public eye and appropriated, for their advantage, plaintiff's name and likeness. The distortions, inaccuracies, invented dialogue, and the narration of happenings out of context, clearly indicate, at the very least, a careless disregard for the responsibility of the press and an abuse of the public's limited privilege to inquire into an individual's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  life.  The purported biography transgresses the bounds of legitimate public interest by its breadth of reportorial coverage of those areas of plaintiff's life, such as his deeply personal relationships with members of his immediate family and his introspective thoughts, which defy classification as public.  Plaintiff is granted an injunction preventing further publication and distribution of the book and damages of $ 10,000.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer filed a motion for a temporary injunction restraining completion of a proposed affiliation contract between a third hospital and defendants, the City of New York, New York, the Commissioner of Hospitals of the City of New York, New York, and a first hospital. Defendants' existing affiliation contract concerned medical care and related services at a second hospital.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants asserted that hospitals that were affiliated with medical schools or voluntary teaching hospitals provided the best care. The taxpayer asserted that the enabling legislation, New York City, N.Y., Charter &sect; 583-a, was unconstitutional because it unlawfully delegated legislative power to the Commissioner without any policy or guidelines. The court held that the taxpayer's attempt to restrain defendants from entering into another affiliation contract did not warrant injunctive relief pendente lite. The court found that the Commissioner had the power to furnish hospital services under New York City, N.Y., Charter &sect; 583-a and to do so through contracts under New York City, N.Y., Charter &sect; 583-a(b). The court ruled that no principle affecting a constitutional grant of that power could invalidate its accomplishment by means of the contract. The Commissioner did not legislate the performance of services under the contract, but delegated them, and the contract did not impair the Commissioner's ability to provide the services. The Commissioner could contract for services that would have been inadequate without association with a medical school or voluntary teaching hospital.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical school graduates are unwilling to accept internships in hospitals which are not affiliated with either a medical school or a voluntary teaching hospital. The City of New York maintains hospitals for the care of the indigent ill, and 11 of those municipal hospitals are not thus affiliated, and the result in those hospitals has been a steady deterioration of medical care and a loss of the accreditation certificate of the Joint Commission on Accreditation. In this emergency, the city's Commissioner of Hospitals with the approval of the city's Board of Hospitals and the city's Board of Estimate has properly made contracts affiliating certain municipal hospitals with a voluntary teaching hospital (New York City Charter, &sect;&sect; 583-a, 583-b, 587).  It cannot be fairly said that the cited sections unconstitutionally delegate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  legislative power to the Commissioner without sufficient guidelines, or that the contracts unconstitutionally delegate municipal police powers to the voluntary hospital.  In this taxpayer's suit, the plaintiff's motion for a temporary injunction against performance of the contracts is denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for murder in its first degree in the death of a payroll guard during a robbery and, along with his codefendant, was ordered to be executed. The judgment was reversed on appeal and a new trial was ordered after there was a statutory amendment to the basic punishment for murder in the first degree under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1045(1). Defendant then challenged the legality of his detention on the ground that the changes in the law were ex post facto and could not be applied to him, and his attorney filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus on his behalf. The court dismissed the writ, holding that the mere statutory change, which substituted the finding of a jury for that of a judge, could not be held to be unconstitutional as an ex post facto law and a law which changed punishment was not in and of itself an ex post facto law unless that change inflicted a greater or additional punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- ex post facto laws -- challenge to legality of law as ex post facto is not premature -- changes in law dealing with punishment for murder in first degree effective on defendant's new trial, eliminated death penalty, except that, if Judge did not sentence to life imprisonment, jury which found defendant guilty, could be reconvened and jury could decide whether to sentence to life imprisonment or death and in that proceeding any evidence, even if otherwise excludible, shall be received; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is not ex post facto because of kind of evidence admissible in proceeding subsequent to trial -- sentence of life imprisonment is less than sentence of death and therefore change in law is not ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A change in the law dealing with punishment for the crime of murder in the first degree became effective July 1, 1963, shortly before defendant's conviction for the crime of murder in the first degree, allegedly committed on May 10, 1961, was reversed by the Court of Appeals (13 N Y 2d 148) and a new trial ordered, to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which trial the new statute is applicable.  A challenge to the legality of defendant's detention on the ground that the law is ex post facto as to defendant is not premature. The validity of the statute is determinable by reference to what may happen thereunder in any alternative and not merely by reference to what verdict actually results upon the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The changes eliminate the mandatory death penalty formerly applicable to a common-law conviction for deliberate and premeditated murder or upon a jury's failure to recommend life imprisonment upon a conviction for felony murder. The basic punishment for murder in the first degree is life imprisonment but, if the court does not punish by life imprisonment, it shall &quot;conduct a proceeding to determine whether defendant should be sentenced to life imprisonment or to death * * * with the jury that found defendant guilty&quot; ( Penal Law, &sect; 1045-a, subd. 2).  In such proceeding (subd. 3) &quot;Any relevant evidence, not legally privileged, shall be received regardless of its admissibility under the exclusionary rules of evidence.&quot; The statute is not ex post facto because of the different kind of evidence permissible at the second stage portion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the trial.  The evidence admissible in the sentencing proceeding does not affect the type of evidence required to prove defendant's guilt and such evidence is pertinent only after a verdict of guilt. Even under the prior procedure, where the jury recommended life imprisonment, the court was not bound by such recommendation and, in order to determine whether to impose life imprisonment, the court could examine defendant's record and any otherwise inadmissible evidence.  Thus there is no basic change in the type of evidence to be considered under the sentencing power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A law which changes punishment is not, in and of itself, an ex post facto law unless that change inflicts a greater or additional punishment or affects the offender unfavorably.  A sentence of life imprisonment is lesser punishment than a sentence of death and, therefore, the changes in the law are not ex post facto. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband contended that the wife's prior Mexican divorce was void under New York law. The wife argued that the divorce was valid and that res judicata applied. The court noted that res judicata as a defense could be invoked only where the same parties and issues were before the court and the contested issues were definitively determined on the merits, determined that any findings by the Mexican courts could not operate as res judicata in New York, and dismissed the defense on the facts and as a matter of law. The court pointed out that contrary to the domestic concept of the marital res and jurisdiction predicated upon domicile, submission of the parties to the power of the court was the source of jurisdiction to grant a divorce in Mexico, and noted that the wife and her former husband violated the express interdiction of N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 51, which forbade agreements between a husband and wife to alter or dissolve the marriage. The court stated that unless one of the parties was domiciled in the divorcing state, its court had no power to hear the merits of the controversy, and concluded that the Mexican decree had no validity in New York and would not be recognized.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court directed judgment in favor of the husband, and a hearing with respect to alimony and counsel fee, which the court decreed the wife was entitled to recover.</SPAN></P>

The order of reinstatement was predicated on lack of notice to defendant of the &quot;incidente&quot; proceeding.  The Mexican appeals court had no power under Mexican law to decide the issue of the validity of the divorce on the merits.  Moreover, even if it determined the merits and the person who instituted the &quot;incidente&quot; proceeding were plaintiff, the decree would not be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since the validity of the divorce under New York law was not in issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant and her prior husband agreed in New York to divorce each other.  An attorney was engaged to effectuate the divorce who paid the fee of the Mexican attorney representing defendant and the Mexican attorney representing the husband.  The husband entered Mexico, signed a register, signed papers written in Spanish and returned to the United States within one hour.  He never became a domiciliary of Mexico.  The decree of divorce recited that the court had jurisdiction because the husband signed the register&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and both parties submitted to the jurisdiction of the court.  Since domicile is not recognized by the Mexican decree, the divorce is invalid.  Moreover defendant and her first husband violated section 51 of the Domestic Relations Law which forbids any agreement between a husband and wife to alter or dissolve the marriage by their collusive agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiff is awarded a decree annulling his marriage to defendant.  </SPAN></P>

The court determined that the legislature was within its authority to mandate the position of a candidate's name on the voting machine if the candidate was part of a slate and that its action to simplify the machine was fair, equitable, and reasonable. The court dismissed the petition and held that the candidate had failed to demonstrate the statute's unconstitutionality because it gave all candidates an opportunity to present an entire slate or to associate with others to become part of a slate. The court concluded that the candidate's contention of unequal protection of the law was meritless because all candidates had the same right to become members of a slate and thus to obtain the alleged preferred position on the machine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, school district taxpayers and voters, filed for declaratory judgment, an injunction, and other relief against defendant school board regarding alleged illegal acts of the board. The issue before the court was the school board's motion for summary judgment pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 3211(c) and its motion to dismiss pursuant N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 3211(a)(2) and (5) for lack of jurisdiction and failing to state a claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the school board consolidated two separate union free school districts into a single central district, the taxpayers argued that first, the board violated N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 1523(5) because, in part, the action was done without public notice. Second, because the consolidation was only intended to consolidate each district's debts, which unconstitutionally deprived the taxpayers of their property rights and imposed illegal taxes. Third, the board was transporting pupils among the former separate districts in violation of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 1805. The court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction as to only one count. It held that an appeal to the Commissioner of Education was the exclusive remedy where the validity of a district meeting was in dispute. But the court held that the other causes of action involved the determination of the legality or constitutionality of the acts of public officials or the interpretation of statutes and were all within the jurisdiction of the court for declaratory judgment. But the court granted the board's motion as to all three counts for failing to state a claim because the pleadings consisted of only conclusory allegations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Two union free school districts were consolidated (pursuant to Education Law, &sect;&sect; 1510 to 1513), and, about a month later, the Commissioner of Education validly made an order laying out the territory of this newly consolidated union free school district as a central school district (pursuant to Education Law, &sect; 1801).  Said order was not made too soon; section 1523 (subd. 5) of the Education Law is inapplicable.  Allegations, in this complaint by taxpayers and voters, that the sole purpose was to consolidate the debt burdens of the districts (cf. Education Law, &sect;&sect; 1517, 1518) and that plaintiffs are subjected to illegally levied taxes (cf.  Education Law, &sect; 1804, subds. 5, 6) and have been unconstitutionally deprived of property&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rights, are conclusory and insufficient.  Plaintiffs also allege that defendant board of education has discontinued the use of certain elementary school buildings and is transferring pupils among the buildings in the former separate districts, in violation of section 1805 of the Education Law; but, if the consolidation prior to the centralization was valid, section 1805 is inapplicable.  The only steps in the consolidation procedure in this case which may be attacked are the validity of the original request for consolidation (Education Law, &sect; 1511, subd. 1) and the Commissioner's approval of the proposed consolidation. Accordingly, the complaint is dismissed ( CPLR 3211, subd. [a], par. 7), without prejudice to an application for leave to replead if so advised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although an appeal to the Commissioner of Education is the exclusive remedy in the first instance to resolve a dispute as to the validity of a district meeting or the proceedings thereat (Education Law, &sect; 2037), an action for a declaratory judgment is proper, and is perhaps the only remedy, to determine a controversy involving the validity of multiple acts of the Commissioner of Education, District Superintendent of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Schools, boards of education, and electors of districts, resulting in consolidation and centralization. </SPAN></P>

The court granted the injunction, holding that the status quo of the children attending the schools tuition free should have been maintained until a final decision was reached on the merits.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of chapter 547 of the Laws of 1918 and chapter 519 of the Laws of 1922, school districts in certain towns were annexed by the City of Rochester, the legislation providing that students in the towns would attend schools in the city without the payment of tuition.

A town authorized its Supervisor to act as Town Public Welfare Officer (Social Welfare Law, &sect; 67, subd. 1) and then created the position of Assistant Town Public Welfare Officer.  Classification of such position in the exempt class is not required because subdivision 1 of section 67 of the Social Welfare Law provides that &quot;employees shall hold office during the pleasure of the town board&quot;.  Under section 6 of article V of the Constitution, positions must be placed in the competitive class unless it is not practicable to fill such positions by competitive examination. The Legislature may not classify a particular position in the exempt class unless it is one for which ascertainment of merit and fitness, or the filling of which, by competitive examination, is not practicable. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is no express language in section 67 placing the position in the exempt class.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole factual allegation which defendant urged in support of his motion was that a conversation with his former attorney about which he was alleged to have lied to the grand jury took place without any witnesses to it. Inasmuch as under New York law, there had to either be two witnesses to support a charge of perjury or strong corroborative evidence of the testimony of a witness, defendant implied that the district attorney must have presented evidence to the grand jury gained by electronic eavesdropping of his conversation with his attorney. The court held that defendant was not entitled to raise questions concerning the constitutionality of the electronic eavesdropping evidence heard by the grand jury by motion in the motion part but was required to present his intentions in the trial part. Moreover, the court held that a motion made in a motion part to discover and suppress eavesdropping evidence would be denied as there was no general right of discovery and defendant would suffer no prejudice in awaiting trial before challenging the constitutionality of evidence. Finally, the court held that the application for testimony before the grand jury would be granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a proceeding brought pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, petitioner bidder sought an order declaring a tax sale held by respondent county commissioner of finance to be null and void and directing a resale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bidder claimed that the sale was illegal on the grounds that it was in bulk and not by individual items. The court disagreed. The difference between a bulk sale and one by individual items was that in a bulk sale a bidder had to make a bulk bid for the entire delinquent tax roll rather than bid separately on each piece of property. The subject sale was advertised as a sale by individual items and not as a bulk sale. Were it not for the decision of the county to bid for all of the parcels, individual parcels could have been sold. The bid of the county made by the commissioner was pursuant to &sect; 7-7.0 of the Erie County Tax Act and in pursuance to the terms of a resolution and in pursuance to the terms of a resolution of the Board of Supervisors in which the commissioner offered to purchase all the parcels of real estate. Because there were thousands of parcels on which taxes were owed and since the county intended to purchase each parcel, it would have been a useless waste of time to read each parcel and the amount owed on it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the relief sought and dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- tax liens, tax sales and tax titles -- Erie County Tax Act validly prefers county over other bidders, and allows county to bid in all properties with one total bid, and allows judicial proceedings by owners only and not by mere bidders -- decisions construing Real Property Tax Law inapplicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Erie County Tax Act (L. 1942, ch. 812, as amd., &sect;&sect; 7-4.0, 7-6.0, 7-7.0, 7-11.0, 14-6.0) validly provides, as to tax sales, that &quot;The county treasurer may prescribe reasonable rules and regulations to expedite and govern the conduct of such sale and such rules and regulations shall be set forth in * * * pamphlet and shall be binding upon all persons attending such sale&quot; and that &quot;each parcel shall be sold for a sum sufficient to pay all the taxes, fees, penalties, interest and charges&quot;, and that &quot;The county of Erie may become a purchaser at any such sale and the offer of the county to purchase any parcel of land shall be preferred over all other offers made for the same&quot; and that &quot;No tax sale * * * shall be enjoined or * * * vacated except upon a proceeding brought therefor by the owner of such real&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  property&quot; and that any invalidity of any part of this law shall not affect the rest of the law.  Accordingly, for a tax sale of 6,738 separate parcels, each parcel and its owner and the total amount of tax charges on each parcel were listed; but the county Board of Supervisors by a resolution authorized its Commissioner of Finance to bid in, on behalf of the county, all of the parcels for the tax charges thereon; and, accordingly, the notice of sale stated that the Commissioner would purchase for the county all of the parcels. Accordingly, it would have been a waste of time to conduct separate sales of each parcel. The Commissioner made one bid of $ 862,652.03 for the 6,738 parcels and thus properly bought them all for the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Erie County Tax Act validly prefers the county over other bidders. There is no constitutional requirement that a tax sale be public, or be made by individual parcels. Moreover, this proceeding (under CPLR, art.  78) is brought, not by a property owner, but a bidding stranger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Decisions construing the Real Property Tax Law ( &sect; 1006; &sect; 1008, subd. 3) as preferring a bid of the full amount of the tax charges on a parcel for a nine-tenths interest&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the parcel, over a bid for the entire parcel or for all the parcels, do not apply to the quite differently worded provisions of the Erie County Tax Act. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several parents of school children filed a proceeding against the board of education for an injunction relating to a proposed transfer of students from one public school to another. The board argued that the purpose of the transfer was to alleviate overcrowding at a particular school. The parents argued that the transfers were effectuated to cure racial imbalance in the schools. The board argued that the parents were required to first prosecute an appeal to the State Commissioner of Education. The board also argued that the parents and their children were not aggrieved parties and thus could not bring the action. The court held that an initial appeal before the commissioner was unnecessary. Further, persons other than transferees had standing to bring the proceeding to enjoin violation of the statute. Each child had a right to attend only the public school in the district in which he resided. The court found that the Constitution did not require that there had to be an intermingling of the races in all school districts. The court held that the transfer was an arbitrary act and exceeded the bounds of sound discretion. As such, the act was set aside and enjoined.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The parents of the white pupils in the second neighborhood school who allege that the transfer violates their constitutional rights are not required to appeal to the Commissioner of Education first but have standing as aggrieved parties, to bring this proceeding to annul the action of the Board of Education, even though they are persons other than the transferred pupils or their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 3201 of the Education Law provides that no person shall be refused admission to or be excluded from any public school on account of race, creed, color or national origin.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Under the New York (art. I, &sect; 11) and Federal (14th Amdt.)

The transferred children had no constitutionally guaranteed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  right to attend a school outside the attendance area in which they resided.  By the transfer, respondents exercised power unconstitutionally.  Desegregation of schools as mandated by the United States Supreme Court does not mean that Negro children who live in a noncontiguous area must be bussed into a white area in order to desegregate a school attended by white pupils. The children of that school have an equal right to attend the school nearest their homes uninterrupted by an arbitrarily forced infusion of another ethnic group living two and one-half miles away.  Petitioners are entitled to restrain respondents from proceeding with the transfer of students and their determination to so do is annulled.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged statutes required new chiropractors, as prerequisite to obtaining a license to practice, and those with a certain number of years of experience to take: (1) the same examination given applicants for medical certificates in anatomy, physiology, chemistry, hygiene, bacteriology, pathology, and diagnosis; and (2) an examination in the use and effects of X-ray. The statutes also required chiropractors of greater experience to take an examination in fundamentals of anatomy and physiology. The chiropractors claimed that the statutes were discriminatory and that the examinations were a test of medical, rather than chiropractic knowledge, and were therefore inappropriate. The court ruled that the statutes were constitutional. Chiropractors treated the sick and made referrals to medical personnel. The legislature was warranted in not taking chances and in requiring chiropractors to prove their knowledge of the subject matters of the examinations. The statutes conferred on chiropractors privileges which, the state's highest court had determined, they could not claim as a matter of constitutional right. This was ample to meet the challenge that they were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property owners filed a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 petition against respondents, a state conservation commissioner, other state officials, a city mayor, and other city officials, that sought an annulment of certain action and an injunction against other actions against a proposed acquisition of their property for a park expansion. The state and city officials moved to dismiss the petition on grounds of legal insufficiency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">City officials adopted actions in connection with a proposed acquisition and condemnation of the owner's properties for an extension of a city park, which included an application to state officials for state aid for the costs of the acquisition, under the Park and Recreation Land Acquisition Act, N.Y. Conserv. Law art. 16-C. The city planning commission, the city board of estimates, and the city council approved the acquisition pursuant to the Act. Various state agencies had recommended approval of the aid application that was before the state comptroller for audit and disbursement. The owners contended that their properties were not predominately open or natural and therefore did not meet the standards for acquisition pursuant to the Act because the properties were fully developed and were utilized for commercial and industrial purposes, and that acceptance for state aid was illegal, arbitrary, and capricious. The owners further contended that the city's action were void because those actions were part of the application process. The court held that the petition failed to state a cause of action as to the city officials because all of the city's actions were authorized by law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion to dismiss as to the city officials.

The court set a hearing date as to certain allegations in the second cause of action of the property owners' petition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Park and Recreation Land Acquisition Act (Conservation Law, art.  16-C) provides that the cost of acquisition of land for park and recreation purposes under said act shall be borne three fourths by the State and one fourth by the municipality. The law further provides, in section 881 entitled &quot;Standards for acquisition&quot;: &quot;2.  Lands acquired * * * shall consist of predominantly open or natural lands&quot;.  Pursuant to said law, the City of New York has authorized the institution of condemnation proceedings to acquire 23.3 acres and 44.3 acres in Queens County.  Petitioners ( CPLR, art. 78) own real property in said acreage and they claim that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  said acres are not &quot;predominantly open or natural lands&quot; but rather are fully utilized for commercial and industrial purposes.  They further claim that a statement in the proceedings that there are 80 buildings on the acreage has been willfully and deceptively changed to read 14 buildings.  It cannot be said that these petitioners are in the same general class as citizens and taxpayers who cannot ordinarily challenge official State acts; rather, these petitioners are owners of property and businesses which will be specifically and particularly affected by an allegedly unlawful taking.  Their petition for judicial review is sufficient as to the State officials named: the State Council of Parks, the State Conservation Commissioner, and the State Comptroller. Said respondents may answer the petition and the issues will be set down for a hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. However, the petition is dismissed as to the city officials named: the Mayor and Board of Estimate and City Council and Planning Commission and Director of the Budget of the City of New York.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff administratrix brought a wrongful death suit after her intestate, a New York resident, was killed in an automobile accident with defendants' tractor-trailer on a Vermont highway about 15 miles from the New York border. Defendants sought dismissal of the summons and complaint, contending that New York did not have long arm jurisdiction over them. The court agreed, holding that: (1) the tractor was owned by the subcontractor who lived and was based in Vermont; (2) the trailer was owned by transportation company, which was a Vermont corporation; (3) defendants' business was to provide regular mail transportation service between New York and Vermont; (4) the death arose out of an automobile accident in Vermont and not out of any business transacted in New York; and (5) at the time of the accident the defendants were not doing or transacting any business within New York.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Jurisdiction was not obtained over a foreign corporation and its officer, which corporation entered into a contract with the United States to transport mail between Albany, New York and Burlington, Vermont, and then assigned the contract for performance to individual defendant, a nonresident, where the individual defendant who owned his own tractor rented the corporation's trailer and his employee was operating said&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tractor and trailer when it was involved in a collision in Vermont, which caused the death of plaintiff's intestate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1959, the Town published a notice of a public hearing concerning the adoption of the ordinance. Several days after the public meeting, the Town Board held a meeting and two changes were made in the proposed ordinance; the ordinance was adopted. The ordinance was not then entered in the minutes of the Town Board. It was not until March 1962 that a printed copy of the ordinance was inserted next to the page containing the minutes of the meeting in which it was adopted. The inserted copy was dissimilar from the one originally adopted in that it contained an amendment adopted in 1959 and there were other differences. In declaring the ordinance void, the court ruled that there was not substantial compliance with N.Y. Town Law &sect; 264. Section 264 required, inter alia, that every town ordinance be entered in the town board's minutes, posted on the town's bulletin board, and published in a newspaper. All of the critical publications having taken place three years after the ordinance was adopted, the court ruled that there was no substantial compliance with &sect; 264 which, the court presumed, required a town to make such publications within a reasonable time of adoption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff executors sought review of the decision of defendant state tax commission (New York), which determined that the value of real estate in Connecticut, which was owned by a New York partnership of which the decedent was a member, was to have been included as part of the decedent's gross estate subject to New York estate tax under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 249-r.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executors alleged that under Connecticut law the land was owned by the decedent and his partner as tenants in common, and that under &sect; 249-r out-of-state real estate was expressly excluded from the gross estate of a New York decedent. The state tax commission argued that all assets of the partnership, including the land in Connecticut, must have been included in fixing the value of the decedent's interest in the partnership. The court held that it was error to have included the value of the decedent's interest in the Connecticut real estate in determining the value of the decedent's intangible interest in the partnership. The appeal was sustained and the court ordered a redetermination of the tax. The court held that the tax law excluded the value of the decedent's interest in the foreign real estate. Each partner under the law of Connecticut owned an undivided interest as tenant in common and the value of the real estate should have been excluded in determining the value of the decedent's partnership interest.</SPAN></P>

[d]) has not been given extraterritorial effect -- law of Connecticut, common law, governs title to realty there acquired by decedent and son as copartners -- partners did not equitably convert realty into personalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The law of the State where real estate is situated, and not the New York Partnership Law, determines the title to such real estate owned by a New York partnership when one of the partners who is domiciled in New York dies.  Our Tax Law ( &sect; 249-r) expressly provides as to gross estates: &quot;except real property situated * * * outside this state&quot;.  Our Partnership Law ( &sect; 12, subd. 1; &sect; 51, subd. 2, par. [d]) provides that &quot;All property * * * brought into the partnership * * * by purchase or otherwise * * * is partnership property&quot; and that &quot;On the death of a partner his right in specific partnership property vests in the surviving partner or partners&quot;.  Perhaps these provisions could constitutionally be given extraterritorial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  effect; but the Legislature has not so provided.  On the contrary, the Tax Law ( &sect; 249-r) expressly excludes real property outside this State, and it does not provide that a partnership interest shall be considered as an intangible interest in personal property.  Accordingly, in valuing a New York decedent's interest in a partnership, for New York estate tax purposes, the value of his interest in partnership realty situated in Connecticut should be excluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Decedent, who was domiciled in New York, formed an equal partnership in real estate with his son.  They acquired real estate in Connecticut by deeds to decedent and his said son as &quot;copartners in business under the firm name of&quot; father and son.  Only one portion was sold by them.  Up to the time of decedent's death, Connecticut had not adopted the Uniform Partnership Law. Under Connecticut law and common law, decedent was an equal tenant in common with his son.  His will bequeathed &quot;all of my interest in the partnership * * * to my son&quot;, naming said partner. He left his residuary estate to both of his sons.  The executors paid a Connecticut succession tax, on, among other assets, decedent's half interest in said Connecticut&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  realty, which half interest was valued at $ 163,750.  The rest of decedent's interest in the partnership was valued at $ 38,892.89, as shown on the partnership books and on the Federal estate tax return.  But said $ 163,750 shall be excluded from decedent's gross taxable estate in New York (Tax Law, &sect; 249-r).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Assuming, without deciding, that the partners could effect an equitable conversion of the Connecticult realty into personalty, the evidence does not support any finding that they did.  The partnership agreement is silent as to any accountability of the surviving partner to the representative of the deceased partner for the value of the Connecticut real estate. There was no dealing in real estate as merchandise.  There was only a single sale.  The fact that the value of the realty was carried on the partnership books as a partnership asset is not inconsistent with the doctrine that it retained its character as real estate with title vested in the two grantees as tenants in common subject only to their partnership equities.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant applied for an order granting him permission to inspect the grand jury minutes upon which the indictment was found, or in the alternative, for a dismissal of the indictment based upon the grand jury minutes. The indictment charged defendant and three co-defendants with the commission of the crime of murder in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A written confession was taken from defendant after the police had refused to allow an attorney, retained for him by his family while he was in custody, to see or speak with him. It was for that reason that the court of appeals reversed his conviction in the first trial. Defendant claimed that an inspection of the grand jury minutes would show a legal insufficiency of evidence to convict him of the crime charged. The only evidence introduced before the grand jury implicating defendant was his written confession. The court was charged with judicial knowledge and notice of the fact that defendant's written confession was not &quot;legal evidence.&quot; The court found that the fact that sufficient testimony was adduced on the trial to warrant defendant's conviction did not validate an indictment, which would be good if such additional proof had been presented to the grand jury. Defendant had a constitutional right to have an indictment found against him based only upon legal evidence constitutionally obtained. The court of appeals ruled that the evidence used against him, and which was the sole basis for his indictment by the grand jury, was unconstitutionally obtained from him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the indictment and withheld signing an order for a period of 15 days to afford the district attorney an opportunity to present the case to another grand jury.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An indictment, founded upon a written confession, held, after trial and appeal, to be inadmissible, must be dismissed even though sufficient evidence was adduced on the trial, apart from the confession, to warrant defendant's conviction.  The trial testimony does not validate said indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A strict construction of section 251 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that the Grand Jury ought to find an indictment when all the evidence before them, unexplained or uncontradicted, warrants a conviction, would necessitate holding the indictment sufficient because nothing indicated that the confession was inadmissible. However, section 251 must be construed with section 249 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which provides that a Grand Jury can receive only &quot;legal evidence&quot;.  Accordingly, protection of the rights of moving defendant requires liberal construction.  Moreover, irrespective of the statute, the court has inherent power to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entertain a motion to set aside an indictment based on insufficient evidence. </SPAN></P>

The board contended that it had the authority to call the meeting pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2007 and that petitioner failed to exhaust the administrative remedies.

The Commission rejected the proposal, so petitioners sought an order directing the Commission to make the change. The court granted the petition, holding that the board of supervisors had authority to exempt the positions and that the Commission was required to approve the action. The court noted that N.Y. Civ.

County Law &sect; 526(3) stated that the county clerk could appoint deputies authorized to act generally for and in the place of their principal.

Subdivision 3 of section 526 of the County Law (as added by L. 1962, ch. 626) empowered a County Clerk to appoint and remove such additional deputies &quot;authorized to act generally for and in the place of their principal&quot; as shall be authorized by resolution of the Board of Supervisors. Acting pursuant thereto, the Board of Supervisors&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Suffolk County by resolution created three positions of Deputy County Clerk, all in the exempt class and abolished three positions with similar titles in the competitive class. Section 41 of the Civil Service Law listed, as positions in the exempt class, the deputies of principal executive officers &quot;authorized by law to act generally for and in place of their principals&quot;.  By the Legislature's use of the quoted language in subdivision 3 of section 526 of the County Law, it intended that the positions be exempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In this case, it was within the power of the Legislature to delegate to the Board of Supervisors the power to legislate as to the number of positions of Deputy County Clerk, the county might require.  What was done here was a reasonable exercise of the legislative power to classify positions under the civil service and one which does not violate the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Neither the State Civil Service Commission nor the Suffolk County Civil Service Commission had any discretionary power to veto the authorized legislative action of the Board of Supervisors.</SPAN></P>

That one petitioner has, under a provisional appointment, occupied a position with the title of Deputy County Clerk&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the competitive class does not affect the result.  Nor is it significant that the competitive position is to be abolished and that he, without taking a qualifying examination, may be appointed to the new position.  The legislative classification prevails and has removed his position from the control of the Civil Service Commission.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The infants were injured while playing within the state's abandoned building. The court granted judgment for the state in the infants' personal injury lawsuit. The court held that the infants were trespassers as a matter of law. Although the state might have known that persons including children were entering onto the property, such knowledge did not constitute an invitation to such persons to so continue. The state had a common-law duty to infant trespassers to refrain from inflicting willful, wanton, or intentional injuries and not to create a trap or maintain an inherently dangerous article without the exercise of a high degree of care to prevent foreseeable injury to others. The court concluded that the evidence did not warrant the imposition of liability upon the state. The injuries sustained by the infants were caused by nonstructural defects, and there was no proof of any willful, wanton, or intentional acts on the state's part. There was evidence to show the state's attempts to keep the building closed. Furthermore, the state governed its municipalities and a municipality could not encroach directly or indirectly upon the sovereign powers of the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners filed a declaratory judgment action against defendants, the city and others, seeking a declaration on the validity of an amendment to a zoning ordinance, which created a high rise housing district. The owners had alleged that the amendment was not in accordance with a comprehensive or a well-considered plan, that it was confiscatory, and that it was enacted pursuant to defective procedures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city amended a building zone ordinance, rezoning an area to create a municipal high rise housing district. The owners of rezoned parcels and of parcels adjacent to the rezoned area filed a declaratory judgment action against defendants alleging that the amendment was not in accordance with a well-considered plan, that it was confiscatory, and that it was enacted under defective procedures. The court held that: (1) while inconsistency existed, in that the height and the population density of the proposed use did not conform to restrictions elsewhere in the city, inconsistency alone did not show that a plan was not well considered, and because the rezoning was for a general welfare purpose, the owners had, but failed, to convincingly demonstrate irrationality; (2) the amendment was confiscatory because the owners were deprived of any beneficial use of their land, as the district created allowed only a single use, for municipal housing; and (3) the property description in the notice of hearing setting forth the nature of the change provided insufficient notice because the description did not give an average reader reasonable warning that his property might be affected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a judgment declaring that the amendment to the zoning ordinance was invalidly adopted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- zoning amendment creating Municipal High Rise Housing District in which only that one use is allowed is confiscatory, since condemnation and just compensation are postponed indefinitely -- moreover, notice of hearing and zone amendment described zone erroneously -- but project is comprehensive and well considered and promotes general welfare, and errors can be corrected by Common Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An amendment to the City of Glen Cove Building Zone Ordinance, creating a Municipal High Rise Housing District, is adjudged invalid because confiscatory and because not properly enacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The ordinance allows only one use in the district it creates: municipal housing. The owners are thus deprived of any beneficial use of their property -- the classic example of an unconstitutional taking.  In such a situation, the city must provide for condemnation and just compensation now, not at some indefinite future time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The published notice of hearing before the Planning Board described the proposed zone so erroneously as to make it impossible to tell whether certain lots -- lots 563, 589, 580, 27 and 47 -- were or were not included.  Some owners were thus&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unaware that their properties were to be rezoned and they did not attend the hearing.  It is immaterial that the Planning Board recommended disapproval of the rezoning; the City Council overruled the board.  And the ordinance, as finally adopted, contained practically the same erroneous description of the zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. However, a public housing project is clearly in furtherance of the general welfare (N. Y. Const., art. XVIII; Public Housing Law, &sect; 2).  The proposed height (8 stories) and population density (40 apartments per acre) contrast with the restrictions elsewhere in the city (height 3 stories; population density 16 apartments per acre); but the General City Law ( &sect; 20, subd. 24) provides that &quot;the regulations in one or more districts may differ from those in other districts.&quot; The evidence shows, and the court's view confirms, that the rezoned property fronts on an arterial highway and that the land behind it rises sharply, cutting it off from residentially zoned properties above and behind it.  It has not been shown that governmental or commercial facilities will be overburdened by the increased population density or that the increased height will overburden facilities or constitute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an eyesore.  The whole plan is comprehensive and well considered.  It will be delayed because of the above-stated errors, which, however, can be corrected by the Common Council.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner licensee filed an action under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 to review a decision respondent commissioner of the department of motor vehicles. The licensee sought, in the nature of a writ of mandamus, an order directing the commissioner to permit him and others similarly-situated to obliterate or to cover over a certain inscription on the metal license plates to be issued to him, upon the registration of his vehicles, by the commissioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A licensee owned motor vehicles and a trailer, which were required to be registered with and to bear metal registration plates issued by the commissioner. The plates issued had the inscription &quot;World's Fair,&quot; referencing the forthcoming World's Fair, which was operated by a private nonprofit corporation. The licensee filed an action under art. 78 for an order to compel the commissioner to permit him to obliterate or to cover over the inscription, alleging that the issuance of such plates was unconstitutional and that it compelled him to use private property for advertising purposes on behalf of a private corporation, without compensation. The court held that: (1) although the commissioner had discretion, which should only be exercised in consistency with the purpose of the plates, with respect to the design of the plates, he had no authority to include the inscription &quot;World's Fair&quot; thereon or to issue plates containing such inscription; and (2) the licensee and other vehicle owners, who were required to register their vehicle in New York, were legally entitled to the issuance of a proper registration plate, and the commissioner was required to issue such a plate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the licensee's petition for mandamus relief to the extent of requiring the commissioner to issue to the licensee a registration plate containing distinctive numbers to be assigned to the licensee's vehicles.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 2 of section 402 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law empowers the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles to prescribe the material, form, design and dimensions of registration plates for motor vehicles and to set forth a distinguishing number or other identification mark.  Such grant does not give the Commissioner power to prescribe that such plates for 1964 contain the inscription &quot;World's Fair&quot; or to issue such plates. &quot;New York World's Fair 1964/1965, Inc.,&quot; is a private, nonprofit corporation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nursing home operator sought a declaratory judgment that the hospital commissioner's refusal to renew the nursing home operator's license was illegal, unauthorized, invalid, and unconstitutional. The hospital commissioner refused to renew the license until the nursing home, which was operated as a limited partnership, was changed to a general partnership. The nursing home operator contended that the applicable licensing statute did not prohibit a limited partnership from being licensed to operate a private nursing home. The court held that: (1) the spirit and intent of the applicable statutes were sufficiently clear to evince a legislative intent to require that all people forming the licensee of a nursing home bore the responsibility of a licensee vis-a-vis the department of hospitals as well as the patients in the home; and (2) the evil of allowing the treatment of the elderly sick and infirm to fall into the hands of unscrupulous operators removed from public regulation or control and immune from personal liability could easily be seen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operation of a private nursing home by a limited partnership violates subdivisions (c) and (d) of section 2.01 of the Hospital Code, Part I (Proprietary Nursing Homes) of the Board of Hospitals, City of New York, which define a licensee as &quot;persons who operate and who are responsible for a home&quot; and define an applicant as &quot;persons who intend to operate and be responsible for a home&quot;.  Under these definitions, only the general partners can meet the requirements of an applicant for such a license. Accordingly, the complaint, in an action by a limited partnership for a declaration that the acts of the Commissioner of Hospitals -- refusing to issue a renewal license to operate their private nursing home unless the operation of the business was changed to a general partnership -- were illegal, is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law art. 25 was constitutional, as well as incidental relief. Defendant producer by counterclaim sought a declaration that N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 294(2)(d), an apple marketing order, and a consulting contract were unconstitutional or illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner was charged by the legislature with the promotion of agricultural products produced within the State. He was authorized to issue marketing orders towards that end. After a referendum of apple growers, in accordance with N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 294(2), the Commissioner made an apple marketing order. The producer contended that &sect; 294(2)(d) was an unconstitutional delegation of power because of the referendum provision. The court found that was not the case because the decision to hold a referendum or to issue a marketing order was vested in the Commissioner. Furthermore, it was not necessary to for the legislative declaration in N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 292 to state that that the apple industry was of paramount importance. There was also no constitutional defect in the assessment against growers under N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 294(2)(d) because the funds were segregated for a specific purpose. Finally, consulting contracts were not illegal because N.Y. State Fin. Law &sect; 174 dealt with goods and not with services. The court held that N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law art. 25 was constitutional and dismissed the producer's counterclaim.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Agriculture -- marketing of agricultural products -- apple marketing order -- paragraph (d) of subdivision (2) of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 294 of Agriculture and Markets Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> empowering Commissioner of Agriculture to issue commodity marketing order is constitutional; no unlawful delegation of power to growers is involved -- letting of contracts to growers' associations without bidding is proper -- no payment of State funds to such associations is involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Article 25 of the Agriculture and Markets Law provides for the marketing of agricultural products and subdivision (2) of section 294 of the Agriculture and Markets Law, contained in such article, empowers the Commissioner of Agriculture to issue marketing orders and by paragraph (d) of such subdivision he is empowered to administer and enforce any marketing order and to prepare a budget for the administration and operating costs, including advertising and sales promotion when required and to provide for the collection of such necessary fees to defray such costs and expenses from each person engaged in the production, processing, distributing &quot;or&quot; handling of any commodity. The Commissioner issued a marketing order covering apples after&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a referendum showed that 75% plus of those participating voted in favor thereof.  Paragraph (d) of subdivision 2 of section 294 is constitutional.  There is no unlawful delegation of power to apple growers. The discretion to issue a marketing order is solely that of plaintiff commissioner even though he prefers that a petition for such an order be submitted, as a procedural step, before issuing such order.  The delegation of power is to plaintiff which defendant concedes is proper.  The referendum among apple growers was conducted after such adequate notice as was feasible was given.  That fees are levied only against growers rather than processors, distributors or handlers is proper since the statute uses the disjunctive &quot;or&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The letting of contracts with growers' associations without competitive bidding did not violate section 174 of the State Finance Law which deals with commodities and not services.  Competitive bidding for the services here involved was not feasible.</SPAN></P>

Subdivision (8) of section 294 of the Agriculture and Markets Law&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  expressly declares that the funds raised from the growers are not State funds.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenants deposited their rental moneys in to the court rather than pay it to the landlord. The court considered the issue of whether the landlord was entitled to his rents, or the tenants were entitled to the return of their rent money which they had deposited in court, by reason of the proof that they offered. By the virtual concession of landlord's counsel and the proof adduced, the court found that what was described as &quot;homes&quot; were in effect &quot;pig-sties,&quot; and not only unfit for human habitation but dangerous to their lives, safety and health. The court concluded that counsel for the landlord was entitled to a ruling on a suggestion that he made that N.Y. Real. Prop. Acts. Law &sect;&sect; 143-b and 755 were in derogation of the common law and that an earlier opinion was not the law. The court rejected such suggestion and repeated that the new statutes enacted were not in derogation of the common law, but in addition thereto.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for conspiracy to commit murder, criminally buying and receiving stolen property, and criminally concealing and withholding stolen property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The revolvers were to be used by defendant and others in committing various crimes, including murder. Defendant argued that placing the electronic device within his premises without his knowledge constituted an intrusion that violated U.S. Const. amend IV, and that N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 813-a, empowering a court to issue an order permitting the attachment of an electronic device, was repugnant to U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court held that: (1) the revolver's were found in a co-defendant's truck pursuant to a search warrant; (2) as the validity of the search warrant had been upheld in the co-defendant's motion to vacate the search warrant and to suppress the revolvers, that decision was res judicata as to defendant; (3) if defendant's motion were granted, the State would be precluded from a proper presentation of the charges in the indictment; and (4) the State, in this instance, was entitled to the benefit of the doubt on a question of law, particularly of constitutional law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The milk processor contended that the Commissioner was not entitled to an injunction to compel payment into an escrow account because &sect; 258-b(7) violated U.S. Const. amend.

The court granted injunctive relief because &sect; 258-b(7) was merely an extension of legislation that had previously been determined to be constitutional. The fact that it provided the Commissioner with discretion was not a denial of equal protection under the law, and the standard by which security was required was applicable to all milk processors including cooperatives.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action to compel defendant, a milk dealer, to deposit funds in an escrow account to be maintained to secure payment for milk purchased by defendant, subdivision 7 of section 258-b of the Agriculture and Markets Law, which authorizes plaintiff Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets to require milk dealers to establish such accounts as a protection to milk producers, is constitutional and does not deny due process of law to defendant nor equal protection of the laws.  The subdivision empowers the Commissioner to require such escrow account as security in addition to the requirement that dealers file bonds where he feels that a bond alone will not afford adequate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  security. Equal protection is not denied defendant because more than one method of providing security was required of defendant.

The guardian filed an action to prohibit return of the infants to the parents on the ground that their safety would be endangered and also sought custody of the infants. The guardian alleged that the compact was unconstitutional because it permitted an ex parte determination of whether the infants should be returned. The administrator filed a motion to dismiss the petition. The court acknowledged that due process concerns existed but held that the infants were not aggrieved. The constitutionality of the compact could not be challenged. The infants received an adjournment of the proceedings and would receive a hearing at which they could develop the facts regarding their welfare prior to a final determination.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Two sisters, aged 17 and 15, left their parents' home in Massachusetts and went to the home of the older sister in Westchester County, New York.  Pursuant to the Interstate Compact on Juveniles (which was executed on behalf of New York State pursuant to L. 1955, ch. 155), their parents obtained a requisition from a Judge of a Massachusetts court, demanding the return of the infants; and said requisition was presented by their counsel to our Family Court, Westchester County.  Under article IV of said compact, our court may appoint counsel or guardian&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ad litem for such infants, and may allow a reasonable time in which to test the legality of the proceeding.  Said older sister, as guardian ad litem of the infants, has instituted this proceeding in the Supreme Court, Westchester County, for an order in the nature of prohibition. She asserts that the infants' health, safety and morals will be endangered if they are returned to their parents, and she seeks to have their custody awarded to her.  But these issues may be determined by our Family Court (N. Y. Const., art. VI, &sect; 13).  In the Family Court, the infants will receive a full hearing, in which their best interests must prevail even over the rights of their parents and the previous determination of the Massachusetts court and any inconsistent requirement of the compact. Accordingly, this prohibition proceeding is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Interstate Compact on Juveniles (L. 1955, ch. 155) does not interfere with the constitutional jurisdiction of our Supreme Court or of our Family Court (N. Y. Const., art. VI, &sect;&sect; 6, 7, 13, 30).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Interstate Compact on Juveniles (L. 1955, ch. 155) does not deal with a subject which requires the approval of Congress (U. S. Const., art.  I, &sect; 10). &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nor does it deny to the infants the equal protection of the laws, or abridge their privileges and immunities (U. S. Const., 14th Amdt.).  Nor does it deny them constitutional due process of law, if the provision in article IV of the compact which provides that our court &quot;may&quot; allow a test of the legality of the proceeding is construed, as it properly should be, to require such a test.  In any event, these infants are now being allowed to test the legality of the proceeding, and they will be given a full hearing on the merits; hence it is unnecessary to determine whether article IV of the compact should be thus construed.  Nor is it necessary at this time to rule on petitioner's contention that the compact unconstitutionally gives judicial powers to the New York State Administrator of the compact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Whether section 913-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, concerning wayward minors, has any application to the facts of this case will be for the Family Court to determine.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town sought to enjoin defendant property owners from continuing a nonconforming use in violation of the town's zoning ordinance. As an affirmative defense, the owners asserted that the ordinance was unconstitutional because its enactment did not meet the requirements of N.Y. Town Law &sect; 264. The owners also asserted that any nonconforming use existed prior to the ordinance's enactment and did not extend after that point in time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning ordinance, as adopted, made the use of the owners' parcels of land as &quot;junk yards&quot; nonconforming uses, and proscribed their termination within three years of the date of the ordinance. At issue was whether the procedure followed by the town clerk in inserting a newspaper proof of the ordinance into the minute book complied with the requisites of &sect; 264, which mandated that every zoning ordinance was to be entered in the minutes of the town board. Finding that such a procedure did, in fact, comply with the statutory requisites, the court granted the town's request for relief. The court did not believe that it was the legislative intent to have the ordinance written down word for word in the clerk's minutes. As long as a copy of the ordinance was attached physically to the minutes and the accompanying map was posted on the clerk's bulletin board, both available for inspection by the public, a compliance, in substance, with &sect; 264 had occurred. Furthermore, defendants, having ignored the existence of the ordinance and having continued to pile more junks on the property, could not now be heard to complain of the &quot;hardship&quot; imposed by being required to remove the junks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court directed the submission of an order, without costs, that provided for an 18-month period for the removal of autos and junk from the subject parcels of real property. The decree was also to limit the town's relief to the cessation of the nonconforming uses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- Town Clerk complied with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Town Law ( &sect; 264</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) when Town Board adopted Zoning Ordinance by inserting newspaper proof thereof into minute book -- elimination of nonconforming uses within three years as provided for therein is constitutional -- defendants maintained automobile junk yard on their premises; at time ordinance was adopted, their hardship was slight; defendants cannot complain of multiplied hardship because they ignored ordinance -- defendants acquired no vested rights to continue business despite Zoning Ordinance -- defendants' use must cease and junked automobiles removed within 18 months -- proceeding for penalties against defendants barred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 264 of the Town Law provides that every Zoning Ordinance adopted by a town shall be &quot;entered&quot; in the minutes of the Town Board. A Town's Clerk complied with such section by inserting a newspaper proof of the Zoning Regulations into the minute book. It was not the legislative intent that the Zoning Ordinance be written down word for word as long as a copy was attached physically to the minutes, and the accompanying map was posted on the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clerk's bulletin board and available for inspection by the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Zoning Ordinance, effective April 13, 1953, made use of defendants' land as an automobile junk yard a nonconforming use and provided that such use be terminated within three years.  Elimination of nonconforming uses is constitutional if reasonably provided for without producing too great a hardship on a property owner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In April, 1953, defendants had 150 junked automobiles on the west side of the highway and 50 on the east side of the highway. There would have been slight hardship in removing those automobiles but defendants elected to ignore the ordinance and they estimate 2,500 are now on the premises.  Defendants cannot complain of the hardship which they multiplied. In any event, the expense of removing the junked automobiles, using their figures, does not establish hardship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The maintenance of 200 automobiles between 1951 and 1953 is not so substantial a business interest, nor has it been built up over such a period of years as to have acquired for defendants a vested right to continue despite the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The present use of the easterly parcel is an extension of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a nonconforming use. The present use of the westerly parcel is the continuation of a nonconforming use, both of which must cease and the automobiles removed within an 18-month period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The town, by the decree, will be prevented from seeking relief by way of future proceedings against defendants under the penalties and remedies provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. </SPAN></P>

Respondents filed a motion to dismiss the landowners' amended complaint and for summary judgment. The court denied the motions. The court held that the petition could not be maintained under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 because it sought review of a legislative determination, but that its improper form was not grounds for dismissal of the action and that, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 103(c), the court was authorized to make any order necessary for its prosecution. The court further held that the petition stated a cause of action based on the superintendent acting in excess of his authority or in a manner not authorized by law. The court concluded that the action could not have been decided on summary judgment because an issue of fact remained as to whether the superintendent had improperly delegated his power of eminent domain to a federal highway administrator. The court ordered that the proceeding continue as an action for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father filed an action seeking to compel respondents to provide home teaching to the infant, who suffered from a heart condition. On an order to show cause, the court ordered respondents to provide home teaching to the infant, holding that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 1709(24) as applied to the case was not unconstitutional as violative of N.Y. Const. art. XI, &sect; 4, and that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 1709(24) required respondents to furnish the home teaching requested. The court found that &sect; 1709(24), which required boards of education to provide home teaching to physically handicapped children, benefited all children, including those attending parochial school. The court noted that it need not determine whether the infant was &quot;physically handicapped&quot; under &sect; 1709(24) because respondents conceded that fact. The court further found that providing home teaching to a parochial student did not violate N.Y. Const. art. XI, &sect; 4, which prohibited state aid to a school wholly or in part under the control or direction of a religious denomination, because the benefits of home teaching would inure solely to the student and would be of no financial aid to the parochial school.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The key question on the motion for confirmation was the effect of the resignation of one of the three appointed commissioners prior to the taking of testimony. The court found that: (1) the hearings and the provisions of &sect; 64 of the Suffolk County Improvement Act were violative of N.Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 7(b); (2) it had been mandatory that there be no less than three commissioners at the hearings; (3) the constitutional statutory provision for the three commissioners was jurisdictional and could not be waived; and (4) any majority decision regarding compensation in condemnation cases had to be made at a meeting at which all three commissioners had been present.</SPAN></P>

Section 64 of the Suffolk County Improvement Act is, to that extent, unconstitutional and void.  Of course, a majority may make awards, but all must be present.  A final report by only two Commissioners, one having resigned before any testimony was taken, will not be confirmed.  </SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect; 974, and for possessing policy slips. Defendant, by his motion, argued that N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 177(1) was unconstitutional because it circumvented the intent of the fourth amendment by affording police officers an opportunity to search and seize without any sufficient warrant or basis. He further claimed that N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 813-c was unconstitutional by compelling him to controvert the search warrant, which was in violation of his rights against self-incrimination. The court declined to declare these statutes unconstitutional because every statute had a presumption of constitutionality. The court also noted that the state legislature in exercising its police power had the right and duty to enact such laws for the protection of the people in the state. Finally, the court declined to grant defendant's motion on the remaining requests. The court found that sufficient probable cause had supported the search warrant and concluded that suppression of evidence was inappropriate in this case.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed that the former wife, upon obtaining a divorce, became disqualified from sharing in the estate as a surviving spouse, and the separation agreement constituted a complete release and waiver of any other statutory right to participate in the distribution of the testator's property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 484-h after a 16-year old girl purchased a copy of &quot;Fanny Hill.&quot; Defendants moved to dismiss the information on the grounds that &sect; 484-h inhibited freedom of expression in violation of U.S. Const. amends.

The court denied the motions and found each defendant guilty, holding that the book was obscene and that &sect; 484-h was a valid exercise of the state's police power to protect minors. The judges found that the publication was indecent and violated a valid statute enacted to protect the morals of young people.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. &quot;Memoirs of A Woman of Pleasure&quot; is a book which, in the language of section 484-h of the Penal Law banning the sale or advertising for sale of such books to minors under 18 years of age, &quot;exploits, is devoted to, or is principally made up of descriptions of illicit sex or sexual immorality&quot; and defendants who sold such book to a minor under 18 years of age are guilty of violating the section.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company instituted the action for a declaratory judgment against defendant city on the grounds that the New York City Commercial Rent or Occupancy Tax chapter 257 (1963) and New York City, N.Y., Local Law 38 (1963), which imposed taxes, were void, unconstitutional and ineffectual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New York City Commercial Rent or Occupancy Tax chapter 257 (1963) enabled any city having a population of 1,000,000 or more to impose and collect taxes on rent or occupancy. The company contended that the tax was unconstitutional, based principally on the grounds that it imposed a real estate tax, which exceeded the limit set forth in New York Const. art. VIII, &sect; 10 and imposed an ad valorem tax in violation of N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 3. On review, the court disagreed. The tax did not constitute a tax on real estate, and therefore did not violate the constitution. The tax was neither an ad valorem tax nor an excise tax levied solely because of ownership or possession. The company further alleged that the tax violated the &quot;Due Process&quot; and &quot;Equal Protection&quot; clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court disagreed and held that the power of taxation was legislative and the legislature's determination was final.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York City local law requiring every tenant who uses or occupies premises for any trade, business, profession, vocation, or commercial activity to pay a tax of 2 1/2% of his base rent if such base rent does not exceed $ 2,500 a year, or of 5% of his base rent if such base rent exceeds $ 2,500 a year (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; L46-1.0 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.), and the enabling statute (L. 1963, ch. 257), are valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A tax on a leasehold is not considered to be a real property tax within the meaning of the State Constitution (art.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The &quot;due process&quot; and &quot;equal protection&quot; provisions of the United States Constitution (14th Amdt.) are not violated by the facts that the tax applies only to cities having a population of 1,000,000 or more, and that the tax is imposed at different rates depending on whether the tenant's rent is more or less than $ 2,500 a year, and that the tax is not imposed on an owner of premises who is also a lessee therein.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, group of individuals and a corporation, who held themselves out to be &quot;landscape architects,&quot; filed an action against defendant New York Board of Examiners, seeking a judgment declaring that, N.Y.

The court held that (1) a justiciable controversy existed because plaintiffs held themselves out to be landscape architects and a declaration of plaintiffs' rights was essential to their ability to earn a livelihood; (2) although certain activities of those required by the statute to be licensed did not touch upon the health, safety and welfare of the community, the statute's regulation of aesthetics was a proper exercise of the police power and the restrictions imposed by the statute did not present an arbitrary or irrational method of achieving a proper legislative goal; and (3) the statute was not an unlawful delegation of legislative authority and did not deprive plaintiffs of property without due process of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Licenses -- landscape architects -- justiciable controversy exists between plaintiffs, holding themselves out as landscape architects, and defendant, which refused to license them under article 148 of Education Law, warranting declaration of their rights -- no unlawful delegation of legislative power given to Board of Examiners -- article 148 does not violate due process of law; article not vague -- regulation of activities of landscape architects is proper exercise of police power; activities affect public health -- article 148 is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Article 148 of the Education Law ( &sect;&sect; 7320-7332) prohibits, on and after July 1, 1961, the practice of landscape architecture, as defined in the statute, and one's holding himself out to be a &quot;landscape architect&quot; without a license having first been issued by the Education Department (&sect; 7321) upon certification by the Board of Examiners established by the statute (&sect; 7322).  A violation thereof is declared to be a misdemeanor, punishable by fine and imprisonment (&sect; 7328).  A justiciable controversy exists between plaintiffs, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  who hold themselves out to be landscape architects and perform the work included in the definition contained in the statute, and defendant, which declined to grant them licenses. Plaintiffs are aggrieved parties and entitled to a declaration of their rights under article 148.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The discretion vested in the Board of Examiners under section 7323 to grant or refuse admission to a licensing examination and to grant or deny an application for a license does not constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative authority, despite the use of phrases in the statute that proposed licensees have educational backgrounds or experience &quot;of a grade and character acceptable to the board&quot;.  The Legislature here specifically defined the cases in which the board is to exercise its discretion and what factors are to be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Article 148 of the Education Law does not deprive plaintiffs of their property without due process of law.  The activities regulated are those which are restricted to the furnishing of trained professional services for consultation, research, planning, design, etc., for the development, preservation and enhancement of land, as distinguished from the furnishing of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  labor, equipment, or supplies whereby the development of land areas is to be realized.  The statute sets forth a clear standard of conduct giving notice to one concerned with or engaged in the activities regulated as to what acts are criminal.  The statute is neither vague nor uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The interests of public health, safety and welfare require the regulation of the activities performed by a landscape architect. The landscape architect is directly responsible for matters concerning the health and safety of the community, including the proper drainage of highways, industrial sites and housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Article 148 is constitutional as a valid exercise of the police power of the State.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to 1959 N.Y. Laws 685-688 (the enabling acts), plaintiff claimants sought to recover damages from defendant State, alleging that the State was negligent in connection with an automobile accident. The State's attorney-general filed a motion to dismiss the claims upon the ground that the enabling acts were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the claimants was driving the automobile that collided with a State National Guard truck that was towing a cannon. The other three claimants were passengers in the automobile. The accident took place approximately nine years before the enabling acts were passed. Subsequent to the passage of the enabling acts, the claimants timely filed their claims and prosecuted them with due diligence. The evidence presented at the trial on the claims revealed that the accident was proximately caused by the negligent operation of the National Guard truck and that the claimants were free of any contributory negligence. The court denied the attorney-general's motion to dismiss the claims, noting that the State could constitutionally recognize and provide redress for its liability for past obligations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the attorney-general's motion to dismiss the claims and held that the State's negligence was the proximate cause of the automobile accident.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Court of Claim -- enabling act -- at time when claims against State for negligence of members of State militia were not within jurisdiction of Court of Claims, claimants sustained injuries in accident with member of State militia; thereafter and within three years after claims arose State waived its immunity for torts committed by State militia as to torts thereafter committed; Legislature passed acts enabling claimants to make claims; motion to dismiss claims on ground that acts are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> denied -- laws waiving rights of State retrospectively are constitutional -- when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 8-a of Court of Claims Act</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> waiving State's immunity as to militia was passed, claims of claimants were not barred; passage of section tolled </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> of Limitations -- passage of enabling acts not prohibited by Constitution (art III, &sect; 19) -- tolling of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> continued until passage of enabling acts; enabling acts properly enacted by Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Claimants were injured as the result of the negligence of a New York State National Guardsman who was so operating a truck as to cause it to collide with a vehicle operated by one claimant in which the other claimants were passengers. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The accident occurred on August 19, 1950, at which time the State had not waived its sovereign immunity from liability for torts of members of the organized militia of the State.  When claimants sought to recover their damages, the Court of Claims dismissed their claims on May 15, 1951 on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction of them.  Section 8-a of the Court of Claims Act became effective on May 1, 1953 and waived the State's immunity for torts committed thereafter by the militia. Claimants refiled their claims pursuant to separate enabling acts passed in 1959.  The State's motion to dismiss the claims on the ground that the enabling acts were private bills and unconstitutional is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The State may constitutionally pass retrospective laws waiving or impairing its own rights, and it may impose upon itself new liabilities with respect to transactions already past.  The Legislature can provide redress for the State's liability for past obligations equally with its right to waive its immunity for claims to arise in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. When section 8-a of the Court of Claims Act became effective on May 1, 1953, the Statute of Limitations had not expired as to these claims but the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  section gave claimants no forum in which to present them since the section applied only to torts thereafter committed.  The Statute of Limitations was thus tolled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Since the statutory limitation had not expired, section 19 of article III of the Constitution prohibiting the allowance of claims barred by lapse of time did not prohibit them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The tolling of the statute continued until the passage of the special enabling acts under which the claims are now presented, the enabling acts giving claimants a forum.  The Legislature has a right to recognize the State's moral obligation to pay a claim and to provide a forum.  While the Legislature may not sanction a gift of public moneys for private purposes, it may acknowledge the justice of private claims against the State and provide for the audit and allowance of such claims and the propriety of its action is not subject to court review.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother filed a N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 545 motion to extend the father's order of support of the parties' child until the child reached the age of 21 years. The father objected to the motion on the ground that the enactment of &sect; 545 constituted an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father had been ordered to pay support to his child, which was born out of wedlock, until the child reached 16 years of age. The order was issued by a criminal court in a prior filiation proceeding. On September 1, 1962, the Family Court Act became effective. Section 545 provided in part that a father was liable for the support of an infant born out of wedlock until the child attained 21 years of age and for good cause shown a longer time with no limitations. The father argued that &sect; 545, which raised the age of support to 21 years, was an ex post facto law. He asserted because the action was a criminal proceeding his rights were fixed by the law in effect at the time of the occurrence, which was prior to the adoption of &sect; 545. The mother's petition for extended support was granted. The court held that &sect; 545 was not an ex post facto law. The court stated that a filiation proceeding was not readily categorized as either a civil or a criminal action; it was a creature sui generis, to which special rules applied. The ex post facto prohibition applied only to penal statutes.&nbsp;Section 545 was not a penal statute because paternity proceedings were not criminal proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's application to extend the order of support until the child reached 21 years of age was granted. The court also increased the father's weekly support obligation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. All paternity proceedings pending in the New York City Court of Special Sessions, together with the court's continuing jurisdiction to modify the orders and to increase or decrease the amounts of support, were transferred on September 1, 1962 to the Family Court (L. 1962, ch. 688).  Said Court of Special Sessions had had power to order support until the child's sixteenth birthday, and to continue the order until age 21 or longer for good cause shown, whereas the Family Court has power to order support until age 21, and to continue the order beyond that age for good cause shown, and likewise has continuing jurisdiction to modify its orders of support ( N. Y. City Crim. Cts. Act, &sect;&sect; 72, 69, subd. 2; Family Ct. Act, &sect;&sect; 451, 545).  In this case, the child for whose support the father had been ordered by the Court of Special Sessions to pay $ 8 a week was still under age 16 on September 1, 1962.  The Family Court, on petition of the mother after the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  child reached age 16, extends the order until age 21.  Petitioner may, if she wishes, have a hearing as to the amount.  Respondent may, if the child becomes self-supporting, apply for relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The new statute ( Family Ct. Act, &sect; 545) is not ex post facto or oppressive, and orders thereunder are made under due process of law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner commenced a habeas corpus proceeding alleging that his release on bail posted for the federal charge granted him a vested right to be free which was infringed by state parole officers and that his retaking and confinement infringed on his constitutional right against double jeopardy. The court dismissed the prisoner's writ, holding that the parole officers properly revoked the prisoner's privilege of parole when he was arrested on the federal charge. The court noted that the prisoner presented no evidence regarding the illegality of his federal arrest. The court found that whether the federal arrest was based on an illegal search and seizure was not relevant because the parole officers did not rely on the arrest to convict the prisoner of a crime. The court determined that the prisoner remained within the legal custody of respondent warden while he was on parole pursuant to N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 213. The court noted that parole was a privilege accorded to the prisoner and that it could have been withdrawn within the absolute and unreviewable discretion of the Parole Board.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

Section 216 is not unconstitutional and is not unconstitutional in its application to relator.  The arrest of the parolee, while he enjoyed the privilege of going outside the prison walls, was ample basis for the action of the parole officer. That no Parole Board issued the warrant for his retaking making it retroactive to the date of his retaking is unconsequential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Federal arrest was not illegal.  Whether the Federal arrest was or was not bottomed upon an illegal search and seizure is of no moment in this proceeding.

It has interests which will be affected by the outcome of the action and may be bound by the judgment within the meaning of section 1012 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.  Although the contract vendee will by intervention seek to invalidate the rezoning which it sought, since, in approving the change, the town imposed conditions which the contract vendee alleges may create additional obstacles and necessitate further delays in the use of property, such consideration is outweighed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant members of the Board of Health of the City of New York filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings dismissing plaintiff association's amended complaint, and the association filed a cross motion for dismissal of the board's amended answer. The association's action sought to declare unconstitutional sections of New York City, N.Y., Health Code art. 47 that regulated day care services and to restrain the enforcement thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association alleged that the challenged regulations unconstitutionally usurped legislative functions beyond the board's jurisdiction of the board, that they discriminated against private institutions, and that they were vague, illusory, and did not define their standards. The court granted the board's motion and denied the association's cross motion, holding that its constitutional attack was groundless. The challenged regulations did not conflict with regulations issued by the state department of education, with which compliance was voluntary. The board was authorized to promulgate regulations to protect and promote public health and had the power to enact local code provisions additional to state enactments. The provisions came within both the scope of the police power and the protection of the presumption of constitutionality. The regulations were enforceable against both public and private institutions and did not discriminate unconstitutionally against private day care services. Although the association's schools complied with previous regulations, the new regulations did not become unconstitutional because they imposed new financial burdens upon association members.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting under the New York City Charter (&sect; 558), the New York City Board of Health has revised and repealed much of the old Sanitary Code of the City of New York and has enacted a new and modernized New York City Health Code.  Article 47 of said Health Code, entitled &quot;Day Care Services&quot;, is authorized by the police power of the State through its municipality, the city, and is presumed to be constitutional unless shown to have no reasonable relation to the public health or welfare.  It is not unconstitutional merely because it imposes new financial burdens on proprietors of existing nursery schools and kindergartens. Specifically, section 47.05 (subd. [a], par. [5]) requiring an applicant for a permit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to conduct a day care service to furnish &quot;Evidence of a reasonably secure financial position to permit compliance with the provisions of this Code&quot;, and section 47.07 (subd.

[a], [b], [d]) setting forth the qualifications required for the teachers and staff and the conditions of supervision, are unambiguous, valid and constitutional.  They do not abrogate or encroach upon the regulations of the New York City Board of Education and of the State Department of Education, or upon the State Sanitary Code or the Rules of the State Board of Social Welfare (cf. Social Welfare Law, &sect; 390).  The State has not completely pre-empted the field.  The above-cited regulations of the New York City Health Code are in accord with modern public health practices, and this action for a judgment declaring them unconstitutional is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated actions, plaintiff laundromat owners sought a declaratory judgment that New York City, N.Y., Local Law No. 14 (1961) was invalid and unconstitutional, and injunctive relief. On interlocutory appeal, a temporary injunction that enjoined the enforcement of the Sunday closing provision, was modified so as to strike out a decretal paragraph, which amounted to a final determination. As modified the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Local Law No. 14 amended New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect;&sect; B32-167.0, B32-173.0 so as to require licenses for automatic and coin-operated laundry operations and regulate business hours. The owners' actions for declaratory judgment were consolidated. The court declared that the local law was valid as to weekdays and as requiring laundry operations to remain closed from midnight to 6:00 a.m. on Sundays. However, the law was invalid as to requiring closing or an attendant on Sundays from 6:00 a.m. to midnight. The court enjoined the enforcement of the invalid portions of the law. The basic issue was the validity of the local law under the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions, the home rule provisions of the state constitution, and the city home rule law. The court found that the state had pre-empted the field of Sunday legislation. The court concluded that the regulation of the evening hours was a proper municipal function taking reasonable steps toward the control and reduction of crime, during the midnight to 6:00 a.m. hours. There was no reason why the daytime Sunday hours, which were not otherwise prohibited by state law, should have been restricted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a declaratory judgment that in part invalidated the local law that regulated weekday and Sunday business hours of automatic and coin-operated laundry operations.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Administrative Code of the City of New York (&sect; B32-173.0, subds.  f, g, as amd. by Local Laws, 1961, No. 14 of City of New York) provides in part: &quot;f. All laundry operations, whether automatic or coin operated, whether attended or unattended, shall close all day Sunday and between the hours of 12:00 midnight to 6:00 A.M. on all other days.  g. All coin operated laundries shall be required to have on the premises an attendant from 6:00 p.m. until closing.&quot; This regulation is reasonable, constitutional and valid (N. Y. Const., art.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The severability of the invalid portions of a law, and the question of which of the valid portions shall be retained, turn not so much on the sentence structure and paragraph arrangement, as on the presumed or indicated legislative intent in case of such partial invalidity. </SPAN></P>

The court found that defendants sought a jury trial without regard to the nature or type of misdemeanor charged, based on the possibility that there might not be a unanimous determination. The court found that if it granted defendants' request, all defendants charged with misdemeanors could make a like application on such a ground.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff village brought an action against defendants, an owner of a mobile home park and a lessee, to enjoin defendants' continued maintenance of the mobile home park without application for and issuance of a permit as required by an ordinance. The village requested a temporary injunction, and defendant filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village adopted an ordinance which provided that automobile trailers could only be maintained within the village if a permit was obtained by a majority vote from a board of trustees. The village brought an action against defendants for the failure to apply for the permits. The village filed a motion for a temporary injunction, and defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment claiming that the ordinance was unconstitutional. Defendants agreed that they would not permit any additional mobile homes upon their premises until the matter was resolved. The court granted summary judgment for the village pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3212(b). The court held that under N.Y. Village Law &sect; 89(59) the village was permitted to enact the ordinance for the promotion of the public welfare. The regulation of trailer camps bore a substantial relation to the public welfare and was a valid exercise of the police power. The regulation of trailer camps, relating to the public welfare, was an exercise of a legislative function and no general standards had to be formulated. The court ruled that mobile home parks were included in the ordinance even though only automobile trailers was mentioned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Even before villages were expressly empowered to regulate &quot;house trailer camps&quot;, they had such power under their general &quot;welfare&quot; power (Village Law, &sect; 89, subds. 59, 69).  An ordinance prohibiting &quot;automobile trailers&quot; unless a special permit were applied for and issued upon a majority vote of the village's board of trustees and on such conditions as might be imposed by the board for the welfare of the village, constitutionally and validly applies to a so-called &quot;mobile homes&quot; development.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed a motion to vacate search warrants issued and to suppress the evidence obtained by the State as a result of the execution of the search warrants. Defendants claimed that the affidavits on which the search warrants were based were legally insufficient and contained no factual information sufficient to indicate probable cause for the issuance of the search warrants. Defendants also argued that the affidavits did not indicate any probable cause supported by facts and circumstances therein to indicate that any law was being violated. The court rejected defendants' arguments. The court noted that probable cause existed when there was reasonable ground of suspicion supported by facts and circumstances strong enough to warrant a cautious man in the belief that the law was being violated on the premises to be searched. Here, the court determined that the decision to issue the search warrants was neither arbitrary nor patently erroneous. The court also found that the fact that the facts underlying the search warrants were sworn to before a different judge than the one that signed the search warrants was not unduly prejudicial and sufficiently complied with the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner argued that the municipality's zoning of the property was unconstitutional. The municipality argued that the property owner brought the property with knowledge of its zoning and with the intention of making a profit and therefore was precluded from testing the validity of the municipality's ordinance. The court rejected the municipality's argument, finding that the payment of a premium purchase price for property did not disqualify the property owner from arguing that the property's zoning was unconstitutional in relation to the fair market value of the property. The municipality also argued that testimony as to the economic loss suffered if the property zoning were not changed. The court accepted this argument, finding that testimony as to the value of the property considering a change in zoning was inadmissible. Ultimately, the court found that the municipality's ordinance went too far in the name of aesthetics and caused hardship to the property owner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A village zoning ordinance restricts plaintiff's property to use for one-family dwellings and accessory use as professional office, and to use for schools and public buildings.  The ordinance has remained thus unchanged as to plaintiff's property for over 30 years, even though this property is on a principal thoroughfare on which all other properties for two and one-half miles are now zoned for commercial or apartment house uses, and even though the last time a one-family residence was built in this area was 39 years ago.  There is no demand for plaintiff's property for school or public building use; and the court is satisfied that, even considering possible professional accessory use, the influence of the surrounding entirely commercial and apartment house area would make impossible the sale of residences along this thoroughfare at a price compatible with the applicable tax rates, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  even if this property were to be subdivided. A village's zoning of land on a principal thoroughfare cannot ignore the zoning outside the village's borders. This zoning precludes any use for which plaintiff's property is reasonably adapted. As to plaintiff's property, the ordinance is adjudged to be arbitrary, unreasonable, unconstitutional and void.  Of course, it remains for the Village Board to determine what is &quot;the most appropriate use of land&quot; (Village Law, &sect; 177).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rendered its decision on a complaint filed by a landowner, which sought the invalidation of an ordinance by which defendant village board rezoned property from business to residential uses. The landowner claimed that the ordinance was invalid because it was not in accordance with a master plan, was discriminatory, and was confiscatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner owned two parcels of land within the village. One of the parcels was adjacent to property that was used for retail and other business purposes. The second parcel was adjacent to a nursery school and a gas station. The parcels were zoned for business use when the landowner acquired them, but the village board adopted an ordinance to rezone the land for residential use. The court held that the ordinance was in accordance with a comprehensive plan because it conformed to the village's master plan and because it was consistent and based upon the need to control traffic congestion. The court determined that the reduction of the property values after it was rezoned was not conclusive on the issue of whether the ordinance was confiscatory. Because the value of the first parcel was reduced, the parcel was rendered useless by the rezoning, and there were existing business uses in the area that was rezoned, the court determined that the ordinance was unconstitutional as to that parcel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two business zones in a village were reclassified as a residential zone, except for a small portion.  The zoning ordinance amendment was &quot;made in accordance with a comprehensive plan&quot; and &quot;designed to lessen congestion in the streets&quot; and &quot;to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation&quot; (Village Law, &sect; 177).  Plaintiff property owner's investment in one parcel thus reclassified was $ 160,000, and its value if zoned for business was $ 425,000 while its value if zoned as residential is only $ 165,000; and his investment in another parcel thus&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reclassified was $ 65,000, and its value if zoned for business was $ 250,000 while its value if zoned as residential is only $ 46,000; but these figures do not constitute confiscation.  However, as to the latter, which is a vacant parcel on the other side of the same main thoroughfare, (1) plaintiff has sustained the burden of proving that its shape and terrain and surroundings are such that the residential reclassification would preclude any use of this parcel to which it is reasonably adaptable, and (2) plaintiff has proved that this amendment discriminates against his parcel without reasonable basis and therefore denies him the equal protection of the law, by its failure to include in this residential reclassification an area which is adjacent to his and which is circumstanced the same as his except that it contains some retail stores and businesses which would still remain in the business zone and which would therefore have the right to change to any other use permissible in a business zone; accordingly, the rezoning amendment is declared unconstitutional and void as to this parcel of plaintiff's.  </SPAN></P>

They are not obscene within the meaning of section 1141 of the Penal Law, as that section must be constitutionally construed in light of the free press guarantee of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff litigant sought review of an order entered in the Police Justice Court of the Village of Port Chester (New York) that granted defendant foreign corporation's motion to vacate service of a summons and to dismiss the action on the ground that the court did not have jurisdiction over the foreign corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The litigant filed an action to recover a sum of money from the foreign corporation. The lower court dismissed the action on the basis that it had no jurisdiction over the foreign corporation. On appeal, the litigant argued that jurisdiction existed over the foreign corporation because it was an insurance corporation doing business within the state on whom service of process could be effected by service on a local or general agent residing in the county pursuant to N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 54. The foreign corporation argued that service on it was void as it contravened N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 18 because as a foreign corporation, it was not amenable to jurisdiction in the county court on which the lower court's jurisdiction was predicated. The court agreed with the foreign corporation. The court noted that as an inferior local court, the lower court's jurisdiction was limited by the jurisdiction conferred by the legislature on the county courts. In this case, as the legislature had not conferred jurisdiction over foreign corporations in the county courts, the lower court here had no jurisdiction over the foreign corporation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice's Courts cannot have &quot;greater jurisdiction * * * than is conferred upon county courts&quot; (N. Y. Const., former art. VI, &sect; 18).  The County Courts have not been given jurisdiction of foreign corporations, even when the corporation does business in this State and has its principal place of business in that county (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 67, subd. 3; &sect; 68).  Therefore, the Justice Court Act (&sect;&sect; 10, 51, 54) and the Port Chester Police Justice Court Act (L. 1949, ch. 851, &sect; 13) cannot constitutionally confer such jurisdiction on such inferior courts.  Accordingly, in this action in the Police Justice Court of the Village of Port Chester, Westchester County, for $ 41.25, against a New Jersey insurance corporation which is authorized to do business in New York State and which has an office in the City of White Plains, Westchester County, the service of summons in White Plains on the manager of said office was vacated.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent juvenile was before the court in a fact-finding hearing pursuant to a petition by petitioner correction officer to determine delinquency pursuant to N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 716(a), which was a hearing to determine whether the juvenile did the act or acts alleged in the petition which, if done by an adult, would have constituted a crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a petition to determine delinquency, a juvenile was charged with unlawfully possessing barbiturates and Doriden. He confessed to the correction officer that they were drugs and consented to being searched. In the finding of fact hearing to determine delinquency, the court held that: (1) the pills in the juvenile's possession were &quot;drugs or devices&quot; whose possession, sale, and/or distribution by the juvenile were unlawful; and (2) no additional corroboration of the juvenile's extrajudicial confession was required because additional corroboration was found in the form of the officer himself who had observed the juvenile's intoxicated appearance while committing the elements of the crime of sale and distribution, and because the pills themselves were entered into evidence. The court also denied the motion to suppress evidence found on the juvenile by the officer because the search and seizure were not &quot;unreasonable&quot; because a &quot;peace officer&quot;, pursuant to N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 154-a (1963), could make a warrantless arrest if a non-felony crime was being committed or attempted in his presence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the correction officer had proven his prima facie case that the juvenile had unlawfully possessed and distributed drugs. The court ruled that the juvenile had the burden at the next hearing to go forward with defense evidence and if not successful, the finding would stand with finality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A correction officer observed respondent, a 15-year-old boy, take a dollar placed on a mail box by a youth, and pass to the youth something in his hand.  After respondent walked away unsteadily the officer approached and spoke to respondent.  The officer identified himself and asked that respondent permit him to frisk respondent.  Respondent agreed and later emptied his pockets of two unlabeled bottles containing pills&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and nine one-dollar bills.  Respondent confessed that the white pills were &quot;Doriden&quot; and the green pills were barbiturates, which he sold for stated prices.  Respondent confessed that he had been taking them and that his &quot;doped&quot; condition resulted from taking some.  The pills in evidence were drugs and the sale of some of them to the youth was an unlawful sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. On this petition to determine whether respondent was delinquent, competent evidence was required by section 744 of the Family Court Act and such section also provided that an uncorroborated confession made out of court was insufficient.  In this case, respondent's confession was corroborated by evidence of the drugged physical appearance and shuffling gait of respondent, by the pills, by the nine one-dollar bills, by respondent's identification of the pills as &quot;Doriden&quot; and &quot;barbiturates&quot; which respondent knew were drugs because of the effects on his own body.  Chemical analysis of the pills was therefore unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Respondent's possession and sale of barbiturates and &quot;Doriden&quot;, a drug, would have violated section 1740, and section 1747-b (possession of barbiturate without a proper label) of the Penal Law, a misdemeanor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  if committed by an older person and therefore supported the delinquency petition and a finding of delinquency. Respondent, however, was granted an opportunity to go forward with defense evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Amendment of the petition was granted to eliminate a reference to &quot;Doriden&quot; as a barbiturate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The arresting officer frisked respondent with respondent's consent and respondent voluntarily emptied his pockets of the vials of pills and voluntarily confessed. When the vials and confession were disclosed, a misdemeanor of unlawfully possessing unlabeled narcotics was disclosed to the arresting officer and the search and seizure were reasonable and the officer had power to arrest even without a warrant.  Respondent's motion to suppress evidence was denied.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner's husband retired in 1946 and was paid a pension until he died in 1962.  Under Local Law No. 1 of 1940 of said city effective at his retirement, only the husband was entitled to a pension. By Local Law No. 1 of 1952 these local laws were amended so as to grant to a widow of a retired policeman after his death the sum&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of $ 900 per year.  In 1952 section 1 of article VIII of the State Constitution provided that no municipality give money to any individual.  Section 8 of article VII of the Constitution, as amended effective January 1, 1952, provided that the Legislature might increase the amount of a pension. Chapter 319 of the Laws of 1952 empowered any municipality to adopt and amend a local law providing for supplemental pension payments to retired employees.  Section 1 of article VIII of the Constitution, as amended effective January 1, 1960, granted power to a municipality to increase the pension benefits to retired members of a police department or to widows of retired members of a police department. The constitutional provisions in effect when Local Law No. 1 of 1952 was adopted prohibited an increase in pension benefits to petitioner's husband in the form of a pension for his widow. Moreover, Local Law No. 1 of 1952 was prospective in application and not retrospective to a person who had retired in 1946.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The amendment to section 1 of article VIII of the Constitution, effective January 1, 1960, did not validate the Local Law of 1952.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fireman alleged that he was severely injured while fighting a fire in the citizen's building. He further alleged that 90 days prior to the fire the citizen had received a notice from the city building department that the building was in a dilapidated condition so as to be dangerous to the life and safety of others. The notice directed the citizen to demolish the building.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the trial court (New York), defendants filed motions to suppress the use of certain evidence seized from their stores in their arrests for pandering obscene material.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police were shown a list of book titles and were directed to 20 bookstores in Times Square. The officers visited the shops assigned to them, buying certain books and photographs. The police examined their purchases and arrested defendants. The police then searched the premises and seized other materials. Defendants were charged with violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1141. Defendants filed motions to suppress the evidence. The court denied the motions with respect to all of the purchased exhibits, but granted the motion as to all of the other exhibits. The court held that there were no violations of defendants' rights under U.S. Const. amends. I or IV. The court found that the voluntary sale of alleged obscene material to a person, who turned out to be a police officer, for which sale the seller was arrested and prosecuted, did not constitute suppression of freedom of speech or thought, any more than it constituted denial of due process. The court held that the act of offering for sale, or sale, of obscene material to a police officer, constituted the commission of a misdemeanor in his presence, for which an arrest may have been made without a warrant under N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shipping companies filed motions to dismiss a complaint brought by the state, which alleged that they violated several provisions of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate actions which arose from alleged violations of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, the state alleged that defendants violated the law by engaging in interstate and international alcohol shipping activities, and advertising and solicitation of liquor sales and purchases. Plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment against the chairman and the commissioner, who determined that plaintiffs could not deliver alcohol to state residents that was purchased by those residents while they were outside of the United States. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. Plaintiffs filed motions for judgment on the pleadings or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The actions were consolidated. The court granted the motions because the activities of defendants and plaintiffs did not violate any of the provisions of the law. The court held that the purpose of the law was to regulate the manufacture, sale, and distribution of alcoholic beverages within the state, and not to regulate activities outside of the state. Further, the court held that plaintiffs' activities were specifically allowed by N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 116(c).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 100 (subd. 1) of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law prohibited the sale of liquor within the State by any person unless licensed. Section 102 prohibited the advertising of solicitations for an order for alcoholic beverages except by licensed persons, prohibited the shipment of alcoholic beverages into the State except to licensed consignees and prohibited carriers from bringing into the State alcoholic beverages unless consigned to licensees.  Defendants in the first action, unlicensed persons, sent advertisements into the State whereby travelers outside the United States could bring into the State &quot;duty free&quot; liquor and plaintiffs in the second action were carriers licensed to transport liquor within the State who delivered to New York residents alcoholic beverages which they purchased&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  outside the State and shipped such alcoholic beverages to themselves as consignees. The activities of defendants in the first action and plaintiffs in the second action did not violate the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law. The legislative purpose of the statute was to regulate the manufacture, sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages within the State.  Here, the parties to the contract of sale demonstrated their intention that title pass outside the State, where the order was placed and accepted, the payment was received, and the liquor purchased was appropriated to the contract.  The prohibition against advertising and soliciting orders applied only with respect to alcoholic beverages to be sold within the State.  Here, not only were the sales consummated outside the State, but the orders were placed outside the State as well.  By failing to include in the sections a prohibition against sales made outside the State by a purchaser outside the State, the Legislature indicated its intent that the sections did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sanitarium filed a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 action against respondent, Commissioner of Hospitals of the City of New York (commissioner), seeking reversal of the commissioner's decision to refuse to renew the sanitarium's annual license to conduct a private proprietary hospital, and to compel the commissioner to issue such a license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sanitarium alleged that it was in compliance with &sect; 35(b) of the Social Welfare Law and that the sole reason for the commissioner's refusal to renew its license was the failure of the sanitarium to amend its leases. There was a lease between the sanitarium and the landlord and a sublease of space from the sanitarium to two radiologists, who paid the sanitarium 21.2 percent of their gross receipts. The sanitarium argued that the refusal was arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law and unconstitutional. The court granted the sanitarium's petition and ordered the commissioner to issue an annual license for the operation of the sanitarium. The court found that the sanitarium did not practice medicine. It merely rented space to the radiologists who provided, and billed for, their medical care. The sanitarium only charged for board, lodging, non-medical care, and nursing. Such being the case, there was no basis for holding the leases invalid because neither the landlord nor the sanitarium were unlawfully participating in the practice of medicine. Additionally, N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6514(2) allowed the radiologists to pay a rental amount not to exceed 33.3 percent for use of facilities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the sanitarium's petition, annulled the commissioner's determination, and directed the commissioner to issue the sanitarium an annual license.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The denial of the renewal of petitioner's annual license to operate a private proprietary hospital by the Commissioner of Hospitals of the City of New York, on the ground that the hospital's lease of the premises and the sublease of space in the hospital for the operation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the radiology department were based on percentages of gross receipts, was annulled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 35-b of the Social Welfare Law, added in 1956, provided that only duly licensed physicians might operate hospitals for profit, except licensed hospitals in operation on the date the section took effect.  Since petitioner was operating its hospital before the section took effect, it was entitled to continue to be licensed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The hospital, by supplying facilities to patients of doctors and surgeons who alone rendered medical and surgical care, was not practicing medicine. The lease was therefore not invalid on the ground asserted by respondent Commissioner that the hospital was unlawfully participating in the practice of medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The landlord did not operate the hospital.  The lease between the sanitarium and landlord was executed at arm's length.  The percentage rental provisions did not place landlord in any different position so far as operation of the hospital was concerned than would fixed rental provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Subdivision 2 of section 6514 of the Education Law provided for the punishment of a practitioner of medicine for offenses stated therein.

Since the operators of the radiology department of the hospital were obligated to pay 21.2% of their gross receipts, their sublease with the operator was neither unlawful nor unethical. The inclusion of the rent from the operation of the radiology department in landlord's percentage was proper and, in any event, neither the operator nor the landlord was engaged in the practice of medicine. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency adopted New York City, N.Y., Health Code &sect; 181.15, which made it unlawful for any person to tattoo a human being, with the exception that tattooing could be performed for medical purposes. Thereafter, the operators filed an action against the agency and its commissioner, asserting that the law was unconstitutional. The court found that the law was designed to insure sanitary and sterile procedures for tattooing establishments. There was also a relationship between serum hepatitis and tattooing under unsafe conditions. The court found that tattooing could be performed in a manner that presented no health problems with regard to serum hepatitis. Further, there was evidence that tattooing machines and equipment could be entirely sterilized. The court found that the agency abandoned its previously adopted regulation of tattooing, in favor of prohibition, without ever having actually enforced the regulation by fine or criminal penalty. The court concluded that the law was violative of due process. Therefore, the court held that the law was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion for an order to suppress evidence premised on the ground that it was obtained by an illegal search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question before the court on defendant's motion to suppress evidence was whether the court had the power to pass upon the legal and factual validity of a confession by a defendant, allegedly coerced, pursuant to which confession he made disclosure of the existence of certain contraband, a revolver, disclosed its hiding place, and turned it over to the police. The court held that the New York suppression procedure of N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 813-c, which operated in advance of trial to exclude the physical and tangible results of property obtained by the police as a result of an unlawful search and seizure, was broad enough to encompass, within its scope, the suppression of such tangible evidence when it was obtained by the police as a result of a confession extracted from a defendant in violation of his constitutional rights. The court's basic consideration for so holding was the expedition of the business of the courts by avoidance, whenever possible, of the trial, error, appeal, and retrial formula. The court granted the motion to suppress the evidence because the production of the revolver under coercive circumstances was at least factually of an involuntary nature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence produced following and as a direct result of a confession coercively obtained by the police.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowner filed an action with the court, claiming that the refusal of respondent building inspector to issue a building permit pursuant to Greenburg, N.Y., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 8(E) was unconstitutional and invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner ran a country club that was partially destroyed by fire. He filed with the inspector an application for a permit to repair the facilities that were destroyed. The inspector denied the application stating that the country club was deemed to be a nonconforming use and could not be rebuilt pursuant to the zoning ordinance. Prior to the adoption of the ordinance the landowner had a vested nonconforming use. The landowner then filed an action to have the ordinance declared unconstitutional and invalid. On review, the court ruled in favor of the landowner. The court held that the ordinance was unreasonable and unconstitutional in that it permitted the rebuilding of nonconforming structures only if their damage or destruction did not exceed 50 percent. The court stated that the volume of the structure that was destroyed could not be substituted for the value of the structure or the deprivation that would result if the reconstruction was not permitted. The court noted that the landowner properly filed his action attacking the validity of the ordinance not with the zoning board but with the court because to do the former would have assumed the validity of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner owned land in a residence district operated as a recreation center as a nonconforming use. A portion of a building housing the restaurant and bar was destroyed by fire, and when petitioner applied for a building permit it was denied because it was a nonconforming use. In this proceeding to compel the issuance of a building permit, the constitutionality of the ordinance was properly challenged.  Petitioner was not required to first apply to the Zoning Board of Appeals for a variance. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By doing so, petitioner would concede that the ordinance was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The ordinance which, as a matter of right, permitted petitioner to restore a nonconforming building only if the damage did not exceed 50% of the volume of the building above the foundation, was unreasonable, confiscatory and unconstitutional.  Measuring damage on the basis of volume rather than value afforded the property owner inadequate protection.  The important consideration was not what was destroyed, but that what was left might be valueless if the reconstruction were not permitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Even though petitioner did not show in his application what percentage of the volume of the building was destroyed and even though it could show that 50% of the volume was not destroyed, petitioner still had the right to determine the constitutionality of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The provision that the premises, if rebuilt or restored, be in substantially the same location provided it were not enlarged or extended was a reasonable requirement.</SPAN></P>

All parties filed motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The waterworks corporation had a franchise contract to supply water to the area where the limited-profit housing corporation was building a project. The waterworks corporation anticipated the additional need for water and purchased land in order to construct a water storage tank. Subsequently, the Board of Estimate of the City of New York adopted a resolution approving plans and specifications for hauling and laying water mains in various streets in the waterworks corporation's franchise area. Certain monies were to be paid by the limited-profit housing corporation over a five year period. The waterworks corporation contended that the resolution adopted paralleled its existing water mains with consequent loss of revenue to the waterworks corporation. Furthermore, the $ 250,000 owed by the limited-profit housing corporation was a loan and illegal under N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 because the City could not loan money. Granting defendants' motions, the court held that the waterworks corporation's franchise was not exclusive and was not being revoked. The court held that the money owed by the limited-profit housing corporation was a contribution and not a loan.</SPAN></P>

The court found that by enacting 1963 N. Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord filed dispossession proceedings against defendant tenants for failure to pay rent. The tenants argued that N.Y. Soc.

Welfare Law &sect; 143b was unconstitutional in that it permitted a taking of property. The court recognized that the government could not take one's property without due process, but held that due process did not mean the complete absence of restraint on property. The court stated that an owner held his property under the implied liability that his use could be regulated and that his use of it could not be injurious to the community. The court found that the government's police power extended to protection of housing and held that &sect; 143b was constitutional and that there was no &quot;taking of property&quot; involved in its operation, because the landlord had only to keep his property in good condition to prevent a tenant from withholding the rent pursuant to the law's provisions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State moved for an order dismissing claimant hotel's claim for damages due to a permanent negative easement over its lands by the Superintendent of Public Works on the grounds that the court does not have jurisdiction of the subject of the action and that the claim does not set forth facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hotel filed a claim alleging that the State through the superintendent instituted appropriation proceedings against its predecessors in title, taking a permanent negative easement over the lands of the hotel, with the right of entry to remove and demolish any signs which might be placed thereon in violation of such easement. The hotel sought damages from the allegedly unlawful act. The court held that it had no authority to allow for recovery for the portion of the claim seeking compensation for legal services. The court found that that the filing of a taking map created a cloud upon title, even though the filing occurred because of the superintendent's misinterpretation of the extent of the powers granted to him. However, although the claim set forth facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, the filing of the hotel's notice of intention and of the hotel's instant claim were belated. Regardless of the reason for filing the claim beyond the statutory two-year period, because the claim was belatedly filed, the court lacked jurisdiction of the subject of the action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State filed a map on May 16, 1959 taking a permanent negative easement over the lands of claimant's predecessors with the right of entry to remove and demolish any signs placed thereon in violation of the easement.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Superintendent of Highways filed a map under an erroneous interpretation of the extent of the authority conferred by section 30 of the Highway Law. A cloud on title was thereby created.  The Superintendent, while acting in the scope of his duties, is exonerated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from civil liability by his erroneous interpretation of the statute, but the State is not exonerated for an unauthorized appropriation proceeding.

It was dismissed on September 18, 1961 without prejudice to filing claims for damages sustained by claimants. A notice of intention to file a claim was filed on October 3, 1961 and the claim filed on November 30, 1961.  Whatever reason may exist or be apparent for the filing beyond the statutory two-year period, it was not timely filed more than two years after the accrual of the claim.  The claim is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

XIV and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. Plaintiffs also sought a permanent injunction. The parties filed cross-motions. The court held that that based on prior adjudications, the declarations sought by plaintiffs were without merit. The legislature had a right to exercise its police powers in what it deemed was an emergency situation. That was true even if plaintiffs' properties had not been subject to regulation with regard to rent in the past. The fact that plaintiffs could not in the future run their operations free from control was not the denial of due process. The court granted defendant's application for declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher maintained that &sect; 2569-a was unconstitutional and sought an order requiring the Board and the officials to discontinue its licensing examinations, to establish eligible lists, and to make appointments to regular teaching positions. Section 2569-a allowed the board of examiners in city school districts having a population of 1,000,000 or more to conduct examinations for licenses as regular teachers that were limited to experienced substitute teachers. N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 6 provided that all appointments and promotions in the civil service had to be made according to merit and fitness, which was to be ascertained, so far as practicable, by competitive examinations. The court found that N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 6 did not prohibit the legislature from enacting a law that opened a competitive examination to only experienced substitute teachers. In that regard, it noted that N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 50 gave municipal commissions and the state civil service department the authority to set minimum qualifications for competitive examinations. Moreover, the tests conducted pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2569-a were competitive in that they utilized an objective standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to dismiss three informations, which charged him with violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 962-a. That statute provided that any employer (or its president, secretary, or treasurer) who was party to an agreement to pay benefits, or wage supplements as defined in N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 222, and who failed to pay such benefits or furnish such supplements within 30 days after such payments were required to be made was guilty of a misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a former president of a corporation that was a party to two agreements, requiring it to pay benefits and wage supplements. One information charged that the corporation failed to pay an amount due to an annuity fund of the electrical industry's joint industrial board. Another information charged that the corporation failed to pay an employee an amount due him in vacation pay. The third information charged that the corporation failed to pay an amount due to the electrical manufacturing industry's employees' retirement fund. The court rejected defendant's attack on the constitutional validity of the statute, finding it sufficiently definite to meet due process requirements. It also found no violation of N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect;16 because there was no incorporation of N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 220 in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 962-a. The court denied the motion to dismiss the informations relating to the amounts due the annuity fund and the retirement fund because it was conceded that such amounts were due and owing for more than 30 days. It dismissed the indictment relating to vacation pay because the record demonstrated that the employee had been paid for his vacation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the two indictments relating to payments the corporation owed to the annuity fund and retirement fund and found defendant guilty on both informations.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 962-a of the Penal Law provided that any employer who was a party to an agreement to pay or provide benefits, or wage supplements as defined in section 220 of the Labor Law, and who failed to pay the amounts necessary to provide such benefits within 30 days after they were required&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be made, was guilty of a misdemeanor. The supplements defined in section 220 of the Labor Law were the same wage supplements referred to in section 962-a of the Penal Law. Read together, the statutes gave reasonable notice of what they required be done and avoided.  The statute did not conflict with the requirements of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 962-a was not unconstitutional as incorporating therein section 220 of the Labor Law, in whole or in part.  There was merely the borrowing of a definition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant was president of a company which entered into an agreement with a labor union providing, among other things, for the payment of moneys into an Annuity Fund and a Retirement Fund and for vacation pay for employee members of the union.  It was alleged that all payments referred to were unpaid for more than 30 days.  Section 962-a further provided that, where the employer was a corporation, the president, secretary, treasurer or officers exercising corresponding functions was each guilty of a misdemeanor. With respect to moneys due an Annuity Fund, the corporation, while defendant was president, entered into an agreement with the union to amortize its delinquency at the rate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of $ 700 per month, which was paid while defendant was president.  The agreement had no effect on the nature or amount of the underlying obligation. At the time the agreement to amortize was made, the whole amount was due.  Defendant's claim that he was not guilty of violating section 962-a because the amounts for amortizing were paid while he was president was therefore rejected.  He was found guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. He was also guilty with respect to the sums due the Retirement Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. With respect to the charge that defendant failed to provide vacation pay for a named employee, defendant was not guilty.  The employee took a vacation and was paid therefor.  No explanation was offered as to what the sum of $ 84 claimed represented.  </SPAN></P>

The court distinguished between the property of the partnerships, the partner's interest in specific partnership property, and the partner's interest in the partnership.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 812 provided that the family court had exclusive jurisdiction over any proceeding concerning acts that would constitute an assault between spouses. N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 813 provided for the transfer to family court of any criminal complaint charging an assault between spouses. The husband argued that these statutes required the State to transfer his criminal assault case to family court. The court disagreed. The stated legislative intention of these statutes was to substitute a civil proceeding for criminal cases not because the State had been affronted, but because the complainant needed help. This objective would not be consistent with the substitution of a civil proceeding for a criminal trial in cases where the crime was infamous and would have found its way into the criminal court because of the very nature of the offense. Moreover, the term &quot;exclusive jurisdiction&quot; as applied to inferior courts had been held not to limit the jurisdiction of courts of general jurisdiction and the identical term, as used in the Family Court Act, should be considered merely as defining jurisdiction between that court and other inferior courts.</SPAN></P>

The court held that an affidavit established the requisite probable cause for the issuance of the warrant. The court ruled that N.Y. Code Crim.

The court granted summary judgment in favor of the village. The court held that whether or not the statute was illegal, the developer could not recover its payment. The court held that money paid under an unconstitutional or invalid statute or ordinance, without circumstances of compulsion, and paid under a mistake of law could not be recovered.The court held that the developer paid the money without duress and without protest.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to the Village Law ( &sect; 179-1), a village's code required developers of proposed subdivisions to set aside 10% of the acreage for park and playground purposes.  A developer's map of section 1 of his lots, with 10% of the area marked for park purposes, was thus approved by the village's planning commission, with the understanding that a further decision would be made if and when he filed a plat of section 2 of his lots.  Subsequently he filed his map section 2; and the village and its planning commission waived their requirement that 10% of the acreage be reserved for park purposes, upon condition that he deposit with the village $ 250 a lot.  Thereupon he paid, for such waiver of his 24 lots, $ 6,000.  He has&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  since sold 19 lots.

The city civil service commission was abolished. Thereafter a new city council appointed a new city civil service commission and purported to retransfer the civil service administration to it. The state civil service commission refused to accept the new city civil service commission's rules on the ground that there was no authority for the re-establishment of a municipal civil service commission. The city commission filed suit to compel respondents to accept the rules and terminate the county's administration of the city's civil service system. The court dismissed the suit, holding that &sect; 1008 was constitutional. The court held that the action of the city in electing to have its civil service administered by the county civil service commission was both valid and properly taken. The court held that &sect; 1008 did not violate N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 15, N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 11, or N.Y. City Home Rule Law &sect; 11(1)(b).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- civil service system -- section 1008 of Optional County Government Law authorized city council in city wholly within county to elect to transfer administration of city civil service system to County Civil Service Commission; section did not relate to property, affairs or government of city, was general law, and was constitutional -- city message of necessity adopted by City of Rochester for section was proper; petitioners could not attack adequacy of city message -- City of Rochester's council, in December, 1961, transferred administration of civil service to county commission; new council, in January, 1962 purported to reinstate City Civil Service Commission; State commission properly ruled that city lacked authority to re-establish city commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 1008 of the Optional County Government Law was enacted by chapter 565 of the Laws of 1961 and provided that the council in a city wholly within a county might change the existing civil service administration and elect that the Civil Service Law in the city be administered by the County Civil Service Commission. Section 11 of article IX of the Constitution provided that the Legislature act &quot;in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  relation to the property, affairs or government of any city only by general laws which shall in terms and in effect apply alike to all cities&quot; but was not restricted to enact laws &quot;relating to matters other than the property, affairs or government of cities&quot;.  An act dealing with the civil service system was a matter of general, State-wide concern rather than a matter of purely local concern. Accordingly, section 1008 of the Optional County Government Law did not relate to the &quot;property, affairs or government of any city&quot;, and the Legislature was free to enact the section without a city message. Moreover, section 1008 was not a law local in effect but applied to any county, even assuming that Monroe County was presently the only county within the scope of the section.  The section was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Moreover the city message of necessity adopted by the City of Rochester was proper.  Section 23 of the City Home Rule Law provided that the validity of an act passed pursuant to such request &quot;shall not be subject to review by the courts on the ground that the necessity alleged in the request did not exist or was not properly established by the facts recited.&quot; Petitioners therefore&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  could not attack the adequacy of the city message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Pursuant to section 1008, the outgoing City Council of the City of Rochester in December, 1961 elected to place its civil service system under the administration of the County Civil Service Commission. In January, 1962 the new City Council, by a local law and ordinance, appointed a new City Civil Service Commission and purported to revoke the action of the prior council.  The State Civil Service Commission properly declined to accept new rules adopted by the new City Civil Service Commission on the ground that there was no authority for the re-establishment of a municipal civil service commission. Section 11 (subd. 1, par. [b]) of the City Home Rule Law gave the local Legislature power to amend local laws dealing with compensation, number, terms of office of officers and employees and provided that such local laws may change any provision of an act of the Legislature theretofore enacted.  Such section did not give rise to the right to supersede section 1008.  Section 1008 did not deal with the matters covered by section 11.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city amended its building zone ordinance so as to upzone plaintiffs' properties from a light manufacturing district to a single family residence district. Plaintiffs brought a declaratory judgment action against the city and others, seeking a declaration that the amendment was unconstitutional as confiscatory as applied to their properties. The court declared the amendment unconstitutional as to the unimproved properties and dismissed the suit as to the improved properties. The court held that the value of the unimproved properties, which were surrounded by properties used for industrial properties, was completely destroyed because it was not suitable for use as residential property or for small businesses. The court held that the amendment was confiscatory as applied to those parcels. The court held that the landowners of the improved properties had not sustained their burden to prove that the buildings thereon could not have been reasonably and economically converted to such use for scientific or research laboratories.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant city amended its zoning ordinance so as to change the zone of a 19 1/2-acre oval tract formerly in a light manufacturing district to a one-half acre single-family district.  Several plaintiffs, owners of industrial establishments therein, acquired nonconforming uses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Two plaintiffs owned unimproved parcels in the center of the tract. One was larger than the other.  The larger parcel was surrounded by factories, as was the smaller parcel. Neither parcel was adapted to single-family dwelling use, to municipal building use, to school, college or university use or church use.  While they could be used for a greenhouse or nursery, or a scientific or research laboratory, they could not be so used economically or profitably.  The elimination of a normal market&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for the land so depressed its value as to eliminate profitability.  Under their present residential zoning, surrounded by industrial use, neither parcel was worth a fraction of its assessed valuation.  The ordinance was confiscatory as to such parcels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. With respect to the improved parcels, plaintiffs failed to meet the burden of showing that the ordinance presently invaded their property rights.  Plaintiffs failed to prove that the existing buildings could not be converted reasonably and economically to scientific or research laboratory use.  Moreover, the proof was insufficient to show that the value of the industrial buildings as nonconforming uses was so disproportionate to their value as permitted uses as to amount to confiscation. </SPAN></P>

The court held that an essential link in the chain of the state's evidence was missing. The officer's testimony did not exclude the possibility that there had been another occupant of the car.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about 2:30 a.m. a police officer in a patrol car found a lamppost knocked over, and, across the street, on the sidewalk, an automobile with its front smashed and its back against a building.  The car was smoldering and smoking, the motor was running, and there was no key in the ignition.  To an experienced policeman, all this suggested a car theft and joy ride.  On the front seat, there was a button on the driver's side and a fountain pen on the passenger's side.  No one was in sight.  But less than a block away he found the defendant seated on a step at the entrance to the subway.  A button was missing from defendant's left coat sleeve. The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  other buttons on the sleeve exactly matched the one found in the car.  The policeman took the defendant to the station house and there arrested him on charges of driving while intoxicated, driving without a license, and leaving the scene of an accident.  Defendant was then searched.  On his person were found the keys to said car, the car registration in a woman's name, and a Motor Vehicle Bureau learner's permit issued to the defendant.  He admitted that the fountain pen was his; but he denied any connection with the accident.  At the trial, the owner of the car testified that she had given the defendant permission to drive her car and to use the key and registration, and that he had paid her in full for the car when it was found to be a total loss; but she quickly withdrew and changed her testimony that the defendant had admitted driving the car.  Defendant offered no testimony.  The trial court, without a jury, found that the defendant was in the front seat of the car at the time of the accident, but that the circumstantial evidence did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was behind the wheel or that there was no other person in the car.  Defendant's motion, made&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at the close of the entire case, to dismiss the information, was granted.  </SPAN></P>

The court granted the New York corporation's motion for advance payment but denied the New Jersey corporation's motion without prejudice. The court held that if the failure of the port authority's general counsel to furnish the statutory certificate was arbitrary and capricious, and without substantial basis, the absence of the certificate could be disregarded.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The information sufficiently stated a violation of the subdivision.  It stated the time and place of the violation, the speed at which defendant was traveling and that such speed was greater than was reasonable and prudent. The information was clear without a statement of the conditions and without a statement that defendant failed to have regard for the actual and potential hazards then existing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendant was proven guilty of violating subdivision 1 of section 1180 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law beyond a reasonable doubt. Evidence as to conditions in the area was adequate as a matter of law to sustain the determination, and such determination was not against the weight of the evidence.  </SPAN></P>

The application for a receiver was made pursuant to N.Y. Mult. Dwell. Law &sect; 309, as amended by 1962 N.Y. Laws ch. 492, which allowed for appointment of a receiver over buildings that were in or in danger of becoming in a dilapidated condition. The owner of the building could not be located, and the only objection was filed by the mortgagee of the property. The mortgagee contended that the provision permitting appointment of a receiver was unconstitutional in that it improperly allowed the receiver to incur expenses to alter and improve the property, which in turn would effect the priority of the mortgage. However, the court noted that unlike previous &quot;receivership&quot; provisions, mortgagees were given notice and could apply to perform the work themselves along with other rights in protection of a lien. As such, the court granted the city's application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town brought an action against defendant village for a declaration that the village was required to compensate the town tax receiver at rates approved by the town and for recovery of a sum for services in collecting the village taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village adopted a resolution whereby the town tax receiver was to act as village tax receiver at a compensation not to exceed one percent of the village assessment roll. The village later adopted a resolution designating the town tax receiver as its tax receiver and providing that the compensation be paid to the town, but set the compensation at one-half of one percent. The town did not approve the reduction in compensation and the village clerk collected the taxes. The following year the town tax receiver did collect the village taxes. The village resolution provided for compensation of one-half of one percent; the town resolution provided for one percent. The town sought a declaratory judgment that the compensation had to be such amount up to one percent of the tax roll as was approved by the town. It also sought to recover compensation for collecting the taxes. The concluded that both the N.Y. Village Law and the county code could be harmonized. The village was permitted to vary the compensation from year to year, but that power was subject to the town's approval.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the town was entitled to judgment declaring that until the village's electors revoked their direction to designate the town tax receiver as village tax receiver, the village board was required to make such designation at a compensation up to one percent of the tax roll as was approved by the town. The court also found that the town was entitled to recover compensation for collecting the village's taxes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 121 of the Village Law (originally enacted in 1916 as &sect; 138-a) provided that village electors might, at a special village election, direct the Village Board of Trustees to adopt a resolution whereby the Town Tax Receiver&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would also act as Village Tax Receiver at a compensation not to exceed 1% of the village assessment roll. Section 544 of the Westchester County Administrative Code, enacted in 1948, provided that designation and compensation were subject to approval by the Town Board. The village electors of defendant village did direct the Board of Trustees to adopt such resolution, and such resolution was never rescinded. It was thus mandatory for the Village Board to designate the Town Tax Receiver to collect village taxes.  In 1958, the Village Board sought to reduce the compensation of the Town Tax Receiver to 1/2 of 1% of the assessment roll. The Town Board refused to consent to the reduced compensation.  In this action, plaintiff was granted judgment declaring that until defendant village's electors revoked their direction to the Village Board of Trustees to designate the Town Tax Receiver as Village Tax Receiver, the Village Board was required to make such designation at a compensation up to 1% of the assessment roll as was approved by the Town Board of plaintiff and, in addition, plaintiff was entitled to judgment against defendant village for $ 2,999 as compensation for collection of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant village's 1961 taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Village Board, under section 121 of the Village Law, was authorized to appoint the Town Tax Receiver as Village Tax Receiver, and the maximum compensation for the Receiver's services was stated.  The Westchester County Administrative Code empowered the town to approve the compensation.  While defendant village might reduce the compensation from year to year, that power was subject to Town Board approval, and defendant was therefore required to fix a compensation acceptable to the town.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant company moved for summary judgment to dismiss plaintiff competitor's unfair competition suit under an ordinance regulating signs at gasoline stations, which also claimed that the company did not have the right to sell gasoline under a brand name.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company sold gasoline under a different brand than the competitor, who sought to stifle price competition. The ordinance protected the public against misleading price advertising. New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; B36-103.0 regulated signs at gasoline stations. Section B36-104.0 prohibited the deception of purchasers about the price nature, quality, or identity of products. Granting the motion, the court said that the ordinance was enacted for the benefit of the public and disclosed no intention, express or implied, to create a new cause of action for unfair competition. Accordingly, the competitor's claim in that connection was insufficient as a matter of law and had to be dismissed. The ordinance was not designed to fix prices or protect competitors, but rather to protect the gasoline-purchasing public against fraud. A violation of the sign ordinance was not designed to give a right of action to the competitor, but to protect the public against misleading signs. The ordinance was not intended to create any civil right or remedy. Assuming that an intent could have been implied, it would have availed the competitor nothing. The competitor was not within the protected class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the company's motion for summary judgment against the competitor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Administrative Code of the City of New York prohibits gasoline stations from displaying signs larger than 12 inches by 12 inches &quot;referring directly or indirectly to the price or prices of gasoline&quot; (&sect; B36-103.0), and prohibits practices which &quot;deceive or tend to deceive the purchaser as to the price, nature, quality or identity [of the gasoline] or to sell or offer for sale from any pump, dispensing device, or container any gasoline * * * other than that * * * manufactured or distributed by the manufacturer or distributor * * * under the name, trade name, brand, symbol or mark affixed to or contained on such pump, dispensing device or container, or to substitute, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  mix or adulterate gasoline&quot; (&sect; B36-104.0), and imposes a fine of not more than $ 250 and/or imprisonment of not more than 60 days for a violation of either of the above sections (&sect; B36-105.0).  Defendant Save Way Northern Boulevard, Inc., displayed an oversize sign reading &quot;SAVE WAY&quot;, and was convicted of violating the above section B36-103.0, and the Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of that section and affirmed the conviction (10 N Y 2d 727). But this subsequent civil action against said defendant by an undersold competitor, for damages, is dismissed.  The statute does not, and cannot constitutionally be construed to, give to a competitor a civil cause of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant is one of 17 gasoline stations in 6 States which sell &quot;Save Way&quot; gasoline at about two cents below the nationally advertised brands of the major oil refiners.  Defendant's pumps and signs label its gasoline as &quot;Save Way&quot;.  It has not been proved that defendant buys its gasoline from any one of the major oil refiners; but even if defendant does, defendant may sell the gasoline under its own name &quot;Save Way&quot;, and it does not thereby violate the above quoted section B36-104.0 of the Administrative&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Code of the City of New York; and in any event, even if said section were to be construed to authorize a civil action by oil refiner against a retailer, it could not constitutionally be construed to authorize a civil action by a retailer against a retailer. </SPAN></P>

Defendant was the operator of the vessel, which was not competing in a regatta. Therefore, the major issue for the court was whether defendant operated her vessel &quot;in a careful and prudent manner.&quot; The court held that ordinary care required for safe navigation meant adherence to the established rules of navigation governing vessels generally. Mere proof of an accident was not sufficient to sustain a conviction. The State had to prove a violation of &sect; 45(1) beyond a reasonable doubt. Determining that the State met its burden of proof, the court found that defendant did not have the right of way, and did not follow the proper rules for passing the vessel which did have the right of way. N.Y. Nav. Law &sect; 41(2) dictated the proper procedure for passing. Defendant did not follow the rules and did not operate her vessel in a careful and prudent manner. A mere violation of the rule might not have been enough for a conviction, but when coupled with other circumstances in that defendant did not slow the speed of the vessel when changing course, and did injure persons in the boat, which defendant's vessel collided with.</SPAN></P>

Upon completion of the job, the State paid the contractor, who failed to deposit the check and realized the mistake over six years later. The court allowed judgment in favor of the contractor. The court ruled that after three years from the date of the issuance of the check, if not presented for payment, the amount was to have been be paid into the Treasury of the State to the credit of the General Fund, and the Comptroller was required to keep a record of said check for a period of six years from the date thereof. The court found that the legislature passed the enabling act for the very reason that the contractor had failed to present the check within the six-year period. The court held that the legislature intended to prevent the State from becoming unjustly enriched after the contractor made a mistake. The court ruled that the enabling act was not unconstitutional because it was in the exercise of the legislature's wide discretion and founded in equity and justice.</SPAN></P>

The issue presented was whether at the time of first detention, the police had probable cause to believe that a felony had in fact been committed and had statutory authority to arrest. The court held that nothing which the officer observed justified suspicion of felony. No right of detention existed.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. While cruising in a police car in a well-to-do neighborhood, a police officer saw a young Puerto Rican carrying expensive-looking luggage. The officer stopped and questioned him.  Told that the luggage belonged to &quot;a friend&quot;, the officer took him and the luggage into the police car to locate the &quot;friend&quot; but found no such person.  The officer then delivered the young man and the luggage to a detective in the police station; and there the detective soon elicted from the young man a confession that he had broken into an automobile and had stolen the luggage. All this excellent police work transpired in about half an hour.  The young man is now charged with the felony of grand larceny.  On the above facts: (1) an arrest occurred when the young man and the luggage were placed in the police car; and at that time no probable cause had been found for an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arrest (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 177, subds. 3, 4); and (2) a search occurred at the same time, as an incident of the arrest, and it likewise was without probable cause (U. S. Const., 4th Amdt.; N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 12).  After a hearing, the court ordered that the seized evidence and defendant's confession both be suppressed (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 813-c).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Police have duties of crime prevention and detection, as well as apprehension.  They can approach and detain a suspect, and meanwhile observe him and his possessions at close range and briefly and perfunctorily question him, and they can meanwhile investigate at the scene or reasonably close to the scene. But when they detain him in the police station or elsewhere for questioning or while they investigate elsewhere, abuses of constitutional rights may occur.  The founders of our constitutional government believed that the citizen needs protection against law-breaking by law enforcers.  If the detention is not brief and perfunctory, the law will deem that an arrest occurred at the earliest beginning of the detention. Hence, if, at that earliest time, insufficient probable cause existed for an arrest and for a search as an incident&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the arrest, any evidence thus unconstitutionally obtained is inadmissible and must be suppressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Factually, three different types of situations occur in which the problem arises as to whether the police have probable cause to search and seize.  First, a felony has in fact been committed, and the police learn of it from the victim or their own observation or from fellow officers or reliable informants; in such case, a description of the person, or a suspect's furtive conduct near the scene of the felony, may give the police probable cause to arrest and search him (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 177, subds. 2, 3).  Second, police hear the sound of breaking glass or screams in the night or they receive a report that a trespasser is on a roof at a late hour, and they find a suspect emerging from the building or in the back yard or running away from the scene; in such situations, they may have probable cause to believe (a) that a felony has been committed and (b) that they are arresting and searching the person who committed the felony (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 177, subd. 4).  Where they have substantial information as to (a), less substantial information is required as to (b).  On the other hand, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  where (a) they hear from a reliable informer that narcotics are being sold at a certain place, this is not very substantial information that a felony as defined in our narcotics statutes has occurred; hence, (b) there must be evidence which approximates the actual commission of a felony within the officer's observation or presence (cf. Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 177, subd. 1).  Third, the police have no information that a felony has been committed, but they observe a person in the late hours carrying a quantity of furs or of clothing or of merchandise, with labels still affixed.  In such situation, they can briefly detain and question and observe the suspect, but they cannot search him.  Only if such brief questioning and observation produce probable cause to arrest and search him, can they then lawfully do so.  The situation in the instant case is in this third category.  The brief questioning of this defendant did not produce any probable cause to put him and the luggage into the police car and take him to the police station. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of violating &sect; 45(1) for operating his boat too close to swimmers. He appealed, arguing that the oral decision of the trial court at the time of judgment indicated doubt in the mind of the judge that the statute was violated.

Defendant also argued that there was no showing of danger to any identified persons and no complaints of dangerous operation of the boat from any swimmers or watchers on the shore.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners brought a declaratory judgment action against defendant town, contending, among other things, that the town's zoning ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to their property and that there were procedural defects in the adoption of various amendments to the ordinance. The court dismissed the claim regarding the constitutionality of the ordinance, but the claims regarding procedural defects remained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town adopted a resolution to amend the ordinance, stating that the ordinance was amended by substituting a map that was attached to the minutes of the town meeting. The town then published a copy of the notice and the zoning map in a local paper. In dismissing the property owners' complaint for declaratory judgment, the court held that the enactment of the amended map was properly published and posted in the local newspaper because the published materials were the same as those contained in the adopted resolution. The court rejected the property owners' argument that the ordinance could only be amended in words and figures and that the notice that referred to the map was legally insufficient. Instead, the court found that the resolution of adoption of the amended map was an &quot;ordinance&quot; within the meaning of N.Y. Town Law &sect;&sect; 264, 265 because the New York Town Law did not limit the method of changing a district boundary to an ordinance by stating the boundary in words and figures.

In this action by the owners of vacant land (1) to adjudge the zoning ordinance confiscatory and unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs' property and (2) to adjudge that amendments to the Zoning Ordinance were not properly adopted, the court dismissed cause (1) at the close of plaintiff's case, because plaintiffs failed to prove (a) their cost for the property or any other monetary proof, and (b) beyond a reasonable doubt that their property cannot be adapted to one-acre zoning or that the zoning is discriminatory or does not conform to a comprehensive plan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was brought to court on a parental petition. She was remanded to a facility for temporary detention. The mother and the child acquiesced to the recommendations that the child was in need of institutional care. The child did not profit from the program and she was permitted to return home. The issue was whether, under the Family Court Act, the court had been divested of all power to &quot;place&quot; in the State Training School for Girls a girl coming within the definition of a person in need of supervision. The court determined that a person in need of supervision was a category of delinquency as to which the legislature directed the substitution of the softer word &quot;place&quot; for &quot;commit&quot; and the review of those placements at the end of 18 months. The court explained that N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 756 provided that a person in need of supervision could be placed in an authorized agency, and a state institution was an authorized agency. The court placed the child in the State Training School for Girls pursuant to N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect;&sect; 119, 756.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- &quot;Person in need of supervision&quot; -- Family Court Act defined &quot;authorized agency&quot; to include State supported or controlled institution (&sect; 119) and Family Court could, therefore, (under &sect; 756) order &quot;placing&quot; in State Training School of habitually disobedient, chronically truant, parentally uncontrollable and sexually promiscuous girl who was within definition of &quot;Person in need of supervision&quot; although not &quot;Juvenile delinquent&quot; (&sect; 712) despite limitations of Social Welfare Law (&sect; 425 et seq.) to &quot;Juvenile delinquents&quot; and &quot;delinquents&quot; and to &quot;commitment&quot; rather than &quot;placement&quot;; such interpretation avoids construction raising doubts of unconstitutionality (N. Y. Const., art. VI, &sect; 13) and leading to unreasonable or harmful result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Family Court had power under the Family Court Act (eff. Sept. 1, 1962) to order the &quot;placing&quot; in a State Training School, as a &quot;Person in need of supervision&quot; (&sect; 712), of a girl under 18 years of age who was previously found to be habitually disobedient, parentally uncontrollable, chronically truant and sexually promiscuous, who had not profited from an experimental three-month period in a voluntary institution, and whose conduct&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  continued to deteriorate following her return home on probation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 712 defined a &quot;Juvenile delinquent&quot; as one under 16 &quot;who does any act which, if done by an adult, would constitute a crime&quot;, but further defined as a &quot;Person in need of supervision&quot; a boy under 16 or a girl under 18 &quot;who is an habitual truant or who is incorrigible, ungovernable or habitually disobedient and beyond the lawful control of parent or other lawful authority&quot;.  With respect to an adjudicated juvenile delinquent, section 753 authorized the court to order &quot;placing&quot; the child in an &quot;authorized agency&quot; (pursuant to &sect; 756) for 18 months or &quot;committing&quot; him to a State or other &quot;authorized agency&quot; for up to three years (pursuant to &sect; 758), but as to an adjudicated &quot;Person in need of supervision&quot;, section 754 provided only for &quot;placing&quot; (under &sect; 756) with no power given to &quot;commit&quot; (under &sect; 758).  However, during the course of legislative consideration of the Family Court Act a new section 119 was added which defined an &quot;authorized agency&quot; to include not only voluntary institutions but also those supported or controlled by the State or its subdivisions.  Accordingly, a &quot;Person in need of supervision&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  may be &quot;placed&quot; in a State institution -- an &quot;authorized agency&quot; (&sect; 756).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although provisions of the Social Welfare Law (&sect; 425 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) enacted before 1962 and dealing with State training schools, refer only to &quot;Juvenile delinquents&quot; and &quot;delinquents&quot; and not to &quot;Person in need of supervision&quot;, and to &quot;commitments&quot; rather than &quot;placements&quot;, the failure to conform the language of some sections of the Social Welfare Law was less indicative of legislative intent than the express inclusion of State training schools within the definition of &quot;authorized agencies&quot;.  If two or more interpretations of an ambiguous statute are permissible, the construction will be avoided which leads to an unreasonable, absurd or harmful result.  Inasmuch as voluntary institutions can accommodate only 25% or less of children requiring institutional care, so that the others must of necessity be accommodated in State training schools, although, as the State Department of Social Welfare has pointed out, 80% to 90% of the girls in the State institutions could not be defined as &quot;Juvenile delinquents&quot; because they have not committed acts which would constitute crimes, it is unreasonable to suppose that the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  statute was intended to give the court no alternative but to abandon these children in the open community in accordance with the interpretation by the Department which would limit admission to the State training schools to children adjudicated &quot;delinquent&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Moreover, a court, especially one of original jurisdiction, should seek to avoid a conclusion of unconstitutionality and any grave doubts thereupon, and provisions of the Constitution (N. Y. Const., art. VI, &sect; 13, as amd. in 1961) limit the Family Court's jurisdiction to actions and proceedings for the &quot;protection, treatment, correction and treatment of those minors who are in need of the exercise of the authority of the court because of circumstances of neglect, delinquency or dependency as the legislature may determine&quot;, whereas, if section 712 be interpreted to exclude a &quot;Person in need of supervision&quot; from the term &quot;delinquency&quot;, the court would be excluded from all jurisdiction over such cases.  To avoid such constitutional doubts, the term &quot;Person in need of supervision&quot; must be interpreted as a category of delinquency for which the Legislature directed a different label, a substitution of the softer word &quot;place&quot; for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;commit&quot;, and review of these placements after 18 months.  </SPAN></P>

The commission moved to dismiss the complaint for legal insufficiency and the landlord filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A landlord applied for a rent increase alleging that the property was not yielding the return allowed by law. While the application was pending, the rent control law was amended to provide that the current equalization rate was to be used to adjust the property's assessed valuation. The rent administrator issued orders for increases but before they took effect 1962 N.Y. Laws 21 was enacted nullifying increases based on the current equalization rate. The landlord complained that the rent administrator should have used the equalization rate in effect when the application for an increase was originally filed. The landlord argued that if the current equalization rate was correctly applied, then the 1962 act was unconstitutional because it arbitrarily and unreasonably destroyed its vested rights in the increases. The court dismissed the landlord's complaint because the rent administrator had no discretion to apply the former equalization rate and rollbacks of rent increases were constitutional. A landlord had no vested right to application of the rules in effect when an application for an increase was filed even where the application had proceeded to the point of favorable action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been charged with violating the city health code by failing to supply sufficient heat to his residential buildings, to which he pled guilty. A city magistrate determined that defendant was in a state of idiocy, imbecility, or insanity so that he was incapable of understanding the proceedings against him, and therefore, ordered that defendant be committed to the hospital for psychiatric examination pursuant to N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 870. Defendant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus seeking his release from commitment. The court sustained the writ and ordered that defendant be remanded to the prison warden so that he could be produced for sentencing. The court held that a magistrate had authority to order a defendant to commitment, but that such an order had to be based on reasonable grounds. The court found that the record did not support a reasonable belief that defendant was subject to commitment. The court found that defendant's failure to provide heat could be considered cruel, callous, and selfish, but his actions did not rise to the level of idiocy, imbecility, or insanity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. When there is reasonable ground to believe that a defendant charged with offenses which are not crimes (N. Y. City Health Code, &sect; 131.03; N. Y. City Crim. Cts. Act, &sect; 102-c [now &sect; 95]) is in such a mental state that he is incapable of understanding the charge or proceeding or of making his defense, the court or Magistrate may order such defendant to be examined to determine the question of his sanity (Code Crim.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Even aside from statutory authority, such an order&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of commitment is within the inherent juridical competence of a duly constituted criminal court having appropriate jurisdiction, since one held on a criminal charge should not be tried, sentenced or punished while he is incapable of making a defense or of understanding the proceeding (Penal Law, &sect; 1120).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is no right to a jury trial on the issue of such defendant's mental competence.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Whether the maximum period of 60 days provided for in the commitment order herein would be unreasonable need not be decided as the instant writ of habeas corpus was obtained within one day after the directed hospitalization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Commitment of a defendant for mental observation does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment (U. S. Const., 8th, 14th Amdts.; N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 5).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. An exercise of discretion by one having jurisdiction will not be reviewed by way of a writ of habeas corpus.

Accordingly, the writ is sustained and defendant is released from the hospital commitment and remanded for sentence in pursuance of his pleas of guilty to the offenses charged.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff, a stockholder of defendant, commenced this action pursuant to section 977-b of the Civil Practice Act to obtain the appointment of a permanent receiver of the New York assets of defendant, a corporation organized under the laws of Cuba.  Section 977-b authorized a stockholder to commence such action when the corporation had assets within the State and (a) it had been nationalized, or (b) its charter had been suspended or revoked, or (c) it ceased to do business.  Defendant conducted extensive business enterprises in Cuba prior to June 3, 1959.  On that date and thereafter various properties of defendant located in Cuba were seized.  On&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  July 6, 1960, Cuba enacted Law No. 851 which conferred authority upon its president &quot;to nationalize, through forced expropriations, the properties or 'Empresas' owned by physical and corporate persons who are nationals of the United States * * * or of the 'Empresas' in which such physical and corporate persons have an interest, even though they be organized under the Cuban laws.&quot; Provision was made for payment through bonds.  Resolution No.  1 enacted on August 6, 1960 nationalized the &quot;property and empresas&quot; of defendant.  As a result thereof, all activities of defendant in Cuba, and its right and capacity to control its enterprises there terminated.  Despite plaintiff's claim that the word &quot;empresas&quot; meant &quot;corporate or juridical entity&quot;, the effect of the resolution was to vest in the Cuban State the corporate properties and control of the enterprises in Cuba.  The evidence supported the view that the corporations continued to exist and that payment for the properties expropriated would ultimately be made, not to the stockholders, but to the corporation itself.  The evidence supported the view that the termination of defendant's right to pursue its enterprises in Cuba would not, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under Cuban law, deprive defendant of the right to do business elsewhere.  Accordingly defendant corporation had not been dissolved, liquidated or nationalized, and its charter had not been suspended or revoked within the meaning of section 977-b of the Civil Practice Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The cessation of defendant's business caused by the intervention of a temporary receiver did not mean that defendant had ceased doing business.  Defendant maintained its New York office; its officers resided in the United States; it entered into new employment contracts; it conserved its assets; its board of directors met regularly; it paid creditors; it sought out new business opportunities; it maintained its memberships in trade organizations and it made claim against the Cuban Government through the United States Department of State for in excess of $ 93,000,000.  All these activities established that defendant had not ceased to do business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Judgment was granted defendant dismissing the complaint, vacating the temporary receivership and directing the receiver to account.  </SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 997.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department asserted that it had not received notice of the pending eviction proceeding from the tenant, and asserted that the tenant had a valid defense to eviction for non-payment under the newly-enacted &sect; 143-b. The court held that &sect; 143-b violated the due process rights of the landlord under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court noted that &sect; 143-b established building violations which were dangerous or detrimental to life or health as a defense to non-payment by welfare recipients. The court found that the statute was motivated by a worthy goal, and noted that the state had authority to prevent such violations under its police power. The court held that the landlord's contract to rent the premises was a property right within the scope of the Fifth Amendment, and the statute would prohibit the landlord from recovering a money judgment for back rent during a time when the tenant enjoyed possession, thus violating the landlord's contract rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor sought to erect houses in a town on plots of land that were of a peculiar shape. The town adopted an amendment to is zoning ordinance, Town of Hempstead, N.Y., Zoning Ordinance &sect; B-10.1, which intended to prohibit similar layouts of land. The contractor filed applications for building permits, but they were refused as not being in compliance with &sect; B-10.1. The contractor claimed that &sect; B-10.1 was unconstitutional and void because it illegally delegated to the planning commission power to enact zoning legislation for the town. He also claimed that it was invalid because it imposed restrictions on the frontage of plots beyond those fixed by N.Y. Town Law &sect; 280-a(5). The court held that there was no unlawful delegation. Under N.Y. Town Law &sect; 280-a(5), the commission could not effectively approve a subdivision plat unless the access standards were met. Nothing in N.Y. Town Law &sect; 280-a indicated any legislative intention to prohibit the town from enacting higher standards for street frontage of building plots than those prescribed by &sect; 280-a.</SPAN></P>

On the issue of the sufficiency of the information, the court noted that there was no description of the type of machines used, nor was their number or their nature set forth. Further, there were no facts as to the scope, volume, or other characteristics of the business conducted on the premises.

If an administrative agency had the power to reconsider and review without limit, there never would be an end to administrative procedure or litigation.

The commission acted inappropriately while the action was under review on appeal by issuing another order denying de novo the certificate of eviction. Over the landlord's protest, an order of the court directed a remission for further consideration by the commission. The city rent and rehabilitation administrator succeeded to the commission's jurisdiction and had not issued her determination. The court held that the proceedings before the commission should be brought to an end. As the landlord's application for a certificate was before the commission following a court order, such power residing in the court, the action for declaratory judgment was not entertained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chairmen of the county political committees contended that the voters of the county were entitled to elect a family court judge pursuant to a resolution that the county filed with the Secretary of State in July 1962, creating a judicial vacancy under the N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 131. The court, however, concluded that &sect; 131(a) excluded the normal operation of the statute where a certificate was filed subsequent to March 1, 1962. The court stated that the legislature had established a cut-off date of March 1, 1962 for the creation of new children's court judgeships under &sect; 131 due to the rapid increase in the number of new judgeships being created. The court also concluded that N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 131(a) was not unconstitutional because N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 13 did not require a separate family court judge in each county. The court recognized the strong presumption in favor of the constitutionality of a statute and refused to substitute its judgment for that of the legislature. While the petition under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 was a proper method to challenge the constitutionality of the statute due to the exceptional public nature of the case, it was without merit.</SPAN></P>

Act. art. 78 seeking a mandamus order to require respondent New York Secretary of State to accept the voters' independent nominating petitions for candidates to be voted for by all state voters without regard to the requirement in N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 138(5)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters challenged N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 138(5)(a), which required that an independent nominating petition for candidates to be voted for by all the voters in the State had to be signed by at least 12,000 voters, of whom at least 50 had to reside in each county of the State. The voters argued that the minimum requirement for each county was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and other state and federal constitutional provisions. The court concluded that although mandamus was only an appropriate remedy for a wrong already suffered and not to prevent an anticipated wrong, that in exceptional and extraordinary cases involving duties of public officers in matters of a public nature the proceeding would be allowed. The court, however, upheld the validity of &sect; 138, holding that the State had the power to assure a proper diffusion of political initiative between thinly populated counties and those having concentrated masses. There was no invidious discrimination involved. The statutory scheme was rational and was a reasonable attempt to achieve the State's objective.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the search was made without a search warrant and although probable cause to arrest existed, the search was not incidental to and contemporaneous with an arrest. The court found that defendant was not arrested until many days later and that such a search without a search warrant and not incidental to an arrest was a general search and therefore unreasonable. The court held that defendant had standing to seek suppression of the evidence. The court found that at the hearing the police officer testified that the fixed premises, a secondhand automobile lot, was registered in the name of defendant's brother. The investigation that led to the search sought to establish that in fact the licensed premises were being operated by defendant in his brother's name, that in fact, defendant was the true owner and operator and in this connection there was evidence that he was &quot;employed&quot; on the lot for long periods.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a proceeding against respondent state mental hospital superintendent, relator state mental hospital inmate was granted a writ of habeas corpus on which he sought his release from the Matteawan State Hospital on the grounds that he is sane and that the statute under which he was transferred to Matteawan, N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 412 (1929, amended 1959), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that his continued was illegal because there were no criminal charges pending. In considering his petition, the court ruled that the lack of pending criminal charges did not invalidate his detention. Under N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 412, someone who was validly committed to a mental hospital, who was previously sentenced to imprisonment, and who still manifested criminal tendencies, was property transferred on an administrative order from the mental hygiene commissioner. The court concluded that the inmate was validly confined, was previously committed to a corrections department institution, and remained insane. The court also reaffirmed that &sect; 412 was constitutional. In addition, the court ruled that with an administrative transfer, there had to be some guarantee or assurance that it was not made capriciously or arbitrarily. The determination was also subject to review through the remedy of habeas corpus. Any administrative inconvenience in the availability of the habeas procedure was not a justification for its denial. The court determined that remand was necessary because the record did not delineate what conduct by the inmate formed the basis for the transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the matter for a further hearing, and it ordered the state mental hospital superintendent to file an amended return setting forth in detail the acts and conduct of the inmate that allegedly constituted the manifestation of continued criminal tendencies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 412 of the Correction Law, providing for the transfer to Matteawan State Hospital of a person committed to a State mental hospital who has been previously sentenced to a term of imprisonment in correctional institution and who still manifests criminal tendencies, is not unconstitutional.  Relator is not deprived of his liberty by reason of his transfer, pursuant to this section, from a hospital under the jurisdiction of the Department of Mental Hygiene to one under the control of the Department of Correction. In each instance his detention depends on the continuance of his insanity, an issue which he may question at any time by habeas corpus. The fact that relator may be more restricted, may enjoy fewer privileges&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and would be confined with dangerous persons at Matteawan is not sufficient to warrant a declaration that section 412 is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The transfer provided for by section 412 is, by the provisions of that section, effected by administrative order of the Commissioner of Mental Hygiene. However, the remedy of habeas corpus is available to an inmate who claims his transfer to be wrongful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It is established by the testimony of a licensed psychiatrist that relator is still insane. However, since the conduct on his part which was the basis for the transfer is not disclosed in the present record the matter is remanded for a further hearing on this matter.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought a declaratory judgment action against defendants, seeking a declaration that N.Y. Educ. Law art. 148 was unconstitutional. Article 148 created the profession of &quot;landscape architecture&quot; and invoked criminal penalties for those who engaged in the proscribed conduct without a license. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint as insufficient in law. The court concluded that the issue of constitutionality was properly raised. Article 148 contained no guideposts for the relevant professional board to follow in reaching a decision as to the &quot;grade and character&quot; of work acceptable to them, and authorization given to an administrative officer to choose without providing a measure or standard for such classification was beyond the power of the legislature. The article gave no clear guidance to aid the average person in deciding what conduct was criminal and what was not. Assuming that the conduct involved constituted a legitimate area for legislative regulation, it did not warrant the sweeping and unnecessary interference with harmless pursuits that the article accomplished.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 148 of the Education Law makes it a misdemeanor to perform after July 1, 1961 various acts which are rather uncertainly defined as the practice of &quot;landscape architecture&quot; without a license. In such an innocuous field, such uncertainty in a statute as to criminality may deprive persons of due process and may be an improper use of the State's police powers.  The statute requires licenses, and requires applicants for licenses to take examinations, and authorizes the examining board to license or to refuse to license persons already in such practice, depending on whether their experience has been &quot;of a grade and character acceptable to the board&quot; and provided that such persons apply to the board before July 1, 1961 (Education Law, &sect; 7323, subd. 3).  The statute's standards of what shall be &quot;acceptable to the board&quot; are not definite (N. Y. Const., art.  III, &sect; 1).  Plaintiffs are persons already in practice, to whom the board has denied licenses. Plaintiffs ask for a declaratory judgment of unconstitutionality.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a county and a county treasurer, filed suit against defendants, a surrogate of the county and others, challenging the constitutionality of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged unconstitutionality was based on N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 16. In the case at bar, the court was dealing with an area, namely the administration of decedents' estates, the regulation of which was essentially a state function, as witnessed New York Surrogate's Court Act, which was uniformly applicable throughout the state, and yet plaintiffs contended this was exclusively a matter of county government. The court thought it clear that the legislation was not concerned with county &quot;organization&quot; or &quot;government.&quot; By the creation of the office of public administrator who, under N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc. Act Law &sect; 118, had an absolute priority over the county treasurer, the county treasurer could in no sense be said to have been deprived of fees which he had not earned and the very right to which depended upon a future discretionary act by the surrogate. The court was of the opinion that N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc. Act Law &sect; 125-b(14) was unconstitutional in its entirety. However, the court was further of the opinion that it might be excised from the rest of the law without doing violence to its purpose, even though the act did not contain a separability clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted plaintiffs' motion for a temporary injunction as to estates in which the county treasurer had been appointed administrator and was presently acting as such.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Town of Ramapo, New York, brought an action against defendant villages for a judgment declaring unconstitutional 1961 N.Y. Laws 88, which amended 1936 N.Y. Laws 526, &sect; 2(A) to allow the Town to enter into an agreement with any village wholly or partly within its limits and that maintained its own police department to provide for apportionment of the cost of the Town's police department. The Town moved for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both villages maintained police departments. The Town entered into an agreement that provided the villages with apportioned exemptions, expressly stating that if 1961 N.Y. Laws 88 was held to be unconstitutional, the Town was to be reimbursed for the amount of the exemptions. The court held that the Town was not estopped from challenging the constitutionality of 1961 N.Y. Laws 88 by virtue of having voluntarily entered into the agreement. The agreement recited that the Town had been advised that 1961 N.Y. Laws 88 might have been unconstitutional and expressly provided for reimbursement in that event. Rather than waiving its rights, the Town expressly reserved them. The Town was a proper party to bring the declaratory judgment action, as it was a party to the agreement. However, 1961 N.Y. Laws 88 was not unconstitutional.&nbsp;N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 1 provided that tax exemptions could only be granted by general laws. N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 17 barred the passage of a private or local bill granting an exemption for taxation on property. 1961 N.Y. Laws 88 did not grant an exemption. It attempted to equalize assessments to defray the cost of performing a necessary municipal function.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- apportionment of cost of Police Department -- plaintiff town entered into agreement with defendant villages, located wholly or partly within town, granting them apportionment of cost of Police Department of town, pursuant to chapter 88 of Laws of 1961, because villages maintained their own departments; in action by town to declare </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> unconstitutional,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> defense that town is estopped from bringing action or waived right is insufficient -- plaintiff town has right to remedy of declaratory judgment because of continuing controversy with villages and residents of town other than in villages -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> since it does not grant tax exemption to villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Pursuant to chapter 88 of the Laws of 1961, which authorized a town of the first class in Rockland County to enter into an agreement with villages wholly or partly within the town, which maintained their own&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police Departments, to provide for apportionment of the cost of the town Police Department between the village and the remainder of the town, plaintiff town entered into agreements with defendant villages in December, 1961 granting defendant villages exemptions from their normal assessments for town police services, and then commenced this action for judgment declaring chapter 88 unconstitutional.  A defense that plaintiff is estopped from questioning the validity of the contract or has waived its right to do so is insufficient.  Defendants were not misled.  They were warned by a provision in the contract that plaintiff doubted the legality of the statute, and they agreed that the town be reimbursed if the statute should be declared unconstitutional. The implication was that the statute would be judicially tested.  The town did not waive its rights, but expressly reserved them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The remedy of an action for declaratory judgment is available to plaintiff.  There is an existing controversy in which the villages sought tax exemption. The agreement made favored the villages as against residents of other portions of the town, but with the distinct reservation that the question of legality&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be determined.  Plaintiff, as one of the parties to a doubtful contract is the proper party to test its legality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The purpose of the statute is to protect the citizens of a village which maintains an adequate police force from the burden of double taxation. The general law pertaining to other counties contained in section 150 of the Town Law did not apply to Rockland County because the town Police Department had been created by special act. Chapter 88 was enacted to grant villages in Rockland County the same rights as villages elsewhere.  The statute does not grant tax exemption by special act and does not violate section 1 of article XVI of the Constitution.  Defendants are granted judgment dismissing the complaint.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the French National Railroads, filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff New York resident's complaint for personal injuries sustained while a passenger on a train owned by the railroads.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New York resident sustained personal injuries while a passenger on one of the railroads' trains while visiting France. He was reboarding the train when he fell off. As a result, both of his legs were amputated, and he suffered other painful injuries. The New York resident filed a complaint against the railroads in New York for his personal injuries. The railroads filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, claiming that the New York court's jurisdiction over the action would constitute an undue burden on the foreign commerce of a transportation company in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and that the New York resident was required to assert his rights in the courts in France. The court dismissed the railroads' motion, holding that the exercise of jurisdiction by a court in New York would not represent an undue burden on the railroads. The court ruled that New York was the appropriate forum because it was financially impossible for the New York resident to bring the suit in France, there was grave risk to his health, and the railroads conducted business in New York.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the railroads' motion to dismiss the New York resident's complaint to recover for personal injuries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. No unreasonable burden was placed on foreign commerce by the entertainment by the courts of New York of an action by a resident of New York to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff in France while a passenger on a train of defendant foreign corporation, allegedly caused by defendant's negligence.  That New York was the proper forum was shown by the fact that plaintiff's poverty prevented bringing suit in France, that he was physically incapacitated from bringing suit in France without grave risk to his health, that defendant conducted extensive operations in New York, and that defendant solicited plaintiff's business in New York and advised him concerning his travel in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A provision of French law which required plaintiff to assert his rights against defendant in the courts of France did not prevent plaintiff from asserting his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rights in New York.  The remedy available under French law was not different from the remedy available in a negligence action in New York.  The convenience of defendant was served by such provision of the French law and no reason to prefer defendant's convenience existed.  Moreover, the court was not bound to enforce the foreign provision limiting the venue of an action brought to enforce a foreign right.  </SPAN></P>

The court noted court of appeals decisions that stated that freezes and rollbacks of rent increases were historically and constitutionally acceptable and that the state rent control statute did not contemplate a taking of the property of any landlord and even though it might, on occasion, compel an owner to operate his real property at a loss, the statute was not for that reason to be condemned as an arbitrary use of the police power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The college explained its refusal to permit the use of the auditorium by saying that, after reading the editor's opening remarks, the dean formed the opinion that political issues were involved and the college was enjoined from allowing the use of its premises by political groups. The journal had previously been permitted to use the auditorium and the editor argued that, although there was no duty to make the college available for nonacademic uses, once having made it available, the regulations had to meet constitutional standards. The court struck the regulations and ordered that new ones be enacted. The court found that the regulations were either so vague as to invite discriminatory and arbitrary regulations, or else rested upon a classification of uses which stifled the free discussion of vital public issues. The court determined that a decision as to whether a program was permissible depended on a determination outside the scope of the regulation. The court concluded by forbidding the college from denying discussion of public issues from its halls on the ground that it was the voice of a minority or the voice of one not approved by an official acting under the regulations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees contended that they were entitled to additional holiday, vacation, and time off compensation based on the arbitrators' determination that the employees were not independent contractors and were, in fact, entitled to the benefits provided under the collective bargaining agreement negotiated between the employees' union and the employer.

The court granted the employer's motion to dismiss based on its determination that the employees were bound by the arbitration provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. They were required to pursue their claims by way of arbitration as required by the agreement and could not maintain an independent action. The court had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action to enforce the arbitration award.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife sued for separation from defendant second husband on the ground of abandonment and nonsupport. The husband, while conceding that he had abandoned her, claimed that such abandonment was justified because it occurred as soon as he discovered that an Alabama divorce procured by the wife from her first husband was void and he counterclaimed for a decree of annulment of the marriage to the wife on that basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The second husband claimed to have abandoned the wife upon learning that her divorce from her first husband was obtained during a one-week stay in Alabama. Because neither party thereto was domiciled or intended to be domiciled in Alabama, the second husband claimed that the resulting decree was arguably void. The court ruled that the test to be applied to determine whether the second husband, as a &quot;stranger&quot; to the divorce degree, was entitled to collaterally attack it in New York depended on whether he would be permitted to attack the decree in a court in Alabama, the logic being that the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution, U. S. Const., art. IV, &sect; 1, required the court to give the same deference to the Alabama decree as it would be given in the state in which it was issued. Noting that the Alabama court did not obtain jurisdiction over the marital res at any time, the court ruled that the Alabama court would have permitted a collateral attack on the decree for lack of jurisdiction. That being the case, a collateral attack by a &quot;stranger&quot; like the second husband was permissible and the second husband was entitled to have the marriage annulled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the second husband was entitled to collaterally attack the Alabama divorce decree obtained by his wife and her first husband; that the Alabama divorce decree was void for lack of jurisdiction; that the second husband was entitled to a decree annulling his marriage to the wife; and that the wife was not entitled to support.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner religious corporation sought an order directing respondent Mayor of the City of North Tonawanda, New York to issue it and its agents a permit to solicit funds in the City of North Tonawanda to promote its religious and social projects, and an order restraining the mayor from prohibiting the dissemination of religious literature in the city and from prohibiting certain agents of the corporation from soliciting funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agents of the corporation applied to the city for a solicitor's permit under the City of Tonawanda, New York Ordinance &sect; 4. The mayor notified the city attorney that the application was disapproved. No reason was assigned for disapproval. The ordinance in question was mandatory and a permit had to be issued upon the mayor finding that the applicant was qualified under the ordinance. No other standards were set forth in the ordinance. The issue before the court was whether a municipality in the exercise of its inherent police power could have refused a permit. Municipal corporations were allowed, under their police power, to regulate and license solicitation of the type in question where these activities were noncommercial and involved the spreading of religious faith. Such licensing was strictly limited to that required by essential police regulation of the particular activities. Since &sect; 4 contained no standard and no criteria to govern the issuance of permits for solicitation it was denied without valid legal reason, and denial of the permit exceeded the police power which the city was allowed to exercise in the regulation of religious activities and nonprofit enterprises.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the corporation the permit sought and the mayor was directed to issue permits to the certain agents of the corporation to solicit funds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner sought a declaratory judgment invalidating an ordinance that rezoned certain property as a municipal high rise housing district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In five causes of action the landowner attacked the ordinance that rezoned certain property for multi-family, high rise, dwellings, because it was &quot;spot zoning,&quot; it was enacted pursuant to agreement with the Division of Housing and the Glen Cove Housing Authority and constituted &quot;zoning by contract,&quot; it was confiscatory, the notice of hearing was insufficient, and the area rezoned was insufficiently described in the ordinance. The court held that the spot zoning claim was sustained. The landowner had the burden of showing that the ordinance was invalid was sufficient to entitle the to proceed to trial. The landowner's claims that the ordinance constituted zoning by contract and that it was confiscatory did not stand. An ordinance rezoning land pursuant to a housing plan had to have been enacted in conformance with the procedure established by the appropriate enabling statute. If the notice was ambiguous and misleading, adoption of the ordinance would not conform to N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 83 and defendant city's ordinance.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action wherein plaintiffs sought a judgment declaring that an ordinance rezoning certain property as a &quot;Municipal High Rise Housing District&quot; was invalid, plaintiffs, in the first cause of action, alleged that the ordinance constituted spot zoning. Section 155 of the Public Housing Law provided that &quot;All projects shall be subject to the planning, zoning * * * laws * * * applicable in the municipality in which the project is situated&quot;.  The planning and zoning laws applicable in defendant city included subdivisions 24 and 25 of section 20 of the General City Law.  Subdivision 25 required that zoning regulations be adopted &quot;in accord with a well considered plan&quot;.  An ordinance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rezoning a particular site was invalid if it failed to conform to such plan.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The second cause of action, wherein plaintiffs alleged that the ordinance was enacted pursuant to agreement with the Division of Housing and the Glen Cove Housing Authority and this constituted zoning by contract was insufficient.  Express permission was granted by section 99 of the Public Housing Law for a municipality to enter into an agreement with an authority or housing company to rezone any section in aid of public housing projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A third cause of action wherein plaintiffs alleged that the ordinance was confiscatory was sufficient.  A zoning ordinance which deprived a property owner of all use of his land for an indefinite period of time was unconstitutional.  Plaintiffs could treat this rezoning as an invasion of their property rights until such time as the city took their property in eminent domain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A fourth cause of action wherein plaintiffs alleged that the notice of hearing with respect to the rezoning ordinance was insufficient was good.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff water utility company and defendant city both sought summary judgment in the company's action to recover reimbursement costs for relocation of pipes and hydrants in conjunction with road construction pursuant to its contract with the city.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city entered into a contract with the company, for the company's provision of water to the city for fire extinguishment and other purposes. A subsequent amendment obligated the city to reimburse the company for the cost of relocation of the company-owned mains, pipes and hydrants where the city changed the line or grade of any street. When the parties disagreed about relocation costs associated with reconstruction of a road, they agreed that the company would accomplish the relocation without waiver of the rights of either party regarding liability. When the city refused to pay the company's claim, it instituted an action for recovery. The court granted summary judgment to the company, holding that: 1) the contract between the company and the city for provision of water, which included reimbursement of relocation costs, was valid; 2) the agreement was not unconstitutional; 3) no express statutory authority to reimburse the company was necessary because state courts had sanctioned such reimbursement when it rested on a contract; and 4) the company's contract was with the city, and it was not obligated to look elsewhere for reimbursement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Since 1925 plaintiff water company has supplied water to defendant city for fire extinguishment and other fire purposes.  Contracts were from time to time executed by the parties by the terms of which defendant agreed to reimburse plaintiff for expenses incident to the relocation of mains and hydrants and which provided that defendant would notify plaintiff if it planned to change the grade of any city street; that plaintiff would thereupon notify defendant of &quot;resettings, replacements and repairs made necessary thereby&quot; and of the estimated cost thereof, and that defendant would be responsible for the excess of this cost over $ 600 if it instructed plaintiff to proceed with the work.  Defendant cannot now claim that its agreement to reimburse the company for relocation of mains, hydrants and appurtenances was without consideration and that it had no power to pay for that for which plaintiff was obligated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to pay under its charter as a public utility corporation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town adopted an ordinance that placed the owner's property in a residential and agricultural zone. The ordinance provided that any lawful use in existence at the time, such as the owner's business, could be continued, expanded, or changed to another use. The court disagreed with the town's claim that the owner did not have a right to expand upon his business use as planned. The ordinance as originally enacted provided that right. However, the town amended the ordinance to prohibit such expansion. The owner argued that the amended ordinance was invalid because it did not provide for the notice required by N.Y. Town Law &sect; 264 to adjoining municipalities that had affected property owners within 500 feet of the town borders. The court agreed. The owner had a property right, which was directly and adversely affected by the amendment, and he had a right to challenge defects in the ordinance. In light of the lack of notice, the court granted summary judgment to the owner.</SPAN></P>

While the State Department of Public Works approved the plans and specifications, there was no precise statute authorizing the state to pay any part of the cost. The legislature passed an enabling act to pay a portion of the cost of the bridge. The entire length of the bridge was 399.2 feet and 121 feet thereof was over state canal lands. The total cost of the bridge was $ 381,246.89. The state's share was $ 115,517.84. At the close of trial, the State sought dismissal on the grounds that the enabling act was unconstitutional. The court found the act constitutional, holding that it was within the competence of the legislature to validate retrospectively any action it might prospectively authorize.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff township filed an action in the court, seeking through the injunctive process to enforce an amortization provision in its building zone ordinance against the nonconforming use by defendant property owners of their land as a junk yard and automobile wrecking business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue by way of defense was the constitutionality of the township's zoning ordinance, which had prohibited the use of any land in the town for a junk yard or automobile wrecking business. By his will, a decedent had devised his real property to defendants, his three sons, and had bequeathed his interest in the junkyard business to two of his sons, with the direction and request that defendants conduct the junkyard and automobile wrecking business jointly, as they had done since his death. The property was later zoned as residential and no effort had previously been made to terminate the nonconforming use, which had begun when the land was unzoned. The court determined that defendants had well-recognized legal property rights, which had to be protected by the court. The recital of the facts demonstrated the substantial loss that would have attached had the ordinance been enforced against defendants. As a matter of fact, application of the ordinance would have been tantamount to terminating the business of defendants without compensation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A town's zoning ordinance, since January 20, 1930, prohibited the use of any land for an automobile wrecking business and provided that any automobile junk yard in existence in a residence district be discontinued at the end of three years.  Defendants' land had been used as an automobile junk yard since 1926.  In this action by the town to enforce such ordinance by injunction, the complaint was dismissed.  Defendants had a valuable property right in the land and buildings.  They had equipment valued at $ 28,000 and $ 10,000 of inventory. The business could not be relocated because no land in the county was available which could be used for such business, the good will of which was $ 22,000.  The cost of relocating the business into one town which permitted such use as a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  special exception in an industrial district was at least $ 10,000.  To enforce the ordinance would be tantamount to terminating defendants' business without compensation.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village sought to intervene in an action brought by a landowner against a town over zoning of land that abutted the village. The village claimed that rezoning would result in the erection of numerous dwellings on the landowner's property and that even though the dwellings would be outside the village's limits, the village would be affected by the increased use of its services and facilities. The court denied the motion to intervene. The court held that there was no factual showing that the town would omit any duty imposed upon it by law with respect to the zoning. Furthermore, the court noted that it was not clear that the village would be bound by the judgment in the action. The court held that the fact that the village, as an abutting property owner, would be affected by rezoning did not furnish a basis for intervention.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The builder applied to the planning commission for approval of its development plans. Pursuant to its code, the village required the builder to pay the village for a village park, playground and recreational facilities in lieu of such facilities being provided for in the plans of the builder. The builder made payment accordingly. However, N.Y. Town Law &sect; 277, which was virtually identical to the village code, was found to be unconstitutional. Thereafter, the builder demanded the return of the funds, to which the village did not respond. The builder instituted an action to recover the funds, and defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the action was time-barred pursuant to N.Y. Village Law &sect; 341-b. The court denied the motion because that section applied only to actions in contract and in tort, where as the action here was for monies had and received, which was quasi-contractual and arose by operation of law, not out of a contract.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs challenged the validity of Section 85-2.1 of Vol. II of the Municipal Code of the City of Rochester, New York, that prohibited the use of rope-geared, hydraulic elevators for passenger transportation. Plaintiffs petitioned for an injunction pendente lite after the officials had expressed their intention to enforce the ordinance. The court granted plaintiffs' motion for the preliminary injunction based on its determination that (1) fairness and the absence of urgency dictated the issuance of the temporary restraint of enforcement until the ultimate rights of the parties could be determined at trial; (2) the ordinance denied equal protection by discriminating without just cause against the use of elevators of the identified type without satisfactory indication that passengers were in danger; (3) because the ordinance proscribed the elevator's use in contravention of plaintiffs' previously vested right to that use, the ordinance was not reasonable, absent a showing that the public need demanded the proscription; and (4) the officials did not substantiate their right to enforce the ordinance, which would result in irreparable financial hardship to plaintiffs, if enforced.</SPAN></P>

The ordinances could not be taken together to provide a reasonable period of 11 years within which to terminate the prior nonconforming use of plaintiffs' elevator. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner was a club organized for the purposes of moral and mental improvement of women and girls of a city; a portion of its activities were also allegedly devoted to educational and charitable purposes. The owner sought a property tax exemption on these grounds, but the exemption was denied. The owner then filed an action seeking declaratory judgment. The court held that in order for the owner to be entitled to the exemption, it had to show not only that it had been organized exclusively for charitable purposes, but also that its operations carried out such intent. The court held that the owner's certificate of incorporation stating the purpose of its formation was broad, and could have encompassed social and fraternal, as well as charitable, objectives. The court reasoned that proof that the owner had awarded three small scholarships, without additional proof as to how the owner was organized solely for benevolent purposes was insufficient to sustain its claim to exemption. In contrast, the court determined that the owner's primary activity was renting its property for profit, which defeated its claim to the exemption sought.</SPAN></P>
