<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant railroad appealed an order of the Beaufort County Superior Court (North Carolina) entering judgment for plaintiff landowner and requiring the railroad to build and maintain a new railroad crossing on the landowner's property at the spot requested by the landowner. The landowner sought to develop property on the western part of his farmland and requested the new crossing to obtain better access to the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The railroad argued that the evidence did not support the factual findings and that the landowner was not entitled to the new crossing under any state statute, including the cattle guard statute,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 62-226 (1989) or the cartway statute,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 136-69 (1986). The court found that the findings of fact did support the trial court's findings. However, it reversed because there was no legal authority that a landowner, holding land subject to an easement by the railroad, could direct a railroad as to the location of a new railroad crossing. There was no statutory or common-law authority to support that proposition. The railroad did have a duty to keep its crossings safe and if the existing crossing was inadequate for the safe passage of two way traffic, the landowner could file an action directing the railroad to upgrade the existing crossing. The cattle guard statute only applied to completely enclosed land and the cartway statute only applied when a petitioner was seeking access to a public road over the lands of another person.</SPAN></P>

During his trial, defendant's subpoena duces tecum for the victim's medical records was quashed.

Stat. &sect; 15A-903(d) (1988) because they were not in the possession of the state. The court noted that the information requested by defendant in the subpoena was too broad because it was a request for all of the victim's records. The trial court was not required to conduct an in camera inspection of the records requested because it was not evidence produced under &sect; 15A-903(d). The trial court properly allowed the lay testimony of the victim's mother under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C, N.C. R. Evid. 701 (1988). A counselor and a physician were properly qualified as expert witnesses and their opinions regarding sexual abuse of the victim was properly admitted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a citizens group and two individuals (group), and defendants, a corporation and the Department of Environment, Health and Natural Resources, appealed from the judgment of the Buncombe County Superior Court (North Carolina), which granted summary judgment in favor of the corporation and the department on some of the citizens group's claims under the constitution and environmental laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A corporation submitted an application for a mining permit to the department. The county board of commissioners (board) passed a resolution purporting to require the corporation to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS). The department ultimately issued the corporation a permit to operate a crushed stone quarry at the corporation's site. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the group. The court held that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to invalidate the permit because the group failed to exhaust the administrative remedies under the Administrative Procedure Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 150B-1 to -63, before seeking judicial review. Thus, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the group's claims that the board had authority to require an EIS, that the Mining Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 74-46 to -68, was unconstitutional, or that the department failed to abide by the Mining Act's requirements. The court held that the group's assignment of error to the trial court's order of summary judgment on the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims of the group was without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's order of summary judgment on the claims brought under the constitution and environmental laws by the group against the corporation and the department and affirmed the order of summary judgment in favor of the corporation and the department as to the group's civil rights claim. The case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a former husband, sought review of a judgment entered in the Mecklenburg County District Court (North Carolina) that found him in civil contempt of a prior consent judgment entered in a divorce action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A former husband was required to exchange residences with his former wife and pay her a sum of money as a distributive award under the terms of a consent judgment. When the husband did not pay the distributive award and left the residence in a damaged condition, the wife filed a motion to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of the consent judgment. On appeal of the trial court's decision that the former husband was in civil contempt, the court ruled that the evidence supported the lower court's findings that the husband had the present ability to comply with the order and that he was aware of and understood the order. The court also ruled that it was not required to examine whether his Fifth Amendment rights were adequately protected during the contempt proceeding because the relief granted was wholly civil in nature The court found that the trial court had the authority to award attorney fees to the former wife to enforce the original order of equitable distribution, but that the trial court erred in awarding compensatory damages to the former wife because such an award was not properly within the scope of the contempt proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that the former husband's failure to comply with the prior consent judgment was willful and that the former husband was in civil contempt, ruling that the trial court made sufficient findings of fact based on competent evidence. The court vacated that portion of the judgment awarding compensatory damages to the wife.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the testing regulation was consistent with its enabling legislation,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 20, art. 3. The court found no violation of equal protection under either U.S. Const. amend. XIV or N.C.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff corporation filed an action against defendants, manufacturers and insurer. The Johnston County Superior Court (North Carolina) granted a directed verdict against the corporation on the ground that the products liability statute of repose, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-50(6), barred the corporation's action. The trial court granted partial summary judgment to the manufacturers and the insurer on the issue of damages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation contended that the products purchased for use were the two drying ranges and that the corporation made the initial purchase for use of the ranges. The manufacturers and insurer argued that the product purchased for use was the pressure vessel that exploded and that the initial purchase for use was made by one manufacturer when it purchased the pressure vessels from another manufacturer to assemble them into drying ranges. The court held that the manufacturer's purchase of the component parts for the purpose of assembly into a drying range was not the &quot;initial purchase for use&quot; within the meaning of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-50(6). The corporation's purchase of the drying ranges for the purpose of manufacturing textiles was the &quot;initial purchase for use&quot; because manufacturing textiles was the ultimate or intended use of the product. The court found that the corporation's action against defendants was brought no more than six years after the date of the initial purchase for use.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers were denied a classification for property because they did not meet the description of shareholders required in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-277.2 et seq. The taxpayers argued that &sect; 105-277.2 et seq. violated the powers of the general assembly as granted under N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 2 and, therefore, was not in compliance with N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 and violated their equal protection rights. The court affirmed the classification, finding that the ownership distinctions of &sect; 105-277.2(4)b, (5a) satisfied the equal protection requirements of the state and federal constitutions. The taxpayers failed to show that the definition of &quot;individually owned&quot; contained in &sect; 105-277.2(4)b, (5a) was either arbitrary or capricious. They failed to &quot;negative every conceivable basis&quot; that could support the legislation. On the contrary, while &sect; 105-277.2 et seq. was not perfect, it was clear that the ownership requirements of the statute were rationally related to the ends the general assembly sought to accomplish: to provide a tax incentive to family foresters; to preserve the use of forest land; and to avoid a tax windfall for those not in need of such an incentive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a declaratory judgment action, plaintiff remaindermen under a will sought review of an order from the Craven County Superior Court (North Carolina), which, in a bench trial, entered an order in favor of defendant occupants of real property and concluded that the North Carolina Real Property Marketable Title Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47B et seq., extinguished the remaindermen's vested interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The remaindermen contended that they held a vested remainder in fee pursuant to a will of the occupants' grantor and that application of the Act so as to extinguish that interest violated the North Carolina and United States Constitutions. The court took note of the fact that the order which the remaindermen were appealing was interlocutory in nature but nevertheless elected to review the matter prior to a final determination because a substantial right was involved. In affirming the trial court's judgment in part and reversing it in part, the court held that the remaindermen's vested remainder in fee, which was not registered pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47B-4, was extinguished as to some, but not all, of the occupants. The court found their interest was preserved under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47B-3(1) where the will was revealed in the muniments of title in certain occupants' record chain of title and extinguished in instances where this was not the case. The court declined to rule on the remaindermen's challenge to the constitutionality of the Marketable Title Act because it had not been raised or considered in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision of the lower court in part and reversed the decision in part.

The court on appeal reversed the trial court's judgment based on its determination that there was no evidence that a private examination of the grantor wife had been conducted by a certifying officer and the acknowledgement was defective because the certification did not comply with N.C.

The court determined that the subject deed was therefore void and that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants because the trial court had incorrectly concluded that N.C.

Furthermore, the court found that the trial court erred when it reduced the amount of sanctions based on the diligence of new counsel. The court reasoned that that was no showing that the new lawyer's commendable qualities in any way affected the amount of time and money the attorney general's office was forced to devote to defending the action brought by the attorney.

The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the matter for further proceedings. Appellant's license had been revoked owing to multiple violations of the Ethical Principles of Psychologists, including not only specified enumerated ethical principles but also the preambles to those ethical principles. On appeal, the court held that the preambles were aspirational only and were not sufficiently precise enough to justify deprivation of one's license if one violated them. The court held that eight specified ethical principles were sufficiently precise to pass constitutional muster. It did not agree, however, that the evidence established that appellant committed all the violations charged to him. In view of the fact that respondent's decision was based in part upon impermissible factors, a remand for reconsideration was necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The advertising company brought an action challenging the validity of the ordinance as an arbitrary violation of due process of law. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the county, and on appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court held that the county had the authority to regulate signs under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 153A-340, as well as under the general police powers in N.C. Gen.

The off-premise/on-premise classification for signs was a constitutionally valid basis for regulation of outdoor signs.

There had been no collateral attack on the foreign judgments; to the contrary, defendant did not object to the lower court's finding that the foreign judgments were valid. Further, defendant's continuous and systematic contacts with this state satisfied the requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1-75.4(1)(d), 1-75.8(5) and constitutional requirements. Traditional motions of fair play and substantial justice were not offended by the assertion of jurisdiction over defendant because he had had substantial forum-related contacts over a period of years, including the preparation of tax returns, financial and property management, receipt of funds, and purchase of real estate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An undercover officer bought marijuana from defendant twice outside the &quot;green house,&quot; which had a reputation as a drug center. Defendant was charged and convicted of possession with intent to sell. On appeal, he alleged many grounds of judicial error. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court determined that although the officer's summaries should have been excluded as hearsay, the admission was not prejudicial error because as a direct sales case, the officer testified to the same information. The judge did not err in excluding evidence as irrelevant that another case involving another resident of the house had been dismissed. The trial judge erred in permitting irrelevant testimony regarding the courtroom presence of two women from the green house, but defendant did not show that its exclusion would have led to a different result. The judge did not abuse his discretion by not repeating certain instructions to the jury. The consecutive sentences were not cruel and unusual punishment.

The father denied paternity and claimed the trial court erred in determining that he had minimum contacts with the forum, that the statute conferring jurisdiction, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-17, was unconstitutional because it pre-determined the standard for minimum contacts thereby violated his due process rights, and that he was denied a hearing to determine his contacts with the forum. The court affirmed the judgment. The test for determining whether personal jurisdiction was proper involved two parts: (1) had the statutes of the forum permitted the court to entertain the action; and (2) had the exercise of that power violated due process. The intent of &sect; 49-17 was not to abrogate the second prong of the test, rather it simply created special jurisdiction in situations where the act of sexual intercourse constituted sufficient minimum contact for the purpose of personal jurisdiction. The father was afforded an opportunity to provide evidence at the motion hearing, but made a tactical decision to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 49-17, and he was not entitled to another hearing when that tactical decision failed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that defendant received a fair trial, free from error. The court articulated that the state could regulate the length of a particular firearm as long as there was a reasonable purpose for doing so. The court opined that such a restriction did not give the legislature full license to restrict any and all firearms possessed by individuals. The court held that the state would have had to prove operability only if defendant had offered evidence of the weapon's inoperability.

The court held that the ordinance as applied by the city constituted an exaction and that a review of the trial court's judgment revealed that further evidence should be taken and findings made under the rational nexus test as applied to the city's subdivision ordinance;, thus, summary judgment was inappropriate in that regard. However, the court found that the developer had clearly requested, obtained, and accepted the benefits of the variance under the ordinance it was attacking and, therefore, was precluded from attacking the validity of the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The county had failed to show that the means employed were drawn so as not to infringe on the associational freedoms of persons who might sought the services of an escort. Therefore the ordinance as written was unconstitutional for being overbroad. In reversing the lower court, the court further concluded that the ordinance was vague and violated N.C. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the lower court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the search and seizure was arbitrary and unreasonable and thus violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and N.C.

Stat. &sect; 15A-255, an officer executing a warrant for the search of premises could search for weapons by a pat-down if the officer reasonably believed that it was required for his safety or for the safety of others. Thus, the court held that &sect; 15A-255 explicitly allowed the type of frisk that was conducted in the instant case. Defendant countered that the search and seizure was still unconstitutional because the agents executing the warrant determined in advance that they were going to frisk the lounge patrons. The court held that, had the agents fully searched the patrons, it would agree with defendant. However, the court found that the pat-down frisks were conducted solely for the safety of the officers and the patrons and were based on the officers' firsthand knowledge that patrons of the lounge often carried weapons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court entered the jury verdicts that found defendant guilty of resisting arrest. On appeal, defendant claimed that the evidence seized from his person was inadmissible because the initial stop of defendant's vehicle was unconstitutional, defendant's arrest was unconstitutional, and the search of defendant's person and the seizure were unconstitutional in that they were the products of the illegal detention. In affirming the trial court's decision, the court found that defendant waived his right to challenge the admissibility of the evidence that was seized from his person. In response to the contention that the arrest was illegal, the court found that the officers stopped the vehicle for the purpose of ascertaining defendant's identity. At the time of the investigatory detention, the officer mistakenly believed that defendant was another individual for whom arrest warrants had been issued. The officers were lawfully discharging a duty of their office when they asked defendant to identify himself.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court had deemed evidence obtained from the searches of defendant's house and of a car parked in the front yard to be admissible. On appeal, defendant argued that both searches were unlawful and that the evidence should have been suppressed. The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to suppress for several reasons. First, suppression was not required under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-974(1) because the failure to timely file the application and the search warrant with the clerk after the warrant was issued did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. Second, the information given to the magistrate was sufficient to find probable cause for the issuance of the warrant because the fact that the informant's statements had previously led to arrests was sufficient to show his reliability. Third, the car was within the curtilage of the house and was subject to search because it was parked 15 feet from the front door. Finally, the warrant was executed in accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-251 because the evidence indicated that the police officers could have reasonably believed that they were being denied access and that evidence was being destroyed.</SPAN></P>

The employee sued the employer, a tobacco company, alleging discrimination by her firing which she claimed was due to her being handicapped by asthma. The employee brought suit under the Handicapped Persons Act, which was repealed in 1985. A new Handicapped Persons Protection Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 168A-1 through 168A-12, was enacted at the same time. The employee was fired on 16 March 1984 and brought suit on 13 March 1987. The employer's summary judgment motion was granted. The dispositive issue in the case was whether the employee's claim was filed within a reasonable time after the former Handicapped Persons Act was repealed and the new act was enacted, with the result being that the statute of limitations for such actions was shortened from three years to 180 days. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the employee's action was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The court held that the employee had not filed suit within a reasonable period of time after the change so as to have tolled the statute for her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 96-13(a)(3) provided that an unemployed individual was eligible to receive benefits with respect to any week only if the Commission found that he was able to work and was available for work.

The court held that: (1) the undisputed facts demonstrated that the claimant never looked for work on more than one day each week and that although she generally made two job contacts each week, they were made on the same day; (2) a large measure of administrative discretion had to be granted to the ESC in the application of these terms in the statute to specific cases; (3) the facts supported the ESC's conclusion that claimant was not &quot;actively seeking work&quot; pursuant to N.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant injured brought an action alleging negligence, breach of warranty, and strict liability against appellee trucking companies for personal injuries resulting from an accident. The injury took place in New York. The lower court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee on the issue of choice of law, holding that North Carolina's statute of repose rather then New York law controlled the disposition in appellant's actions. Upon appeal, the court found that because the substantive law of New York controlled appellant's negligence and strict liability claims, and the statutes of repose were substantive provisions for purposes of choice of law, the trial court erred in applying North Carolina's statute of repose to these claims. The court held that appellant's breach of implied and express warranty claims, however, were governed by North Carolina law because the choice of law provision applicable to these claims appeared in the Uniform Commercial Code, N.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 113A-64 provided for a penalty of not more than $ 100 each day of a continuing violation under the Act. On appeal, the lower court determined sua sponte that the penalty arose from a legislative grant of judicial power prohibited by N.C. Const. art. IV, &sect; 3, although the issue was not raised as grounds for the appeal. The department contended that the lower court exceeded the scope of its review under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 150A-51. The court held that the scope of review was limited to the issues presented for review. The court found that although the constitutionality of the Act was not properly raised as an issue for the lower court's review, the court was permitted to exercise supervisory jurisdiction after the lower court addressed it. The court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 113A-64 of the Act was unconstitutional because it permitted an administrative agency to assess a civil penalty whose amount varied with the agency's discretion and such discretion was not reasonably necessary to accomplish the agency's created purposes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff county drainage district (district) appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court, Hertford County (North Carolina), which held inter alia that the court clerk was entitled to appoint commissioners or provide for their election to the drainage district, that the district was subject to the open meetings requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 143-318.10, and that the failure to levy annual assessments did not preclude their collection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court made rulings on various issues raised by the district in its action against the landowners. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court and held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 156-81(a) and (i) was constitutional in permitting the court clerk to appoint commissioners or to provide for their election by landowners to the drainage district. The court noted that the establishment of the district was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The district was subject to the open meetings requirements of &sect; 143-318.10, however, the failure to notify the landowners of meetings at which the assessments were levied did not deprive them of due process because they had available remedies which they failed to pursue. The court further noted that the district's failure to levy annual assessments did not preclude it from later collecting those assessments. The court reversed the taxing of costs against the district and also reversed the holding that the intervenors were entitled to assert the statute of limitations. The court indicated that as the action was not brought against them, they had no right to assert that defense. The award of attorney fees was vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated in part the trial court's rulings with respect to issues raised by the drainage district. The court reversed the intervenors' ability to assert the statute of limitations, the award of attorney fees and costs, and the holding that the delegation of authority to the court clerk regarding the appointment of commissioners was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An employee sued the manufacturer and the distributor of a product purchased by her employer, alleging that the manufacturer was negligent in introducing into the stream of commerce a product not suitable for the ordinary uses for which it was intended, in supplying a product which was unreasonably dangerous due to its defective and negligent makeup, and in failing to warn of and to discover possible defects or dangerous propensities of the product. She further alleged that the distributor was negligent and breached an implied warranty of merchantability. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment, and on appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. It held that as against the manufacturer, the employee failed to forecast evidence of a defect in the product in existence at the time that it left the plant and held further that she was disqualified by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 99B-2(b) from being a claimant on an implied warranty theory. The court further held that because any defect in the product was latent, the distributor could be liable only for injuries caused by known dangers, and that the defense under &sect; 99B-2(b) was also available to the distributor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants filed a complaint to contest the constitutionality of the county's method of sales and use tax revenue distribution. The trial court granted appellees' motion to dismiss pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Upon review, the court affirmed the decision. The court rejected appellants' argument that the per capita method of distribution denied them the equal protection of the laws because it arbitrarily distinguished between residents that resided in the county for more than six months and those who do not. The court held that because N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-472 did not affect a suspect class and did not impinge on a fundamental right, it properly survived the rational basis test under the Equal Protection Clause. The court held that the statute did not treat nonresidents any differently than it treats state residents. The court also concluded that neither the statute in no way interfered with free migration into the state nor did it deny appellants of any of the privileges and immunities guaranteed by the federal and state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The general assembly, through N.C. Local Act ch. 818, required the city to adopt a statutory plan for providing municipal services. The owners filed an action against the city, claiming that ch. 818 was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the action. The court held that the trial court did not err in dismissing the owners' claim that ch. 818 violated N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 24. N.C. Local Act ch. 818 was constitutional even though N.C. Local Act ch. 818, &sect; 3 was void and unenforceable. Section 3 required the city to extend municipal services in a manner that was not authorized except when annexation was accomplished under general law. Thus, the general assembly passed a local act relating to health and sanitation in contravention of N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 24(a). However, N.C. Local Act ch. 818, &sect; 3 was severable from the remainder of ch. 818. The trial court erred in dismissing the owner's claim that the annexation was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the equal protection clause. When an equal protection claim was made, a less heightened, lower tier avenue of review was available.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of some of the owners' claims. The court reversed the dismissal of the owners' equal protection claim and remanded the case for the lower tier evaluation.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's order. The court stated that the definition of mental illness in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 122C-3(21)(ii) was clearly susceptible to different interpretations and arbitrary applications. The excessive use of the conjunction &quot;or&quot; compounded the uncertainty inherent in the statute, and the terms &quot;age appropriate&quot; and &quot;age adequate&quot; were subject to varying explanations. The statute failed to prescribe an ascertainable standard to enable judges to interpret it and administer it uniformly. The definition of mental illness as applied to an adult differed from the definition of mental illness as applied to a minor. And, the trial court properly applied the adult standard for involuntary commitment after finding N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 122C-3(21)(ii) void for vagueness. The evidence supported the trial court's findings of fact.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that there was no basis for defendant's assertions that her prosecution without the finding of criminal intent was unconstitutional because the United States Supreme Court had not decided that due process of law required a finding of criminal intent to support a conviction for a non-petty offense. The court also held that defendant's breach of a motor statute was a sufficient finding of negligence to support her conviction. Finally, the court held that the superior court had failed to consider defendant's resources in making the restitution order and had incorrectly applied N.C. Gen.

On review, the court affirmed. The court held that the sale of any obscene item constituted a separate offense, regardless of whether defendants disseminated several items during each sales transaction. The clear legislative intent of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-190.1(a) was to consider the dissemination of each item listed within the statute as a separate unlawful act. The court held that defendants' double jeopardy rights were also not violated. Defendants were not convicted with violating two or more statutes with one transaction, but rather of multiple violations of one statute.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-141.4(a2) for unintentionally causing the death of another person while engaged in the violation of any state law or local ordinance applying to the operation or use of a vehicle.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The basis of the charge against defendant was an alleged violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-141(m), alleging that defendant failed to decrease his speed as was necessary to avoid colliding with any person, vehicle or other conveyance. Defendant claimed that a literal application of &sect; 20-141(m) subjected a motorist to prosecution in almost any collision in which he was involved, whether or not he was at fault. Defendant argued that the legislature obviously did not intend that result, so the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court reversed, holding that the standard by which persons were adjudged liable under &sect; 20-141(m) was that a motorist must reduce speed as may be necessary to avoid a collision. Defendant's literal interpretation of &sect; 20-141(m) was erroneous because, where possible, courts construed statutes to avoid serious doubts about their constitutionality. Accordingly, the court held that &sect; 20-141(m) was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed. The trial court's instructions to the jury on the three-part definition of obscenity simply parroted the language of the statute, and thus failed to inform the jury that contemporary community standards established the measure by which &quot;patent offensiveness&quot; must be judged, that the literary, artistic, political, or scientific value of each work had to be decided with reference to the work &quot;taken as a whole,&quot; and that a reasonable person standard was the measure by which such value had to be assessed. The error was not harmless because in an obscenity trial, the manner in which the jury was instructed to evaluate whether a work was obscene was of fundamental importance. It was not error to exclude magazines that were involved in obscenity trials ending in acquittal because three of the magazines involved prosecutions in another county, and there was no evidence in the fourth case that the acquittal was based on a finding that the material was not obscene.</SPAN></P>

The plan did not amount to an unlawful confiscation or a penalty and did not violate due process or equal protection. It was a valid regulatory exercise of the commission's authority over intrastate telecommunications. The court held that the interim plan was lawful as applied to resellers, including the provision directing local carriers to file tariffs, because it was authorized under N.C. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After plaintiffs retired, the state legislature modified the pension plan for local government employees.

The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment, finding that the changes in the disability retirement requirements challenged by plaintiffs were made primarily to correct inequities in the plan. Finding that the relationship between the parties was one of contract, the court reversed and remanded by holding that defendants' explanation did not demonstrate that the legislative changes were reasonable and necessary to serve an important state interest.

The court concluded that no rational juror could have found value in the materials at issue and that the testimony by defendant's expert witnesses did not establish that the materials had scientific or educational value. The court found that it was appropriate for the jury to apply the standards of their community in the absence of any definition of &quot;community&quot; in N. C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-190.1. The court ruled that it was not an abuse of discretion to deny defendant's motion for mistrial after the police officer testified that the materials were obscene.

The court on appeal further affirmed the trial court's decision and denied defendant's challenges to various aspects of the trial court's jury instructions, concluding that (1) the trial court properly explained that patent offensiveness must be judged by community standards and adequately informed the jury that they were not to apply their own personal standards, but rather those of the average adult in the community; (2) the trial court, through repetition, had effectively removed the danger that the jury might judge the alleged offensiveness of the materials in question with reference to young people; (3) the trial court's use of an erroneous jury instruction regarding the question of an allegedly obscene work's value was harmless error; and (4) &sect; 14-190.1 required proof that defendant knew the nature and content of the materials he purveyed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the trial court erred in its apparent conclusion that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 74C-17(c) (1983)), the provision authorizing civil penalties, violated N.C. Const. art. IV, &sect; 3. The court noted that all administrative civil penalties were not per se in violation of the state constitution and that, under Art. IV, &sect; 3, the granting of the judicial power to assess a civil penalty had to be &quot;reasonably necessary&quot; to the purposes for which an agency was created and with appropriate guidelines for the exercise of the discretion. The court found that &sect; 74C-17(c), the provision authorizing civil penalties, was reasonably necessary to the Board in fulfilling its duties. The court also found, after reviewing the Board's decision under the other five standards set out in &sect; 150A-51 (1983), that the Board's decision should be affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of three counts of armed robbery under three separate indictments which alleged 1) theft of currency from an appliance store in the presence of two salesmen; 2) theft of currency from one of the salesmen; and 3) theft of a wallet, currency, and credit cards from the other salesmen. The court arrested one judgment, but affirmed the other two. The court held that: 1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of a similar robbery with which defendant had been charged, but not convicted, because conviction was not a prerequisite to admissibility under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 404(b), and the question of defendant's identity was sufficiently indefinite to permit evidence of the earlier robbery; 2) the photographic lineup was not impermissibly suggestive merely because defendant's appearance was somehow distinct from the other suspects' photographs; 3) only two assaults (of the two employees) occurred, so although money was taken from three separate sources, one judgment was arrested; and 4) the imposition of consecutive minimum sentences did not violate the proscriptions of the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order of the Superior Court, Cleveland County (North Carolina), which convicted him of disseminating obscenity in violation of N.C.

He contended that the conviction was constitutionally invalid because the jury had not been required to apply a statewide contemporary standard in determining whether the materials were obscene and the trial court committed numerous other errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his convictions on several grounds. On appeal, the court affirmed because he received a fair trial, free of prejudicial error. The statute was constitutional because the use of national standards to determine whether material was obscene was not constitutionally required. States could define an obscenity offense in terms of contemporary community standards. When the statute did not define community, the trial court properly declined to restrict or expand that term in its jury instructions. The possibility that the use of community standards might cause material to be considered obscene in some parts of the state but not others did not violate N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The trial court properly excluded testimony of defendant's expert witnesses as the evidence had no relevance to what the community considered obscene. Evidence that similar materials were available was also not relevant to whether the materials at issue were obscene. Defendant's guilty knowledge was shown by evidence that he told undercover police that the materials were illegal. The jury instructions sufficiently stated the law with respect to defendant's intent and guilty knowledge.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>

IX, &sect; 2(1) by the legislature's method of financing the operation of state public schools and by operation of five separate administrative school units in a particular county. As a consequence, the students argued, the present system was constitutionally impermissible because it required the state to provide flat rate grants to local school administrative units based solely on the average number of pupils attending school. Affirming the trial court dismissal of the students' complaint, the court found that the framers of the state constitution did not intend to alter the method of financing state public schools, but rather meant to reflect and preserve that method. Further, the court reasoned, the fundamental right enumerated in the constitution was the right to equal access to public schools, that being every child's fundamental right to receive a general and uniform education in the state's public schools; however, the constitution did not require the provision of identical opportunities to each student.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The shop owner challenged ch. 127B, which regulated businesses that bought and sold military surplus property. The state argued that the regulation was necessary to prevent stores from serving as &quot;fences&quot; for stolen military property and challenged the sufficiency and correctness of the trial court's ruling. The court affirmed, finding that although the trial court's order did not explicitly state that the regulation was unconstitutional or the grounds for its judgment, it clearly declared the rights of the parties and effectively disposed of the dispute. The injunctive order, which failed to state the reasons for its issuance, was irregular and not void and could be corrected by the trial court. The regulation was unconstitutional because it exceeded the state's police powers, pursuant to N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The court found no distinguishing feature in the shop owner's business the natural and probable consequence of which, if unregulated, was to produce substantial injury to the public peace, health, or welfare. The state could not attempt by regulation to rid ordinary callings of the dishonest or enlist the aid of private businesses in enforcing criminal laws.</SPAN></P>

One of the patients, a 30-year old mentally retarded woman, accused defendant of rape. The state indicted defendant for rape. The trial court convicted defendant and the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court properly admitted testimony by doctors who stated that the victim exhibited behavioral characteristic consistent with sexual abuse and that she was able to distinguish reality from fantasy. The court held that the doctors' opinions were based upon experience in treating sexually abused mentally retarded persons, familiarity with research and literature in that field, and personal examination of the victim. Further, the court held that the testimony of witnesses who claimed that they were also sexually abused by defendant tended to prove a continuing and ongoing course of sexual molestation by defendant of mentally retarded young women employed under his supervision, and a common plan or scheme to take sexual advantage of his relationship of authority over these women. Thus, the evidence was admissible under N.C. R. Evid. 404(b).</SPAN></P>

The Tax Review Board affirmed this decision. The court affirmed holding that (1) the secretary's decision was arbitrary and capricious, (2) the interpretation of the law as set out by the secretary had the effect of making the taxpayer's tax liability the same as it would have been had the state included income it did not have the power to tax, and (3) the secretary's interpretation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 105-147(9)d 2 and 3 resulted in the indirect taxation of taxpayer's Alabama income in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and North Carolina's law of the land clause and exceeded statutory authority as espoused in the statute's general purpose clause.</SPAN></P>

The indictments, which quoted the operative language of the statute, were sufficient as they clearly informed defendant of the conduct that was the subject of the accusations, as required by &sect; 15A-924(a)(5). A witness's testimony was property admitted because it strengthened the victim's testimony and was corroborative. The trial court did not err in refusing to compel a witness to testify after he had invoked the self-incrimination privilege, and the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest, N.C. R.

Defendant claimed that the trial court had committed prejudicial error in admonishing a witness, out of the presence of the jury but in the presence of other witnesses, that she could be subject to perjury and contempt of court because of her testimony. The court did not find anything in the colloquy that suggested the trial judge's statements were accusatory and threatening, that the district attorney's admonitions were reversibly prejudicial, or that any action of the trial judge or district attorney caused the witnesses to violate their oaths to tell the truth. Next, the court did not find any violations of defendant's rights to a speedy trial, as provided in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-701 et seq. (1983). However, the court found the evidence, implicating defendant in other killings, was inadmissible under N.C. R. Evid. 404(b).

After the effective date of the amendment of &sect; 143-166(y), the retiree requested and received disability retirement. He received disability payments from the Fund and earned money from other sources. The Fund demanded that the retiree return some of the money he received from the Fund.

The trial court granted defendants' motions. On appeal, the court reversed. The court concluded that first defendant, by making a general appearance, waived any objections based on personal jurisdiction, sufficiency of process, service of process, and sufficiency of the complaint to state a claim, so his motions to dismiss on those grounds should have been denied. The court held that although a summons was addressed to the commissioner of motor vehicles as second defendant's agent, there was no possibility of confusion, and that service of process by certified rather than registered mail sufficiently complied with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-105(2) to confer jurisdiction. The court also determined that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-105 was constitutional as applied to second defendant, a nonresident motorist, the requirement for mailing a copy of the process to the last known address met due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Many video and movie businesses challenged the constitutionality of statutory amendments aimed at preventing child pornography and obscenity. The court found that the state had a compelling interest in the protection of society as a willing or unwilling audience from the corrupting effects of obscenity. The state additionally had an interest of surpassing importance in the protection of minors from the physiological and psychological injuries resulting from sexual exploitation and abuse. Accordingly, the court upheld the trial court's judgment that the statutes were permissible under the North Carolina Constitution and the United States Constitution. The court did not find that the statutes were overbroad on their face. Nor was N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-190.1(a)(3) substantially overbroad in its coverage.

The court held that while in general, legislation was presumed constitutional and the burden was upon the complaining party to show its invalidity, it found that the corporation had met its burden by presenting evidence which clearly demonstrated the facial invalidity of the ordinance. The court further held that even though the ordinance contained a severability clause, all parts of the ordinance were related to the unconstitutional purpose and thus, there were no provisions which could validly be given effect.</SPAN></P>

The organizations sued to declare the statute unconstitutional and obtained orders preliminarily restraining defendants from arresting or prosecuting them. Later, summary judgment was entered dissolving the injunction and dismissing the action. On appeal, the organizations contended, as they did in their complaint, that the statute was too vague to be generally followed or enforced because the words &quot;session&quot; and &quot;sessions&quot; were not defined by the statute and could mean different things. The court affirmed, concluding that in the context of the statute as a whole, the meaning of those words was quite plain to anyone of common understanding and that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The court reasoned that no one had a constitutional right to operate a gambling business and that the statute was reasonably related to the legislative purpose of limited such activity.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the trial court erred by not applying N.C. Gen.

The court held that the town acted within its rights in revoking the certificate of compliance after it subsequently adopted revisions to its zoning ordinance prohibiting projects such as that proposed by the builder and where the builder had not made substantial expenditures in reliance upon the certificate.

After a sentencing hearing at which the trial court found aggravating and mitigating factors, the trial court imposed a sentence greater than the presumptive term for the offenses. The court affirmed the conviction for robbery with a dangerous weapon, but arrested the conviction for felonious larceny and held that the trial court improperly punished defendant for felonious larceny and armed robbery based on a single taking from one person at one time. The court also remanded for resentencing and held that the trial court did not indicate whether the additional years added for aggravating factors was added for the armed robbery or for the felonious larceny conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff firefighters appealed the judgment entered by the Superior Court, Pasquotank County (North Carolina). The firefighters filed the action against defendants, a city and some of its employees (collectively city), for declaratory and other relief for the removal of accumulated vacation leave from their employment records by the city. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city. The firefighters appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city employed the firefighters under oral contracts for indefinite periods. A 1972 ordinance provided for vacation leave accumulation, but the ordinance did not define a &quot;workday.&quot; Nor did the firefighters' handbook define a &quot;workday.&quot; Letters from the city were sent during 1978 and 1979. The letters included a list of accumulated vacation leave, in excess of 360 hours. A 1980 ordinance did define a workday as a 12-hour shift. In 1980, the number of maximum vacation leave days that could be accrued was 30. In 1982, the city adjusted the employment records and removed hours of accumulated vacation leave that were in excess of 360. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the city on all but the breach of contract claim, which was remanded. Just because the 1972 ordinance did not define &quot;workday&quot; did not mean that it was different than 12 hours. However, the city was estopped to assert the invalidity of the supplementary contracts because of the statements that were sent to the firefighters listing the value of the accumulated time. The firefighters' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim failed because they showed no deprivation of any constitutional right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded, in part, the breach of contract claim. The remainder of the summary judgment granted in favor of the city was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The landowner argued that he had sustained and would continue to sustain a diminution in the value of his property due to increased traffic on roads that already carried traffic volumes in excess of capacity and due to increased demands upon already overburdened public utilities. The city filed an answer in which it admitted that the proper procedures for annexation had not been followed. The trial court, without a motion, dismissed the landowner's complaint. The court affirmed, holding that where the adjacent landowner had failed to plead special damages to him distinct from those of the rest of the community, the trial court had to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing. The court reasoned that to have standing, an adjacent or nearby landowner must have alleged and shown special damages distinct from the rest of the community.

Plaintiff, after learning of defendant's material misrepresentations, filed suit against defendant for fraud and unfair business practices.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that there was competent evidence to support the findings that defendant made false representations which plaintiff reasonably relied upon. The court held that plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to support the award of some of its lost profits, but not others. The court held that the court was within its discretion in failing to award plaintiff attorney's fees. The court held that the trial court's failure to award punitive damages was not an abuse of discretion given the substantial amount of treble damages awarded by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The wife sought review. The wife argued that the trial court erred in denying her motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. The wife also argued that the trial court erred in denying her motion for a compulsory reference. The wife argued that she was denied a fair trial by the trial court's statements and questions. The wife further argued that the trial court erred in entering judgment in open court and that it lacked the authority to sign the written judgment. The wife also alleged that the trial court erred in making findings of fact in the judgment that were not supported by the evidence. The court found that the wife's appellate brief violated N.C. R.

The students filed suit, alleging that the ban deprived them of a &quot;fundamental right&quot; to an education and violated the Equal Protection Clause. The trial court granted the board's motion for summary judgment. Affirming the grant of summary judgment, the court held that the ban was a valid exercise of the authority delegated to the boards of education by the legislature. The right to smoke in public places was not a protected right. Further, greater regulation of conduct was permissible in a school environment than otherwise would be allowed. The board had legitimate concerns over students' health; the cleanliness of the property; fire hazards; the use of &quot;smoking areas&quot; for the smoking of illegal, non-tobacco cigarettes; and the effect of smoke inhaled from the air on non-smokers. These concerns were all reasonably related to the educational process and thus provided a rational basis for the regulation. The students were not denied equal protection because the primary justification of the ban, preventing adolescents from becoming addicted to tobacco products, did not apply to the teachers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that the superior court's inquiry as to the numerical division of the jury was coercive and violative of defendant's right to trial by jury.

The court found the results of the analysis of defendant's blood was needed for evidence, and ordered the treating hospital to furnish the reports of all tests and treatment of defendant. Defendant challenged this order on the ground that the information was irrelevant and constituted inadmissible hearsay, and that the results of the blood test were inadmissible for lack of authentication. The court affirmed, and found that the trial court's order constituted substantial compliance with the statute&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-53. Defendant maintained that reversible error occurred because defendant was not given notice of the hearing of the motion to compel disclosure and was not present when the motion was heard. Defendant's challenge was without merit for two reasons. One, defendant could have appealed the order. An appeal would lie from an order to compel disclosure of medical testimony and reports.

A relevant inquiry was whether a defendant engaged in some act or conduct by which he might be said to have invoked the benefits and protections of the law of the forum. The court affirmed and held that the participation in the drafting of a North Carolina partnership agreement and the supervision of the closing of a transaction by the partnership within the State of North Carolina was conduct in the state that invoked the protection of the law of the state to such an extent that traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice were not offended by requiring defendants to defend in the state an action growing out of the partnership.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 113-156.1 created an unconstitutional classification by requiring a license for commercial fishing piers on the ocean but not in other areas. The court held that &sect; 113-156.1 satisfied the requirements of uniformity, equal protection, and due process under both the state and federal constitutions. The court found that &sect; 113-156.1 applied equally to every manager of an ocean fishing pier within the coastal fishing waters who charged the public a fee to fish in any manner from the pier. Given that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 113-185(a) afforded the operators of such piers the opportunity to establish an exclusive recreational fishing zone, the court held that it was a wholly reasonable classification to require a license for managers of ocean piers only. Further, the court held that &sect; 113-156.1 did not violate N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 5, as it was evident that the license tax was levied and applied for the special purpose of the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff alleged in its complaint that the corporation acted at all pertinent times in its behalf, and that the corporation had, in plaintiff's behalf, presented the initial demand for payment. The salesman arranged tire sales through the corporation, for which the corporation received compensation and for which the corporation in turn compensated the salesman. The salesman by his efforts conferred a business benefit on the corporation and was paid accordingly as part of an ongoing contractual arrangement. It was undisputed that the salesman placed orders with the corporation on behalf of North Carolina tire dealers over a period of at least six months. The salesman alleged, and the corporation did not deny, that the corporation did continuous substantial business through other dealers in North Carolina. The fact that the corporation received orders in West Virginia and never physically operated in North Carolina did not mean it did not have business contacts in the state. The dependent nature of the salesman's claim against the corporation could mean that the entire matter would be relitigated from the beginning if the court declined jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff wife appealed from the Superior Court, Nash County (North Carolina), which entered judgment in favor of defendant husband and ruled that the &quot;equal right to control&quot; provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 39-13.6(a) did not apply to pre-1983 tenancies by the entirety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A husband sought to exercise exclusive control over a pre-1983 tenancy by the entirety that he held with his wife. The wife maintained, however, that the &quot;equal right to control&quot; provisions of &sect; 39-13.6(a) should be construed to apply to pre-1983 tenancies by the entirety. Upon consideration, the trial court ruled in favor of the husband. On appeal, the court held that the legislature clearly intended that the &quot;equal right to control&quot; provisions would apply retroactively. Moreover, the court determined that retroactive application of the provisions would not unconstitutionally interfere with a vested right of the husband, but rather, would be in accord with the constitutional guarantee of equal protection on the basis of gender. Finally, based on its decision that &sect; 39-13.6(a) should apply retroactively, the court concluded that the wife was entitled to recovery of an equal share of the income produced by the property that she owned with her husband after the effective date of &sect; 39-13.6(a), and prospectively, to an equal right to use and control of the property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ruled in favor of the wife, held that the state's &quot;equal right to control&quot; provisions applied retroactively to pre-1983 tenancies by the entirety, and thus, reversed the judgment in favor of the husband and granted the relief requested by the wife.</SPAN></P>

Defendants contended that the affidavit does not contain any information from which anyone could reasonably relate the dwelling to be searched to the field of marijuana. The court disagreed and found that the magistrate could have concluded that there was a fair probability that a house near a marijuana field in a rural county was related to the field. The court held that the trial court did not err in finding the application was sufficient for the magistrate to find there was a fair probability that marijuana was in the house. Defendants contended that the trial court committed reversible error by failing make findings of fact before denying their second motion to suppress.

He appealed the conviction on the basis that evidence was improperly admitted at trial and on the basis that the state's evidence was insufficient to have convicted him of the crime charged. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the trial court's failure to make a formal ruling on the motion to suppress had not rendered the ruling null and void. The court said that the failure to formally rule did not normally rise to the level of reversible error. The court also said that the trial court's intention to deny the motion was clear from the record. The court held that the state's evidence was sufficient to have convicted defendant of the crime charged. The court found that touching of the child was not required to complete the offense and that defendant's conduct, which included exposing and touching his penis in front of the child, fell within the purview of the statute. The court found that defendant not only approached the child, but repeatedly announced his desire to engage in sexual activity. This constituted sexual conduct, the court said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowners filed an inverse condemnation action against appellee city and alleged that takings occurred when a new airport runway opened and the airport's usage substantially increased.

The court said that because appellants had filed their action more than two years after the runway opened, their claim was time-barred. The court noted that the six-month grace period permitted by the statute for claims that had arisen before its enactment did not save appellants' claim because they had had more than two years after enactment to have filed the lawsuit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant stole a new van from an automobile dealership and, when chased by police, totaled the vehicle.

Stat. &sect; 15A-1343, the trial court ordered defendant to pay restitution to an insurance company for payments it made to the dealership. The trial court held that the provision of N.C. Gen.

On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court. The court concluded that the classification between victims of crime, who were forced to deal with its consequences, and third party indemnitors, who contracted for the liability, was rational and served a legitimate state purpose. The court held that the statute was designed to rehabilitate offenders and compensate the victims of crime, both of which were legitimate state purposes.

Defendants counterclaimed for unfair trade practices and breach of fiduciary duty under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 75-1.1 and 75-16. The trial court granted plaintiff's motion to dismiss the counterclaims under N.C. R. Civ. P. 12 because the last act leading to the suit occurred in Virginia, so North Carolina law did not apply to the case. Virginia had no unfair trade practices act comparable to &sect; 75-1.1, so defendants' claim failed. The trial court had also held that &sect; 75-1.1 was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed dismissal of the counterclaims, but modified the trial court's order. It explained that under N.C. R. Civ. P. 12, a court was not required to make findings of fact or conclusions of law in a judgment on the pleadings because the facts of the case were those alleged in the pleadings. As a result, the trial court's determination that &sect; 75-1.1 was unconstitutional had no legal effect. The court disregarded trial court's findings and struck them from the record.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendants' motion to dismiss the individuals from the action, held that the portion of the act that violated the state constitution could be severed, and ordered compliance with the remainder of the statute. On appeal, the court affirmed the portion of the trial court's ruling that found the statute unconstitutional, holding that: 1) the town had standing to challenge the statute; 2) the statute was a local act; 3) the statute discontinued a street as the public was deprived of its use; therefore, 4) the statute was unconstitutional. The court reversed the portion of the trial court judgment that severed only the unconstitutional portion of the statute, holding that because the parts of the statute were interrelated and mutually dependant, the fact that one part was unconstitutional meant that the whole statute failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On October 1, 1971, new provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act went into effect which allowed compensation for occupational hearing loss. Shortly after the provisions went into effect, the employer issued hearing protective devices and began a program of regular testing. Thereafter, the employee filed a claim seeking workers' compensation for his hearing loss. In denying compensation, the Commission held that &sect; 97-53(28) allowed no compensation for hearing loss existing prior to October 1, 1971 and that the ear protection equipment reduced the noise level in the employee's ears below 90db. Upon review, the court held that the 90db limit in &sect; 97-53(28) was the ambient noise level and that the noise level in the employee's ear could not be relied upon. The court also rejected the contention that under &sect; 97-53(28)i, the providing of protective devices established any absolute bar to claims for hearing loss. Finally, the court held that nothing in 1971 N.C. Sess. Laws 1108, &sect; 3 or N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-53(28) expressly mandated that hearing loss existing prior to October 1, 1971 was not compensable, as long as the last injurious exposure occurred after that date.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. 90-18 in the Superior Court, Cumberland County (North Carolina), arguing that the statute was unconstitutional, the trial court erroneously admitted the decedent's written statement, gave erroneous jury instructions, and the evidence was insufficient to withstand the practitioners' motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The practitioners treated the decedent, suffering from pancreatic cancer, with salves and vitamins, but, as a result, he was treated for chemical burns before death. The practitioners were charged, and they moved for dismissal unsuccessfully. Found guilty of practicing medicine without a license, they appealed. The court, finding the statute constitutional, declined to find discriminatory selective prosecution where merchants selling nonprescription medicines, herbal remedies, and books about diets to cure cancer were not within the same class as the practitioners. Thus, they failed to show that they were singled out or prosecuted in bad faith. The court refused to recognize a fundamental right of the terminally ill to choose unorthodox medical treatment or to protect anyone willing to provide it. As to evidence admitted, the court held that as declarant decedent was unavailable, his written statement concerning material facts was more probative than other available evidence, and its admission best served justice. Where lack of criminal intent was not a valid defense, the court had no duty to instruct the jury on intent. In affirming, the court found the evidence was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

As for defendant's speedy trial argument, he failed to show that the delay was unreasonable, that it was the result of the State's negligence, or that it was prejudicial to his defense. The court found no error in granting a continuance to the State because two witnesses were unavailable. It was also not error for the trial court to not instruct on a lesser included offense where there was no evidence that defendant acted in the heat of passion on sudden provocation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for taking indecent liberties with children, in violation of &sect; 14-202.1(a)(1). Defendant had exposed certain boys to lewd activity and invited them to imitate the activity. Defendant claimed that &sect; 14-202.1(a)(1) was unconstitutionally vague and that the evidence was insufficient to warrant a conviction. Specifically, he claimed that the word &quot;with,&quot; as used in &sect; 14-202.1(a)(1) required him to be in close proximity or near the children. Thus, defendant claimed that he was too far away from the children to be with them for the purpose of taking an indecent liberty. On appeal, the court, inter alia, rejected defendant's contention that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. Also, the court noted that physical touching was not necessary in an indecent liberty prosecution and refused to hold that a defendant had to be within a certain distance of or in close proximity to a child victim. In overruling defendant's contention that the evidence was insufficient, the court noted that defendant was about the same distance from the boys that home plate was from a pitcher's mound on a baseball diamond and that he was close enough for the boys to hear his invitation.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the summary judgment granted to the state. The court held that the bailment surcharge was not a tax, and that the board's contract was not impaired. The court held that the surcharge was not a tax because &sect; 133 of Chapter 761 imposed upon liquor only the cost of regulation. The court held that enforcement of the alcoholic beverage control laws was part of the cost of regulating liquor traffic and all local boards were required to pay for liquor law enforcement out of the profits of the local alcohol beverage control system pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18B-805. The court held that the expenditure of revenues generated from the bailment surcharge to operate a division had a direct and reasonable relationship to enforcement of alcoholic beverage control laws because the need for the law enforcement arose out of the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages, including distilled liquors and fortified wine. The court held that the bailment surcharge was not unconstitutional as an inequitable tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The power company objected to the admission of evidence at trial that had not been produced during discovery to rulings regarding the testimony of both parties' experts, and to the trial court's denial of the power company's motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict, arguing that so many improper rulings had been made that it had been deprived of a fair trial. The court agreed with the power company that prejudgment interest should not have been awarded on the portion of the judgment subject to an insurance deductible because N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 24-5 applied only to judgments covered by liability insurance. The court agreed with the homeowners that the trial court should not have reduced the verdict because it was supported by the evidence and the homeowners had not agreed to a remittitur. Otherwise, the court found no error in the trial, holding that 1) the admission of the evidence was within the judge's discretion; 2) any errors regarding the rulings on testimony by experts were harmless because of other, substantially similar information admitted at other times; and 3) other rulings were rendered harmless by appropriate comments by the trial judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted and punished at &quot;Level Two&quot; under the Act. Defendant appealed, claiming that the means of sentencing permitted by the Act deprived him of his right to a jury trial because the Act allowed for enhanced sentences when the sentencing judge found aggravating factors which were no more than offenses or elements of offenses which typically would be put before a jury. The court agreed that defendant pointed out how the Act could possibly deny an accused his right to a trial if a sentencing judge convicted the accused of an aggravating factor and used the new conviction to enhance the accused's sentence. However, the court stated that defendant failed to show how he himself was injured by the Act. The record did not show which aggravating factor harmed defendant. The only factor present in the record was that defendant had a prior conviction for the same offense which, the court noted, could not be construed as denying him the right to a jury trial. The court stated that defendant had no standing to challenge the parts of the Act that turned separate offenses into aggravating factors as the record did not show that defendant was convicted of any of those offenses.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the sentence. He argued that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-179(c) was unconstitutional because the serious injury to another person was an element of the crime that had to be determined by the jury. The court affirmed the sentence because the serious injury to another person was a sentencing factor to be considered by the judge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant banking entities challenged a ruling of appellee, the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks, dismissing one appellant's application to acquire and operate the other as an industrial bank, claiming that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-229, on which the Commissioner relied in dismissing the application, violated the Commerce, Contract, and Ex Post Facto Clauses of the United States Constitution as well as N.C. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 19, 32, and 34.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants agreed that one of them, a bank, would purchase the other, an industrial bank, and operate it in North Carolina. After agreeing to the acquisition, appellant bank sought the Commissioner's approval of the transaction. When the Commissioner denied approval based on N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-229, both parties to the contract appealed. The court affirmed. Noting that the question of the constitutionality of &sect; 53-229 in the face of a federal and state Commerce Clause challenge had already been settled in favor of the statute, the court found no merit to appellants' claim that &sect; 53-229 was void as an impairment of contract because it nullified the parties' acquisition agreement. In so ruling, the court held that although the Contracts Clause limited the State's power to amend or abolish obligations of contract, it did not strip the States of its police power to protect the general welfare of the people, and that &sect; 53-229 was a legitimate exercise of the State's power to adopt a law in a field, banking, in which the legislature was entitled to act to protect the public. That it had the incidental effect of nullifying a private contract did not render it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

He claimed that the board failed to comply with the requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115C-325(d)(2) (Cum. Supp. 1981) in demoting him. The board argued that the teacher had not been designated as a career teacher before serving for three years as a supervisor and that, therefore, the statute did not protect him. In affirming the judgment in favor of the teacher, the court held that a 1983 amendment to the statute showed that the legislature intended to protect persons who had served as supervisors for at least three consecutive years regardless of whether this time was served prior to obtaining career teacher status. Therefore, the teacher was entitled to the procedural safeguards of the Teacher Tenure Act before being demoted from his supervisory position. The teacher had agreed to waive his claim for reinstatement but was entitled to a salary adjustment to compensate him for any loss of salary and benefits because of the improper demotion.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the standard in the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because a drinking driver did not know precisely when he had reached that level. The court ruled that the State introduced sufficient evidence to lay a foundation for the admissibility of the breathalyzer. The court granted defendant a new trial. The court held that the trial court committed prejudicial error by permitting the State to question defendant regarding his failure to testify in the district court trial. The State's impeachment method adversely implicated defendant's right not to testify in district court as well as his right to counsel. Further, it violated both the law and spirit of N.C. Gen.

There was evidence to support the commission's finding that the corporation was a &quot;lessee or user&quot; of forest within the purview of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-282.7. Taxing the leasehold interests in exempted real property was allowed pursuant to &sect; 105-273(8). Section 105-282.7 permissibly allowed the corporation to be taxed as if it owned the forest because the corporation was conducting a business for profit. Section 105-282.7 was not constitutional because it applied to all users of forestlands owned by the United States, the state, a county, or a municipal corporation that were used in connection with a business conducted for profit.

Stat. &sect; 115C-325(d)(1), which authorized the dismissal of a career teacher for &quot;inadequate performance,&quot; was unconstitutionally void for vagueness was likewise overruled. The evidence clearly showed that the teacher was aware that her job as a schoolteacher entailed maintaining good order and discipline in the classroom and that her alleged failure to maintain good classroom order on numerous, specific occasions was the basis for the steps taken to dismiss her. The teacher's final contention, that in view of the whole record there was no substantial evidence to support her dismissal for inadequate performance of her job, was likewise without merit and was overruled.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court, Lincoln County (North Carolina), which convicted him of driving while impaired in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-138.1. He argued that a horse was not a &quot;vehicle&quot; and he was not &quot;driving&quot; it within the meaning of the statute. He alleged error in the trial court's refusal to dismiss the charge on constitutional grounds and to exclude the testimony of the breathalyzer operator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence revealed that defendant was riding a horse on a street while defendant had an alcohol concentration of 0.18. The court upheld the trial court's judgment. First, the court held that a horse was a vehicle for the purpose of charging a violation of &sect; 20-138.1. On this issue of first impression, the court looked to other jurisdictions and noted the broad definition of vehicles in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-4.01(49) in determining the legislative intent. The court then found the evidence sufficient to support the jury verdict. The court rejected defendant's claim that &sect; 20-138.1 violated defendant's constitutional rights by failing to provide for the right to counsel at a critical stage of the prosecution. The administration of the chemical analysis not a critical stage of the prosecution entitling him to counsel. Moreover, the requirement of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-139.1(b3) that defendant be given two breathalyzer tests did not create an impermissible classification denying him equal protection of the laws. Finally, it was not an impermissible shifting of the burden of proof to require defendant to prove his affirmative defense that the breathalyzer was not properly maintained.</SPAN></P>

In so ruling, the court rejected defendants' argument that &sect; 14-223, which prohibited the willful resistance or obstruction of a police officer in the discharge of his duties, was unconstitutionally vague. The court explained that &sect; 14-223 passed constitutional muster because it was not so generally phrased that it proscribed innocent and orderly communication with police officers. The court also rejected defendants' argument that &sect; 14-223 had the effect of chilling legitimate communications between individuals and police officers. The court noted that &sect; 14-223 clearly would not have the effect of chilling communications intended to assert rights, clarify misunderstandings, or gain information in a peaceable and orderly manner. The court further ruled that the superior court did not commit reversible error by failing to strike an officer's testimony that the officers had information in reference to serving the warrant that one defendant might run. The court explained that the admission was not error because the testimony was not offered for its truth, but rather to explain the officer's actions.</SPAN></P>

The commission disagreed and denied the claim for a property tax exemption. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the imposition of a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax on the company's imported tobacco located in customs bonded warehouses was not prohibited by the Import-Export Clause of the United States Constitution. Further, even though the imported tobacco involved in the action was held in customs bonded warehouses, the import-export clause conferred no immunity to it from nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes. The state property taxation of the tobacco was not preempted by federal regulation. Also, because the taxation was not a discriminatory burden on commerce, it was not prohibited by the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The record that the Board certified to the court was quite incomplete. It contained only selected parts of the zoning ordinance the landowner was allegedly violating and no part of the earlier ordinance that was in effect when the house involved was built, or at least when the City gave the former owner a permit to build it. The record showed that the house was built under a permit issued by the City, whereas the zoning ordinance the landowner was charged with violating was not enacted until several months after the permit was issued. The former owner was authorized to construct an &quot;accessory building,&quot; but what an &quot;accessory building&quot; under the former ordinance was and what use it was limited to the court did not know. Thus if the house when it was built or started could be lawfully occupied by the owner's child and his family, and nothing in the record suggested that it could not, the limitation later enacted had no application. In all events the court could not conclude from the record that the landowner was in violation of the City zoning ordinance by permitting her son and his family to occupy the dwelling house involved, and therefore vacated the judgment appealed from.</SPAN></P>

The court held that this was not a medical malpractice case and N.C. Gen.

Section 122-24 was intended to create a qualified immunity for those state employees it protected, extending only to their ordinary negligent acts. It did not protect a tortfeasor from personal liability for gross negligence and intentional torts.

Stat. &sect; 50-20(b)(1) (1981 Cum. Supp.), which was in effect when the action was pending. Also, &sect; 50-20(k) did not give the wife any vested rights in any particular marital property. The court remanded to the trial court for a new trial. At the new trial, the trial court was entitled to utilize statutory punishment provisions if the husband obstructed the resolution of the action as he did in the original trial by failing to cooperate with court orders or to participate in the trial.</SPAN></P>

The court noted, however, that the award of prejudgment interest could only apply to compensatory damages and that pre-judgment interest in punitive damages had not been authorized.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporations contributed money to a special fund which allowed them to build a restaurant larger than generally allowed. The corporations challenged the validity of the Town's ordinance requiring a certain number of off-street parking spots for the corporations' restaurant. The trial court granted summary judgment against the corporations. On appeal, the court affirmed. Because the corporations accepted the benefits afforded by the Town's rules in allowing them to build the restaurant that would otherwise be illegally large, the corporations were estopped from denying the validity of the Town's parking requirements. Further, due process did not require the Town to spend the corporations' fund contributions to build parking spaces for the corporations' restaurants; instead, spending the fund was a legislative decision. Finally, the Town did not illegally discriminate in exempting churches from the parking requirements. The exemption was reasonable because church traffic occurred on Sundays when most businesses were closed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs contended that N.C. Gen.

Plaintiffs also contended that Chapter 1248 amounted to the repeal of a general taxing act by local legislation, which violated N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 24(2). The court determined that N.C. Gen.

The court examined the historical and theoretical bases of the actions.

The husband was injured while operating the truck on June 16, 1980. Plaintiffs' action was commenced on July 2, 1981. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-50(6) provided that no action for personal injuries that arose from an alleged defect of a product could be brought more than six years after the date of initial purchase of the product. Plaintiffs did not argue that this statute of repose was applicable to their case. Rather, they argued that the statute was unconstitutional and that their forecast of evidence contained matter that would estop the manufacturer from asserting the statute as a defense. The court disagreed and held that plaintiffs' constitutional arguments did not provide a basis for reversal. It was undisputed that the husband's injuries were sustained more than six years after the initial sale of the lift truck. Therefore, the action was not cognizable and the doctrine of estoppel did not apply. Even if the doctrine of estoppel did apply, the court found that the forecast of evidence did not raise an estoppel issue against the manufacturer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff administratrix filed a negligence action against defendant doctor in the Forsyth County Superior Court (North Carolina). The trial court granted the doctor's motion to dismiss pursuant to N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) on the ground that the action was not brought within the time allotted by statute. The administratrix appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complaint was filed on April 19, 1983. It alleged that the doctor administered radiotherapeutic treatment to the deceased from January 14, 1966 until March 15, 1966 and that the deceased died on March 10, 1981. The administratrix alleged that the deceased died as a result of the doctor's negligence in the administration of this treatment. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-15(c) provided that an action regarding the performance of or failure to perform professional services could not be commenced more than four years from the last act of that gave rise to the cause of action. Additionally, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-53(4) precluded an action for wrongful death if N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-15(c) would have barred the decedent, when alive, from bringing an action for bodily harm. The court held that these statutes precluded the current action and that the trial court properly allowed the motion to dismiss. The court rejected the administratrix' &quot;open courts&quot; arguments under N.C. Const. Art. I, &sect; 18 on the basis that such arguments had already been addressed and decided by the SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA regarding a similar statute of repose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statute of repose applicable to plaintiffs' claims was not the present version of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-50(5), but the version effective from 1963 until 1 October 1981 was 1963 N.C. Sess. Laws 1030. Under the 1963 statute, plaintiffs' negligence claims were barred in 1979. The 1963 statute therefore barred their action nearly two years prior to passage of the 1981 statute of repose, and almost exactly two years before they brought suit. Once the time limit on plaintiffs' cause of action expired, defendants were effectively &quot;cleared&quot; of any wrongdoing or obligation. Plaintiffs' warranty claims against defendants were covered by the statute of repose in that they were essentially actions to recover for damages to real property and arose out of the defective and unsafe condition of the condominium construction. They were barred under the same analysis as above. Under &sect; 1-50(6), since the fireplace was purchased for use during the period 25 January 1973 to 27 September 1973, plaintiffs' claims for damages arising out of a defect were barred at the latest in September 1979.</SPAN></P>

The boundary lines did not follow natural topographic features for about a fourth of their distance. The court concluded the new boundary lines were laid out in compliance and supported by evidence.

Although the residents were prevented from disposing the city manager and examining some documents, the court held that discovery in annexation proceedings was necessarily limited by the nature of the proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner entered into a contract with the general contractor for the construction of an addition.

Thereafter, the property owner filed an action against the contractor and the architectural firm for breach of contract and negligence. The trial court dismissed the owner's claims as untimely filed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the mere affixation of a corporate seal to a document by the contractor did not automatically raise it to the status of an instrument under seal. The court stated that, because the routine use of a corporate seal was merely to demonstrate authority to execute a document, the presence of a corporate seal, without more, did not convert the document into a specialty. The court ruled that the contract contained no recitals or other evidence of the intent to create an instrument under seal. As to the claims against the architectural firm, the court held that N.C.

The court granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of the administratrix on the issue of N. C. Gen.

The sister and the estate of the son appealed. The court determined that the sister was not entitled to wrongful death benefits because, as the son's survivor by three hours, the father was the son's sole beneficiary under the Intestate Succession Act, N. C. Gen. Stat. 29-12(3). Although the sister was the direct beneficiary of the father's estate, that estate was not entitled to wrongful death benefits because public policy did not allow the father to recover for his negligent acts.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 160A-45 to 160A-56. The landowners filed the petition contending that they were mislead by the statutes and that the statutes were unconstitutional. The trial court held that the landowners' interests had not been prejudiced by the statutes, found that they were constitutional, and dismissed the action. The landowners sought review and contended that the statutes were not uniform across the counties in the state. Pursuant to N.C. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 3, the legislature was directed to enact general laws uniformly applicable throughout the state. The court determined that the constitutional provision had not forbidden the legislature to confer power upon municipal corporations. The court found that, in order to establish non-compliance with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-48(e), the landowners were required to show two things: (1) that the boundary of the annexed area failed to follow topographic features; and (2) that it would have been practical for the boundary to follow such features. The court held that the landowners failed to carry their burden. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a divorce action between the ex-husband and his ex-wife, the trial court made a distribution of marital property. The trial court's judgment distributed the property in an unequal manner, without specifically stating that it had found an equal distribution to be inequitable. The judgment did not recite that the trial court had specifically considered all of the factors enumerated in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 50-20(c). Upon review the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that it was valid and binding despite the fact that it did not contain specific recitations. The court found that there was no required statutory form for distributing marital property. The court determined that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 50-20 was not vague, as contended by the ex-husband, and thus it was not unconstitutional. The court held that the property distribution was supported by the findings of fact and appeared to be a fair and reasonable distribution. The court found that the trial court's was sufficiently specific to conclude that the trial court correctly applied the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the Superior Court, Wake County (North Carolina), which denied his motions for dismissal and convicted him of standing bond for a person not a member of his immediate family, and attempting to interfere with a witness by offering to have money paid if the witness did not appear and testify, contending that he made a sufficient showing that he was a victim of unconstitutional selective prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court denied defendant's motions for dismissal and a jury found him guilty of standing bond for a person not a member of his immediate family, and attempting to interfere with a witness. Defendant appealed, contending that he made a sufficient showing that he was a victim of unconstitutional selective prosecution. The court held that the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to dismiss because defendant failed to carry his burden of either showing that he was singled out for prosecution, or that an invidious purpose invaded the state's decision to seek a presentment and indictment against him. In addition, regarding defendant's motion to quash and dismiss the superseding indictment alleging it was obtained as a result of impermissible prosecutorial vindictiveness in violation of U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV, the court held that defendant was not subjected to additional charges or increased punishment. No likelihood of prosecutorial vindictiveness was demonstrated and, therefore, defendant did not show a denial of due process in the bringing of his case to trial. The court concluded that defendant received a fair trial, free from prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that defendant had received a fair trial, free from prejudicial error. Defendant was not a victim of unconstitutional selective prosecution because the state's failure to prosecute others because of a lack of knowledge that they were subject to prosecution for the same offense as defendant did not amount to a denial of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

Upon judicial review, the superior court struck the condition. The board appealed. The court found that the issue of a hygienist's right to own part of a dental practice was not properly before the court. The court determined that the sanction was not arbitrary and capricious because there was a reasonable relationship between the condition imposed and her violation. The court held that the board did not act in an unconstitutional manner in allowing the hygienist to agree to the condition in lieu of an additional 12-month suspension of her license. The superior court's modification was struck and the case was remanded for reinstatement of the board's order.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the best evidence applied only where the contents or terms of the document were controverted.

The court noted that while the record contained a requested instruction, there was nothing in the record to indicate that defendant submitted it in writing and before the charge as required by law. The court concluded that there was no evidence that the jury knew of an habitual felon indictment during the trial on the underlying offense. The court determined that the trial court erred as a matter of state law in sentencing defendant because there was no evidence that he was hired to commit the offense, so the fact of possession or the subsequent sale of the stolen goods could not be considered as an aggravating factor in sentencing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's first trial resulted in a mistrial, which was declared by the trial court over defendant's objection.

Although defendant gave immediate notice of appeal, the trial went forward, but resulted in a mistrial on the motion of defendant. A third trial was conducted, and defendant unsuccessfully renewed a motion to dismiss. Defendant was convicted and appealed on grounds that defendant's motions to dismiss for former jeopardy were improperly denied because the first mistrial was erroneously ordered.

The Commission upheld the decision of the assessment against the taxpayer, and the taxpayer sought review. Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-335, a unit value appraisal was to be made by the Department to determine the true value of the system. The court found that, in determining the true value under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-336(a), the Department was required to consider: (1) the stock and debt approach; (2) the cost approach; (3) the income approach; and (4) any other factor that had a bearing on the true value of the taxpayer's property system. The court found that, although the Department was permitted to exercise its judgment on the appraisal, it was not to be arbitrary and was to be based on substantial evidence. The court determined that the presumption of correctness was with the Department and further found that the taxpayer failed to overcome its burden of proving that the Department's assessment was improper. The court affirmed the decision of the Commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions in one case for conspiracy to assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious bodily injury, conspiracy to commit non-felonious breaking or entering, and non-felonious breaking or entering, and solicitation to commit murder in another case all arose from his hiring of individuals to carry out unlawful acts against others. The court affirmed his convictions and found that his right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI was not violated when the police secretly tape recorded his statements about the proposed murders while he was under indictment for the conspiracy crimes. That activity did not deprive him of his right to counsel because, before the meeting with the police, he had validly waived his right to counsel in connection with his ongoing conspiracy case. The court ruled that the waiver of counsel remained valid until the proceeding was finally terminated and that defendant had not met his burden of showing that he had changed his mind regarding the waiver. Moreover, he could not challenge the admission of the tape recordings into evidence because he did not take exception to the findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the admission.</SPAN></P>

The Forsyth County Superior Court (North Carolina) found in favor of respondents and refused to declare the statute unconstitutional. The citizens appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizens claimed that the statute violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because it prohibited judicial review of the conduct of municipal officials in annexation proceedings alleged to be arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or abusive. They further alleged that the annexation at issue was a violation of the Due Process Clause. The trial court found in favor of respondents and refused to find that the statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the protection afforded by the North Carolina statutes was sufficient to comport with due process. The court noted that the citizens had not alleged that the procedure set out in &sect; 160A-49 was not followed or that the provisions of &sect;&sect; 160A-47 and 160A-48 were not met, as was required by &sect; 160A-50(f). The court concluded that the annexation statutes were not unconstitutionally applied to the citizens.

The judge here merely recommended restitution as a condition of work release or parole, as authorized by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 148-57.1(c). Only if restitution was a &quot;condition imposed&quot; would there be a statutory requirement that the trial judge make findings as to the factors enumerated in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1343(d). The reviewing court also rejected defendant's contention that the judge's recommendation regarding restitution denied him equal protection of the law. Precedent held that restitution as a condition of work release or parole was not inherently unconstitutional.

The court would not disturb the weight given to the facts found. The court rejected the argument that a certain power sharing agreement was unfair. Although the utility gave up more energy than it received under the agreement, the agreement gave the utility the energy that it needed at the times that it was needed to serve its customers. The fact that the commission's findings and conclusions were the same as in a prior case was not grounds for reversal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court, Buncombe County (North Carolina), which defined clear proceeds as the amount collected by the city for overtime parking violations undiminished by direct and indirect costs of collection and held that such amount was to be paid to the county finance officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city appealed from a judgment of the trial court defining &quot;clear proceeds&quot; as the amount collected by the city for overtime parking violations undiminished by costs of collection. The court reversed and held that the term &quot;clear proceeds&quot; as used in N.C. Const. art. IX, &sect; 7 was synonymous with net proceeds and that costs of collection of a fine were deductible in determining clear proceeds. The question of how to define costs of collection was a legislative function. However, because the state legislature had not provided municipalities with a formula for determining clear proceeds, the court held that the test for determining permissible deductions from the gross amount collected was that the item to be deductible had to bear a reasonable relation to the costs of collection of the fine. A determination of such costs could be made by a qualified accountant. The trial court erred in ruling that the finding of the amount of collections was res judicata as to the board of education (board) because there was no indication that the board, who was not a party, assumed and managed the action. The city's other assignments of error were overruled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed that part of the judgment that defined clear proceeds and that held that the figure of total collections for all parking violations between certain dates would be res judicata upon the board of education.

The paternal heirs argued that &sect; 29-19(c) should be judicially amended to include N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-19(d), which allowed the decedent to inherit from the putative father who had acknowledged paternity in his will. Otherwise, they claimed, the distribution of the decedent's estate violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. On appeal, the court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-19(d) applied only when the child was taking under the will of a putative father; it did not apply to the paternal heirs. The court held that &sect; 29-19 was substantially related to the state's interests of equalizing the inheritance rights of illegitimate and legitimate children as far as practical. Holding that the requirement imposed on the putative father did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, the court affirmed the order of distribution.</SPAN></P>

The teacher sought judicial review of the decision, and the trial court reversed the board's determination. The board appealed the judgment. The court noted that the standard of review for the trial court was the whole record test, which required that in considering the substantiality of the evidence to support the findings of fact, the trial court must have taken into account whatever in the record fairly detracted from the weight of the evidence supporting the findings of fact. When all the evidence was considered which detracted from the evidence in support of the findings of fact, the court concluded that the board's findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence. The teacher also challenged the constitutionality of the dismissal statute,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115C-325(e)(1)(a). The court concluded that as applied to the teacher, he was given an objective standard with which a person of ordinary understanding could have determined compliance.

Thereafter, the felony charges against defendant were dismissed. Defendant filed a motion for speedy trial relief on the three felony charges, alleging that he had agreed to plead guilty to the felonies in exchange for the State's promise that he would receive concurrent two year sentences and that the State's failure to bring the charges before the trial court prejudiced him in that he was denied both parole consideration and his constitutional and statutory rights to a speedy trial.

The trial court concluded as a matter of law that the parents had neglected the minor pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-289.32(2).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father filed an action against the State asserting that the homeschooling of his children was a constitutionally protected activity, and presented evidence of that it satisfied N.C.

The court found no facts to prove that the home school was operated by a formal religious entity under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115C-554(4). The court ruled that &quot;school&quot; meant an educational institution, but not home instruction. The trial court incorrectly held that the father had constitutionally protected beliefs that required him to educate his children at home because his religious and socio-psychological beliefs did not outweigh the state's compelling interest in compulsory education.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court found that the legislature could reasonably determine that commercialized gambling for profit was a threat to the public order and morals and suppress it, while allowing religious and charitable organizations to conduct bingo games and raffles without violating the due process rights of defendant. The court found that allowing selected charitable organizations to conduct bingo games with the proceeds being donated to charitable, civic, community, benevolent, religious, scholastic, or similar endeavors for the general welfare removed bingo profits from the purview of organized gambling.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The propounders of the testatrix's 1977 will, three of the testatrix 's children, appealed a decision of the Superior Court, Wake County (North Carolina), which held for the caveators, two of the testatrix 's children, and found that the testatrix 's 1979 will was valid because the testatrix had testamentary capacity when the 1979 will was written and signed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The testatrix was found incompetent in February 1979, and a guardian was appointed. In November 1979, the testatrix executed a new will that provided for only three of her five children. After the testatrix's death, the 1979 will was admitted, as the jury specifically found that the testatrix had sufficient mental capacity to make and execute a valid will in November 1979. On appeal, the court affirmed and held, inter alia, that: (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting a document expert's testimony; (2) the jury's verdict was not contrary to the law relating to the testamentary capacity of one under guardianship, and the trial court did not err in denying the propounders' motion to set aside the verdict on that basis; (3) there was no merit to the propounders' contention that a new trial should have been granted because of the testatrix's &quot;insane delusion;&quot; (4) by not objecting to the jury charge in the trial court, the propounders waived their right to assert error based on the jury instructions; and (5) to the extent that the trial court erred in its jury instructions, the errors did not constitute &quot;plain errors&quot; which would mandate a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that although the deceased employee was the only one representing her division in North Carolina, the division was not a separate and distinct business, but was an integral part of the employer's business. The court observed that the fatal accident occurred in the middle of the deceased employee's territory, during business hours, on a highway between two towns which had stores on which she regularly called. The court pointed out that the employer verified that the deceased employee had appointments at stores in that area that day and that the evidence was not inadmissible hearsay because it did not show what the store representatives said and was not offered to show that what they said was true, but was offered to prove what the employer did to verify that the deceased employee was on the job when the accident occurred. The court concluded that N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A default judgment was entered against the father in a civil paternity action. The trial court denied his motion to set aside the entry of the default. The court affirmed on appeal, finding no error in the trial court's action. It was clear from the record that the summons and complaint were personally served on the father, that he was under no disability, and in fact had retained counsel. The fact that he believed the dismissal of criminal charges in the bastardy action meant that &quot;the matter was over with&quot; did not excuse his failure to respond to the subsequent summons and complaint. His failure to give the summons the attention which a person of ordinary prudence gave to his important business did not constitute excusable neglect under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1). Nor did the father show a meritorious defense to the complaint. His belief that the dismissal of the criminal charges put an end to the matter was not a basis upon which to excuse him for ignoring the summons and complaint. A statute of limitations defense failed as well because the court had held N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 149-14&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied to civil paternity actions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, while plaintiffs' franchises were neither tangible nor real property, they were nevertheless valuable property and plaintiffs' rights under those franchises were rights to the exclusive use and enjoyment thereof.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs maintained that the only characteristic under the city's zoning ordinance that differentiated mobile homes from modular and site built homes was that they were constructed in accordance with a different building code. However, the court held that it was obvious from the definitions in the ordinance that the different applicable building codes were not the only factor differentiating mobile homes from modular homes. The city was clearly authorized by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-381 to regulate and restrict the location and use of any buildings or structures for residential and other purposes, and that was exactly what it had done in restricting the location of mobile homes. The protection of property values in the zoned area was a legitimate governmental objective, and the court believed that the method of construction of homes could be determined by a city governing board as affecting the price of homes. The prohibition of such buildings was rationally related to the protection of the value of other homes in the area. The factual determination of the prices for mobile was a matter for the governing body of the city, and the court believed they were rational in their decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was operating a bus that failed to halt at a stop sign. The resulting accident caused the victim's death. Defendant was convicted of charges arising from the incident. The court affirmed the judgment, first rejecting the claim that former N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18A-21 barred the warrantless search of defendant's briefcase. The section was applicable only to searches of vehicles used for illegal transportation of alcohol. The court also found that the search of defendant's briefcase was permissible under the Fourth Amendment. Analogizing to the standards applicable to the inventory exception to the warrant requirement, the court noted that the police searched the briefcase in order to establish how best to safeguard the contents after the accident. The court further ruled that the superior court did not err when it admitted evidence of defendant's refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test. Such evidence was not violative of the North Carolina Constitution or defendant's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The court also rejected defendant's claims regarding other evidence admitted at trial, the denial of his motion to dismiss, and jury instructions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant putative property owner sought review of the judgment by the Craven County Superior Court (North Carolina), which awarded judgment to plaintiff State of North Carolina and held that the State, as a matter of law, was the presumptive owner of the unclaimed property under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 146-79 and that the owner failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it held superior title to the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State alleged that it owned the property in question and that the putative owners and others were trespassing on it. The owner was the only defendant who appeared at trial. The owner alleged that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 146-79 (1983) was unconstitutional because it impermissibly permitted a presumption of title in the State by shifting the burden of proof regarding title ownership to the possessor of a land, such as the owner. The trial court denied the owner's motion to dismiss action and concluded that the State was the owner of the land and was entitled to an injunction against the owner. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that &sect; 146-79 did not amount to an unconstitutional taking of land. The court noted that the North Carolina Legislature had the power to change the burden of proof in civil cases and that presumptions were lawful where, as here, there was a rational connection between the fact to be proven, the State's ownership of the land, and the facts that form the basis of the presumption, that the State had title ownership of the property. The court accepted the finding that the owner's record ownership did not accurately describe the property.</SPAN></P>

Supp. 1981) but denied the petition because there was no evidence that she was likely to engage in sexual activity. The court affirmed the denial of sterilization but reversed in part because of erroneous findings of facts and conclusions of law. The court found that the sterilization statute did not offend equal protection, nor was it vague or arbitrary. The trial court properly interpreted &sect; 35-43 to require a showing that the woman was likely to engage in sexual activity without contraceptive devices and was likely to become impregnated and properly found that the department failed to establish such a showing. The court established standards for sterilization of mentally retarded individuals, and the court found no error in the application of those standards. The department further failed to show that sterilization was in the woman's best interest, and thus the trial court's conclusion of law was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurer requested a rate increase which was refused by the commissioner because the insurer was first required by 11 N.C.

The insurer filed an action challenging the refusal of the rate increase and the constitutionality of &sect; 12.0502. The trial court affirmed the commissioner's denial of the rate increase. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court's decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious and that the commissioner did not exceed his authority by promulgating &sect; 12.0502 because it was supported by legislative intent. The court found that requiring the notice of nonrenewal was neither unfair to the policy holder nor the insurer because it allowed the policyholder the choice of continuing coverage and paying a higher rate or finding other coverage and gave the insurer an opportunity to recoup some of its losses. In addition, the court held &sect; 12.0502 was constitutional, thus there was no constitutional violation to sustain the insurer's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant stole several long guns, a pistol, a wallet, and several jars of coins. One of the jars was a mustard jar that contained coins and a white envelope with the name of a church on it. A sheriff's deputy stopped defendant's getaway car. The deputy seized the car, drove it to the county where the crime took place, obtained a search warrant for the guns, and searched the car. The warrant did not describe the wallet or the coin jars. In searching for the guns, he found an old brown wallet and a mustard jar that contained coins and a white envelope with the name of the church in a box in the trunk. Because the deputy did not know that those items also were stolen, he released the car. Defendant argued that it was error to permit the deputy to testify regarding his discovery of the wallet and mustard jar because it exceeded the scope of the warrant. The court affirmed the conviction and held that the testimony was admissible under the &quot;plain view&quot; doctrine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners argued that the deed was not void and that they were tenants in common with the wife.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment in favor of defendants, finding that the deed, which purported to convey property to the deceased without complying with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-6(a), was void. The court noted that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-8 did not validate the deed because &sect; 52-8 specifically did not apply to pending litigation. The court rejected petitioners' sex discrimination argument, holding that they did not have standing to attack the constitutionality of the statute. The daughter's injury was due to the deceased's failure to comply with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-6 and not because the N.C. gen. Stat. &sect; 52-8 was discriminatory to her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company filed a lawsuit against defendants in which it alleged that the Anson County violated N.C. Const. art.

II, &sect; 24 because it was addressed to the county's natural resources. The trial court held that the Act violated N.C. Const. art.

The Act directly related to sanitation, as the sole purpose of the Act was the disposal of waste.

The trial court found in favor of the State and the court affirmed. It found that the statutory presumption was constitutional, as title to lands in the State originated from the State. Further, the statute did not authorize a taking of the property and the presumption lasted only until the rival claimant established valid title. It then found that one group of the title claimants had not possessed the land for the requisite period of time and could not claim color of title due to the insufficiency of the description in the deed on which they relied. The court also held that another title claimant could not rely on a deed in his chain of title, because it lacked evidence of full execution. Finally, another group of title claimants failed to make out a case of adverse possession, as one member of that group testified that he gave a deed to third party for the property and that he and his brother exchanged deeds in an attempt to create title to the property.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed. A physician's observations supported his conclusion and the court's finding that she was mentally ill.

She next challenged the involuntary commitment statute for failure to provide counsel for petitioner. She argued that the procedure violated her rights to due process, equal protection, and a fair and impartial hearing. However, she was effectively represented by counsel, and the court had difficulty finding that she was prejudiced for lack of representation for petitioner. She also claimed that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 122-58.7(b), 122-58.24 were unconstitutional for providing the State representation at hearings held at regional psychiatric centers but not other locations, and claimed it was unconstitutional for the trial judge to preside at hearings as well as question witnesses.

Further, the court rejected defendant's assertions that &sect; 130-160 was unconstitutionally vague, finding that persons of ordinary intelligence could understand its meaning. Although defendant asserted that the evidence indicated that the sanitary system in his place of business operated properly, the court noted that this was irrelevant in that this system was not sanitary. The court rejected defendant's assertion that the trial judge improperly commented on the evidence when it issued instructions to the jury. Defendant claimed that the trial judge erred by not instructing the jury that he could not be convicted unless he had willfully violated the provisions of &sect; 130-160, but willfulness was not a component of N.C.

The detective relied upon information reported to him by other officers and the victims of the alleged robberies. Defendant excepted to the failure of the trial court to instruct on the offenses of common law robbery and larceny, but defendant admitted that she wielded both a knife and a gun during commission of the offense. Because the State presented evidence of aiding and abetting by defendant, the trial court properly instructed the jury on the law of aiding and abetting. The State was not required to present evidence that defendant personally committed each essential element of armed robbery.

The court was unable to find reversible error. The Commission was required to establish a rate based by ascertaining the reasonable original cost of a public utility's property used and useful, or to be used and useful within a reasonable time after a test period plus the reasonable original cost of investment in a plant under construction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant town sought review of a decision by the Superior Court, Dare County (North Carolina), which entered judgment in favor of plaintiff company and found that a town sign ordinance was preempted by the state Outdoor Advertising Control Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. 136-126, and that the town ordinance was overbroad and exceeded the town's police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A company opposed a town ordinance which prohibited off-premises advertising signs within the town. The lower court entered judgment in favor of the company. Upon appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the town was authorized to outlaw outdoor advertising which was not regulated by state law and to provide compensation by amortization since the state act's compensation provision had no relevance. The court found that the sign restriction was within the police power of the town based on the zoning scheme and stated objectives of the town. The ordinance did not unconstitutionally restrict freedom of speech because it is expressly limited to commercial signs. The ordinance did not violate equal protection because the town's legitimate interests could reasonably have been found to outweigh one classification of private interest, but not another. The company's cross-appeal regarding the denial of its 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim was affirmed as there was no basis for such a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, an automobile manufacturer and a franchise applicant, sought review from an order from the Superior Court of Wake County (North Carolina), which denied a stay of an order by respondent, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, which revoked, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-305(5), the franchise that petitioner manufacturer had given to petitioner applicant. Intervenor, a franchise owner, was already given a right to area at issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners argued that the trial court abused its discretion in not staying the order and also argued that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-305(5), violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 34, because it was unconstitutional on its face as allowing a monopoly to respondent intervenor. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the state could require that if petitioner manufacturer granted a franchise to respondent intervenor to sell automobiles, that petitioner manufacturer would include in the terms of the franchise agreement the right that respondent intervenor had an exclusive franchise in a certain trade area so long as respondent intervenor would abide by the terms of the franchise agreement. Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-301(b), respondent had the power to prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Granting of a franchise in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-305(5), would be an unfair act or practice. Pursuant to &sect; 20-305(5), a franchise might not be granted to a dealership unless the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles determined that the market could support it and must notify other franchise owners, which might already be providing the particular line.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the denial of motion to stay respondent's order, holding that state could require that if petitioner manufacturer gave a franchise to respondent intervenor, petitioner manufacturer could include in terms of franchise agreement right that respondent intervenor would have exclusive franchise in a certain trade area. Statute gave respondent intervenor some protection after it made investments, relying on contracts it had made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Wilson County Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted defendant of trafficking in cocaine in violation of N.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had moved to dismiss on grounds that &quot;a derivative of coca leaves&quot; was not included within the language of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-95(h)(3) and, alternatively, on grounds that the statute was unconstitutionally vague as to whether &quot;a derivative of coca leaves&quot; was included within its terms. The full definition of cocaine in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-90(a)4 may have been read into the trafficking in cocaine provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-95(h)(3). Defendant was provided with sufficient notice for him to determine that the conduct, which the State's evidence tended to show was proscribed. The trial judge did not err in admitting the cocaine into evidence. The defense cured any deficiency in the State's proof by eliciting testimony on cross examination. Defendant also objected to a question asked during cross-examination of a defense witness. Defendant only objected &quot;to the form of the question.&quot; He did not allege such prejudice as denied him a fair trial, and he did not move for a mistrial on the basis of the question. The question did not reach the level of gross impropriety or the level of inflammatory impact that would have required a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina), which denied defendant's motion to suppress. Defendant was indicted for trafficking in heroin, a violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-95(h)(4)(a). After the denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized during a search of his premises, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the lesser-included offense of simple possession of heroin.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that the search was conducted pursuant to a valid search warrant and that the sergeant announced, &quot;police&quot; at the same time as he was crossing the threshold and entering the premises. The trial court concluded that any violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 15A-241 to -259 was &quot;merely technical in nature and effect&quot; and was not substantial enough to require exclusion pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-974. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized during the search because the warrant authorizing the search was based upon an affidavit that was insufficient to establish probable cause for issuance of the warrant. A reasonable reading of the application for the search warrant led the court to conclude that it contained sufficient facts to allow issuance of the search warrant. Even though the officers violated the statutory requirements for execution of the search warrant, the deviation from lawful conduct was not extensive or willful. The violation of the statutes governing warrant execution, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 15A-249-251, were not substantial enough to require suppression of evidence seized during the search.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed a decision by the Superior Court, Alamance County (North Carolina), which held that N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with violating N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-53 et seq. by selling pharmaceuticals without a pharmacist's license, and the superior court dismissed the case on the ground that the statutes were overbroad and vague. The court reversed and remanded defendant's case, found the statutes constitutional, and held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-72, -73 did not give the terms &quot;drug&quot; and &quot;medicine&quot; their broad, popularly accepted meanings for purposes of regulating their manufacture or sale. Because those sections provided that the conduct proscribed therein were misdemeanors subject to specified punishment, they provided sufficient notice for defendant to determine whether his conduct in each case was proscribed. The court ruled that the concept of overbreadth did not apply to those sections because they did not include such &quot;over-the-counter&quot; drugs as headache and cold remedies commonly sold by general merchants. Moreover, the statutes dealt with the practice of pharmacy, which the State could regulate for the public health, safety, and welfare, so they did not invade any area of constitutionally protected freedom and the doctrine of overbreadth did not apply to them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners contended that N.C. Gen.

The court found that N.C. Gen.

The clerk properly exercised her discretionary authority to appoint the drainage district commissioners. Neither mandamus nor a mandatory injunction could be issued to control the manner of a public official's exercise of a discretionary duty. The landowners complaint stated a defective claim in that it requested relief that the clerk be enjoined from appointing commissioners and that the commissioners be enjoined from accepting appointment, which the court was powerless to grant regardless of what facts could have been proven.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent parents challenged a decision from the Cumberland County District Court (North Carolina), which terminated their parental rights as to their five minor children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents argued, inter alia, that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-289.32(2) and (4), under which their parental rights were terminated, were unconstitutionally vague and that the evidence did not support the trial court's findings. The mother also argued that she and the father were entitled to a directed verdict and that the evidence did not establish the statutory grounds terminating parental rights. The court found that &sect; 7A-289.32 was not unconstitutionally vague. The provision was sufficiently definite to be applied in a uniform manner to protect both the State's substantial interest in the welfare of minor children and the parents' fundamental right to the integrity of their family unit. The trial court's findings were supported by detailed accounts of the children's emotional and mental health as well as their physical health and appearance. Finally, there was sufficient evidence to support the finding that the children were abused and neglected under &sect; 7A-289.32(2), and there was no error in the entry of the written order. There was no requirement that the written order be entered within 10 days after the oral order was made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of his conviction entered on a jury verdict in the Dare County Superior Court (North Carolina) of growing marijuana. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in beginning a suppression hearing when he was not present, erred in denying his motion to suppress, erred in its jury instructions and that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-101 was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a physician who claimed that he grew the marijuana to dispense to his patients and that because he had an expectation of privacy on his property, a search warrant was required before officers could enter his property. Defendant also claimed that the jury charges on constructive possession and intent were erroneous and that &sect; 90-101 was unconstitutionally vague because it led him to believe that he could grow and possess marijuana for the use of his patients. The court found no error. There was no question that defendant's counsel intended to waive defendant's presence at the suppression hearing. Also, defendant failed to show any prejudice by his absence from a part of the hearing. A reasonable expectation of privacy did not affect the officers' right to seize the marijuana without a search warrant when they were invited onto the property and where the marijuana was in plain view. Taken as a whole, there was no error in the jury instructions. Section 90-101, which allowed a physician to possess marijuana in a pharmaceutical form, would not lead a physician of common intelligence to believe he could grow and possess marijuana in its raw form.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father failed pay any portion of the cost of care of his children for about 18 months, and the trial court determined that his failure to contribute to the cost was unreasonable. The father, who was incarcerated, had the opportunity to participate in a work-release program, but had lost that privilege by returning from the program in a highly intoxicated condition. The trial court terminated the father's parental rights, and on appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. Section 7A-289.32(4) was not unconstitutionally vague, and the father's prison records were admissible pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-34 as an authenticated copy of a Department of Corrections document and as relevant evidence of his removal from the work-release program. Because the father was removed from the program because of his own misconduct, his failure to pay was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court determined that the mother's child was a neglected child or juvenile. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the statutory definition of &quot;neglected child&quot; in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-289.32(2) was not unconstitutionally vague because the terms used in &sect; 7A-278(4) were given a precise and understandable meaning by the normative standards imposed upon parents by society; (2) &sect; 7A-289.32(2) did not violate equal protection safeguards because the classification of neglected children was founded upon reasonable distinctions, affected all persons similarly situated without discrimination, and had a reasonable relation to the public peace, welfare, and safety; (3) the conclusion that the child was a neglected child or juvenile was supported by substantial competent evidence because the mother refused to permit the child to receive an opportunity to progress toward her full development; and (4) the trial court had authority to enter orders for the treatment of the child after notice of appeal was entered in the case because &sect; 7A-668 allowed temporary orders affecting the custody or placement of a juvenile in the best interest of the juvenile or the state.</SPAN></P>
