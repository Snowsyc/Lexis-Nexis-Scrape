<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant filed an action for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution against the police officers and the city, stemming from his arrest for disorderly conduct. The circuit court directed a verdict for defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the claimant's conviction conclusively established probable cause. The court concluded that under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 708-3, a police officer could lawfully arrest a person without a warrant if the officer had probable cause to believe an offense was being committed in his presence, even though it was a misdemeanor. The claimant's warrantless arrest was made by the police officers who, according to their account, saw and observed what reasonable persons would have believed to be an offense being committed in their presence. The fact that it later turned out that they were mistaken in their belief would not have converted the arrest based upon probable cause into an unlawful one. The court found no evidence of fraud, perjury or other corrupt means, which would have vitiated the claimant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also appealed his sentence of life imprisonment under the extended term provisions of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 706-661 and 706-662(4) as a multiple offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raped and sodomized a social worker that he was referred to for counseling regarding a pending rape charge. After a jury trial, defendant was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentence. The court held that: (1) the social worker's testimony was admissible, even though she made references to defendant's alleged past crimes, because the testimony was both relevant and material to prove the element of forcible compulsion and to explain why the social worker feared defendant; (2) the trial court did not err in giving the robbery instruction to the jury over defendant's objection because defendant did not present specific grounds for his objection on the record and the social worker was kept under a continuing threat of force and violence by defendant's use of a knife; and (3) defendant's life sentence under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 706-661, 706-662 was not cruel and unusual punishment in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII or Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 because his sentence was not so disproportionate to his crimes as to be shocking to the conscience or an outrage to the moral sense of the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants in consolidated cases were charged with violating Haw. Penal Code &sect; 1249, which made it a crime to knowingly and unlawfully possess marijuana. The trial court held that the statute was unconstitutional insofar as it related to mere possession of marijuana, and the state appealed. The trial court placed on the state the burden of showing clearly and convincingly that the possession of marijuana in violation of &sect; 1249 constituted a harm either to the individual or the community. The trial court found that the state had not met its burden and that &sect; 1249 violated the due process clauses of the state and United States constitutions. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court because there was a presumption of constitutionally of the statute. The court concluded that, when a substance was proscribed as harmful, the presumption of constitutionality applied although there were conflicting scientific views as to its harmful effects, and that it was within the prerogative of the legislature to make the decision that possession of marijuana should not have been decriminalized.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were candidates in a primary election. They were charged with the offense of failure to file a statement of expenses. The district court dismissed the charges, finding that defendants complied with &sect; 11-193. The court reversed and remanded. It held that the term &quot;primary election&quot; as used in &sect; 11-193 was clear, plain, and unambiguous. It did not need any judicial interpretation and had to be applied strictly in accordance with its ordinary and popular usage. Because the primary election was held in on October 7, 1972, all candidates who were not nominated should have filed their expense statements on or before Friday, October 27, 1972. There was nothing in the statutes to exclude Saturdays and Sundays in the computation of the 20 days after the period began to run. The exclusion of Saturdays and Sundays was unauthorized. It was an abuse of discretion to dismiss the charges as de minimis infractions, without any indicators to show that each of the offenses was in fact an innocent, technical infraction, not actually causing or threatening any harm or evil sought to be prevented by &sect; 11-193.</SPAN></P>

The city filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that the minor and parents failed to comply with the six-month notice required by Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 46-72. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city. The minor and parents appealed, contending that the six-month notice requirement was superseded by the two-year statute of limitations set forth in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 662-4. On appeal, the court reversed and held that &sect; 662-4 was the applicable statute of limitations and that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 46-72 and Honolulu, Hi., Charter of the City and County, &sect; 12-106 were invalid because they were in conflict with &sect; 662-4. It would have been unreasonable to hold that a the right to recover damages in tort from the city and county of Honolulu, a subdivision of the state, created by the legislature, was more restricted than the right to recover from the state itself.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court reasoned that the beneficiaries had no property or other right to participate in the choice of a new trustee. The court also found that since no compensation whatsoever was provided for the exercise of the power of appointment of the estate trustees, such exercise was not within the constitutional prohibition against the simultaneous holding of an office or position of profit and the holding of the office of Hawaii Supreme Court Justice.

Upon his refusal, the officer executed and filed an affidavit with the magistrate as required under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 286-156. The trial court revoked defendant's license pursuant to Haw. Rev.

Defendant was not denied procedural due process because &sect; 286-155 definitively provided what was to be stated in the affidavit, which forewarned and gave defendant notice as to the contents of the affidavit. Furthermore, Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 286-156 provided for a hearing to determine the correctness of the statements in the affidavit. Thus, the statutes provided the necessary constitutional procedural due process safeguards.

The circuit court found that the engineer and the general contractor were not liable under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 657-8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child suffered injuries when a portion of the building owners' roof fell on her. The guardian ad litem filed an action for damages against the building owners. The building owners then filed a third-party complaint against the engineer and the general contractor for negligence and breach of warranty. The engineer and the general contractor filed a motion for summary judgment. They alleged that their services were rendered on the building, which had been completed more than 10 years before the collapse of the roof. Thus, under &sect; 657-8, they were not liable for contribution or indemnity. The trial court granted the motion. On appeal, the court reversed. Assuming that the engineer and the general contractor were negligent and that their negligence was the proximate cause of the injuries, in applying &sect; 657-8, the building owners were not able to recover from the engineer and the general contractor. The court concluded that there was no rational basis for treating them differently from the building owners under the same circumstances. Section 657-8 called for arbitrary and capricious discrimination and was an invidious discrimination violative of the equal protection guaranty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested in violation of the Honolulu's curfew ordinance, while sitting in front of a house. The referee found that defendant had been a passenger in a car involved in a high speed chase through the city, that he had not gone directly home from a movie, and that he was a law violator. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance and filed a motion to dismiss the referee's findings, which were confirmed by the circuit court. On appeal, the court reversed the circuit court's order, holding that the Honolulu curfew ordinance prohibiting loitering by juveniles at night was so vague and overbroad as to violate due process standards. The term &quot;loitering&quot; was simply too vague and imprecise because it failed to give proper notice as to what conduct constituted unlawful activity and, in addition, its broad sweep had the effect of inhibiting otherwise lawful conduct. The court concluded, therefore, that the ordinance was so vague and overbroad that it violated defendant's constitutional due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The landlord served upon the tenant a notice to vacate at the end of the month. After the tenant refused to vacate, the landlord filed its action. The tenant claimed that the primary purpose of the eviction was to hamper the tenants' union, for which the tenant was the organizer, in violation of the tenant's rights of freedom of speech. The court affirmed the summary judgment for the landlord because the tenant did not raise a valid constitutional defense to the action. The tenant's U.S. Const. amend. I rights were not infringed by requiring the tenant to vacate the premises. The tenant would still be allowed to retain membership in the tenants' union and speak as freely about the condition of the premises as when he was in possession of the premises. The tenant, as a month-to-month tenant, did not have a right to demand that his tenancy be extended once the current term expired. Furthermore, there was no state action involved by the landlord's resort to court in order to force the tenant to vacate the premises, even if the landlord's motivation was to stifle the tenant's organization of the tenants' union.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorneys for the estate's trustees argued that the issue was not properly before the court. They contended that the attorney general's request was actually for one for an advisory opinion and that the matter did not present a justiciable case of controversy. The court held that it was proper for the trial court to advise the trustees in an accounting action. Alternatively, the attorneys argued that it was entirely proper for the trustees to take commissions on the real estate taxes in question. The court found that, under Haw. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 607-20 (1968), such commissions were proper. Another major question raised concerned the amount of the award of the master's fee. While the report submitted by the master was well written and perceptive, the court refused to find that the trial court abused its discretion in the fee amount awarded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Director of Taxation (director) challenged an order of the First Circuit Court (Hawaii) that reversed its general excise tax assessment on gross commission income against appellee taxpayers, who were state travel agencies. The taxpayers cross-appealed that the trial court erred in holding that the Commerce Clause did not bar assessment of the general excise tax upon sales commissions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The director assessed the general excise tax under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 237-13. The trial court held that there was no rational relationship between the purposes of the state excise tax law and the director's decision to assess the travel agents but not the carriers. On appeal, the director argued that it was error to find that the taxpayers and the carriers were similarly situated as to taxability and that the taxpayers' recourse was to seek a writ of mandamus to compel the director to assess the carriers rather than to seek a refund. The court reversed the trial court. The court found that the excise tax did not single out interstate commerce for discriminatory treatment and the tax was applied at the same rate to all businesses rendering services in the state, intrastate and interstate alike. There was no problem with apportionment because the taxpayers' business activity was conducted exclusively within the state. Assessing a general excise tax upon the taxpayers' commission income posed no threat of multiple taxation. If the taxpayers believed that the director refused to assess the carriers, they could seek a writ of mandamus in the trial court to force the director to act.</SPAN></P>

If the taxpayers believed that the director refused to assess the general excise tax against interstate and international carriers, they were free to seek a writ of mandamus in the trial court to compel the director to do so.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court found that the legislature's act of defining of the term narcotic so as to include marijuana and the inclusion of marijuana within the same class as the more harmful narcotic drugs was not so unreasonable and arbitrary as to violate the constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process of law. The court also found that it was no violation of the guarantee of due process of law for the legislature to employ such usage over the more precise usage favored by the scientific community. The court also found that defendants did not establish that the interest of an individual in possessing and using marijuana was within the class of interests to which the state and federal constitutions accord the highest degree of protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Intervenor state sought review of a decree of the Family Court of the Third Circuit (Hawaii) that granted plaintiff wife a divorce from defendant husband. On appeal, the state contended that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter a divorce decree in favor of the wife because the wife had not resided for one year in the state as required by Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 580-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife filed a complaint for divorce against the husband in the trial court on the basis that she suffered grievous mental suffering at the hands of the husband for more than 60 days. The state intervened in the action, and contended that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the action because the wife had failed to reside in Hawaii for the period set forth in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 580-1 prior to the commencement of the action. The trial court in turn dispensed with the state's claim and granted the wife a decree of divorce. On appeal, the court considered the validity of the residential requirement contained in &sect; 580-1. It determined that the residential requirement for divorce in the second sentence of &sect; 580-1 was not in violation of the equal protection clause under the traditional equal protection standard because Hawaii was justified in requiring such an objective test of the establishment of domicile. Additionally, the court concluded that the probability that the residential requirement operated to deter a person's exercise of his or her fundamental right to travel interstate was too remote to render it invalid. Accordingly, the trial court's decree was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged with being barricaded in a room, where gambling implements were exhibited, to prevent police access. The court of appeals dismissed the charges against defendants because it found that &sect; 746-6 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the state supreme court affirmed the dismissal of the charges against defendants. The court held that &sect; 746-6 was vague and overbroad and therefore violated the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The court found that any home built with locks would fall under &sect; 746-6. The court also found that any person in a room of his home where cards or chips were in view would be violating &sect; 746-6. The court noted that neither the relative insignificance of the crime of &sect; 746-6 nor the slightness of the penalty imposed lessened the infringement on freedom of movement and association. The court also held that &sect; 746-6 denied freedom of movement and freedom of association, guaranteed by Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents contended on appeal that the sex education program adopted by the state was unconstitutional because it unduly interfered with their right of privacy and freedom of religion. The court found that the state, in formulating policies for the adoption of the program, anticipated possible objections by parents to the context of the film series. The court found the state's excusal system to be an effort to allow those parents or guardians who might object to the program or parts thereof on moral or religious grounds to have their children excused. The program was in no way compulsory, and, therefore, the state did not contravene the parents' right of privacy. The court further failed to find any direct or substantial burden on the parents' free exercise of religion. Inasmuch as there was no compulsion or coercion related to the educational program in question, the court found no violation of the First Amendment's Free Exercise of Religion Clause. The court further held that the program in question was not illegal because it was adopted by an improper delegation of authority by the State Board of Education to the administrative staff of the State Department of Education.</SPAN></P>

Defendant demonstrators sought review of the judgment, which held that the chancellor, school official, and state were entitled to permanent injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The demonstrators entered the chancellor's office, which was located on the university campus. They wished to protest the university's handling of an incident that involved a nationalist Chinese grantee who had been recalled by his government and imprisoned. The chancellor later arrived at his office and met with the demonstrators and left. The demonstrators remained, and the next day eight copies of complaints and TROs were served upon them. The first complaint was filed by the chancellor and the school official, on behalf of the university, which sought equitable remedy under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 603-22. The second was filed for the state to enjoin the demonstrators, pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 603-23, from violating the criminal trespass statute. Subsequently, the circuit court found that the TROs were invalid and granted the permanent injunctive relief to the chancellor, school official, and state. The court reversed in part the judgment, holding that the TROs were not constitutionally invalid because the continuing obstruction of the use of the office constituted conduct, not speech, that was clearly outside the scope of the First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were convicted in the Circuit Court First Circuit (Hawaii) of lewdness for having masturbated in public restrooms in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 768-52(2). On appeal defendants challenged the jury array on the ground that the three-year residential requirement for a citizen of Hawaii to serve on the jury, Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 609-1, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court stated that there was substantial evidence to support the guilty verdicts against defendant. The court went on to hold that the three-year residential qualification for jurors of Hawaii did not violate the privileges and immunities clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV because the privilege to serve as a juror in the courts of Hawaii belonged to one as a citizen of the State of Hawaii and not as a citizen of the United States. The court also held that the statute did not violate the equal protection or due process clauses. Defendants argued that they met their burden of proving the statute was unconstitutional by merely averring that it did not treat all the citizens or residents of Hawaii equally. The court disagreed holding that defendants failed to prove that the three-year residential qualification was an invidious discrimination or even that it was an unreasonable classification. Thus, the statute was deemed constitutional and defendants' convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board of the DLNR voted to expedite the capture of axis deer on two other islands and to have them shipped and held on the island of Hawaii.

After trial, an injunction against the release of the deer was entered and the DLNR appealed. The court reversed and ordered that the petition be dismissed, holding that the DLNR had not acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or capriciously. Rather, the court found that the actions were taken after careful and lengthy study and in order to increase the recreational potential of that island, and to add a new big game species to the scene. The court concluded that it was a reasonable exercise of the police power of the state and accordingly, there were no constitutional violations. The actions should not have been enjoined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state sought review of an order of a magistrate of the District Court of Honolulu (Hawaii) that granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charge against him. Defendant was charged with placing, leaving or depositing upon a sidewalk goods, wares, or merchandise in violation of Rev. Laws Haw. &sect; 142-27 (1955) (statute) and a magistrate struck down the statute as vague and unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with placing, leaving, or depositing upon a sidewalk goods, wares, or merchandise in violation of the statute. He claimed that the statute violated the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and Haw. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 4, 6, 20 and was overbroad, left too much to the enforcement officers, and was susceptible of discrimination. The magistrate invalidated the statute due to the absence of any standard by which to measure the act condemned, such as purpose or duration or volume. On appeal, the court first determined that the statute was not a loitering statute and therefore, not subject to special scrutiny. Furthermore, defendant did not have a constitutional right to bring along a table and chair and take up occupancy. According to the court, the purpose of the statute was to prevent obstruction of the streets in presumably congested urban areas. The court reversed and held that the magistrate demanded too much when he faulted the statute for failing to specify the purpose, duration, or volume of the act condemned because custom and usage as to the ordinary use of a sidewalk supplied the standard to be applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the magistrate's order that dismissed the charge against defendant for placing, leaving, or depositing upon a sidewalk goods, wares, or merchandise in violation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner foreign corporation filed a petition for a writ of prohibition after the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawaii) determined that service of summons by filing the same with the Director of Regulatory Agencies of Hawaii subjected the foreign corporation to jurisdiction in an action by respondents, wife and children of the deceased, to recover for the death of the deceased as a result of injuries suffered in an elevator accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife of the deceased filed an action in her individual capacity and as representative of her two infant children alleging that the foreign corporation negligently installed the elevator, causing the accident. The circuit court found that it had jurisdiction over the foreign corporation under Rev. Laws. Haw. &sect; 172-150. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 172-150 applied only if the foreign corporation had undertaken to do or carry on business in the state. The court further held that the test to determine whether the foreign corporation had undertaken to do business in the state was whether the installation of the elevator bore a relevant relation to the contract made for its sale, i.e., the incidental nature of the work performed in the state. The court found that the circuit court had not correctly interpreted &sect; 172-150 and had not addressed the factual questions presented. Therefore, the court remanded for the circuit court to determine whether the foreign corporation was within the ambit of Rev. Laws Haw. &sect; 174-1 as a corporation whose business was partly intrastate, which was required under Rev. Laws Haw. &sect; 172-150 for service to be made on the Director of Regulatory Agencies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted in part the foreign corporation's petition for a writ, only restraining further prosecution of the action against the foreign corporation on the basis of the circuit court's decision. The court remanded the case for the circuit court to allow the wife of the deceased to introduce proper evidence that the foreign corporation was a corporation whose business was partly intrastate, or to attempt to effect service by other means.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trucking business taxpayers sought review of a judgment, which denied a challenge to an income tax levied by the state tax collector, contending the tax upon gross income violated the commerce clause. The trucking business taxpayers contended the tax was an invalid levy on the privilege of doing interstate business, and corporations engaged in doing exclusive interstate business were not subject to tax for such a privilege whether or not they were local or foreign corporations. The court rejected the trucking business taxpayers' arguments, concluding that the income based upon contracts with a mainland carrier that involved interstate shipments of goods was not a burden on interstate commerce because all the trucking business taxpayers' activities were performed within the state. The court found that the tax was valid, explaining that the commerce clause did not proscribe all state imposed burdens on interstate commerce. The court found that the state sought merely to impose a tax upon the activities and aspects of the businesses, which were subject to the sovereign power of the state, and the tax did not reach any activities, which might have been performed outside the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The public contract was for the installing, equipping, and operating of a food and beverage facilities concession at new airport terminal facilities. The unsuccessful bidder and the taxpayer argued that mandamus was required to stop an improperly awarded contract. The state agency contended that a grant of mandamus was within the sole discretion of the court and should have been denied because the contract with the successful bidder had not only been executed but a very substantial part of the contract's performance had been undertaken and the public would have been greatly damaged by a grant of the relief prayed for. The court found that the taxpayer and unsuccessful bidder failed to make out a case for judicial intervention because the court could not have granted a writ of mandamus where work under the contract on the part of the successful bidder had proceeded to the point where one restaurant in a terminal was in operation and work on the restaurant in another was in the planning stages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Decedent started a trust, the net income of which was to be used for charitable purposes during the decedent's lifetime. On her death, the net income was to be divided among her nieces and nephews or their lawful surviving issue. After her death, the department of taxation assessed against the executors, on account of the property transferred under the trust indenture of February 21, 1938, additional inheritance taxes and interest based on a valuation of the trust property of $ 238,490.51 and distributed according to law and the trust indenture among the heirs and legatees. The executors paid the taxes owed into escrow and then brought an action to challenge their validity. The court held that the department was correct in charging inheritance tax on the trust property. The test of taxability was not whether there was a complete divesting of the decedent's interest or ownership at the time of execution and delivery of the instrument of transfer or whether she reserved some interest or power until her death but rather whether complete succession took place at or after her death. Since the transfer took place after decedent's death, the trust was subject to inheritance tax.</SPAN></P>

After his death, the mortgagee agreed to waive settlement in the probate court and rely upon its mortgage for collection. Two years later the mortgagee foreclosed on its mortgage by entry. Plaintiffs alleged that the foreclosure by entry occurred with knowledge that they were minors and was not valid. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment for the mortgagee. The court reasoned that plaintiffs, as heirs of their mother, an heir of the mortgagor, had inherited an interest in the land. The foreclosure by entry was valid against plaintiffs even though they were minors at the time. There was no statutory exception for minors. The statute provided a one-year redemption period, Rev. Laws Haw. &sect; 336-12 (1955), and after that expired the redemption right of the mortgagor and all persons claiming under him was forever barred. The redemption right was only a statutory right. The court could not place disability exceptions that extended the operation of statutes of limitations for real property actions onto the redemption right.

The court affirmed and held that despite the broad scope and protection of the First Amendment freedoms and privileges, none of them was absolute. Whether an asserted right under that amendment would prevail depended upon the particular circumstances involved and the weighing and balancing of the protection afforded by the right asserted against the purposes that would have been defeated or denied. There was no First Amendment protection available to reporter because the impairment was not of a degree sufficient to outweigh the necessity of maintaining the court's fundamental authority to compel the attendance of witnesses and their testimony. Although the questions asked of reporter were not relevant to the underlying case, they were reasonably calculated to lead to discoverable evidence. Haw. R. Civ. P. 26. There was no reason for or logic in limiting a private litigant's right to testimony merely because the cause arose out of or involved official action. No statutory privilege against disclosure was extended to newsmen. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In consolidated cases, defendants appealed a decision of the Circuit Court, First Circuit (Hawaii), which entered a jury verdict convicting them of robbery and denied their motion for a new trial. Defendants argued that the charges varied from the proof because the victims were robbed of stolen property. They also argued that the state and federal exclusionary rules should have barred evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In consolidated cases, two defendants were convicted of robbery. One defendant lured a driver to a secluded area, took his cash and his car, and kidnapped the driver and the occupants. The occupants told defendant that they knew where a stash of money from another crime was hidden. The other defendant took cash from the place the occupants had identified. Defendants argued that they were not guilty of robbery because none of the cash taken had actually belonged to their victims. The circuit court charged the jury that stolen money could be the subject of robbery or a larceny. Defendants' motion for a new trial was denied. On appeal, the court explained that there was no fatal variance between the proof and the charge; for the purposes of a common law pleading of robbery, a thief in possession could be described as the owner when goods were taken by a second thief. The court also held that defendants lacked standing to assert the exclusionary rule, as applied under the Fourth Amendment or the state constitution. As trespassers, they had no right of privacy in the car or the premises that were searched. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendants' convictions for robbery and the denial of their motions for a directed verdict and for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of the misdemeanor of being present at a game prohibited by Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 288-4 (1955) in the Circuit Court First Circuit (Hawaii). She was sentenced to pay a fine and appealed her conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The question on appeal was whether the game &quot;Fascination&quot; was a game prohibited by Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 288-4. The court concluded that the legislature did not use the phrase &quot;any other game&quot; as an all-inclusive term but that it was used in its original meaning limited by its particular context. The scope of the statute in prohibiting gambling games in any and all forms clearly excluded athletic contests or those in which the contestants pit their physical or mental skills, or both, against each other as the primary object. The court also determined that the game defendant was convicted of playing was a gambling game within the purview of the statute because the game machines were designed to play one part of the public against another part for the purpose of inducing the whole public to take the chance of gain. The court finally held that, in view of the intention of the legislature to prohibit all forms of gambling, coupled with the court's endeavor to give meaning and force to its gambling statutes, no basis could have been given for supporting defendant's contention that &sect; 288-4 was so vague, indefinite and uncertain as to deprive her of her constitutional rights of due process.</SPAN></P>

Laws Haw. &sect; 118 et seq. (1955). The taxpayer argued that the Law violated the Commerce Clause under U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As a retailer, the taxpayer was required to pay taxes under the Law for merchandise acquired from sellers outside the territory who had representatives within the territory. The taxpayer was not required to pay taxes for goods acquired from wholesalers and manufacturers, who were licensed under the General Excise Tax Law, Rev. Laws. Haw. &sect; 117 et seq. (1955), and with respect to sellers outside the territory, who did not have representatives in the territory. The court affirmed the assessments. The compensating tax was imposed upon merchandise that was added to a retailer's stock and already out of the stream of commerce. The Law did not discriminate against interstate commerce and equalized the competitive advantage that outside sellers with representatives had over local sellers. The fact that the tax was not imposed upon unlicensed sellers outside the territory who did not have representatives was not unconstitutional because the discrimination was within interstate commerce. The tax did not expose interstate commerce to the risk of multiple state tax burdens because the tax was on a local incident of ownership, which was not subject to repetition in other states.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff producer appealed from an order of the Circuit Court First Circuit (Hawaii), which dismissed its complaint filed under the Hawaii Fair Trade Act (Act), Rev. Laws Haw. ch. 205, to enjoin defendant retailer from selling the producer's trade-marked products at less that the fair-trade price fixed by the producer. The circuit court found that the Act was contrary to &sect; 3 of the federal Sherman Antitrust Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to the Act, the producer sought to enjoin the retailer from selling the producer's trade-marked products at less than the fair-trade price fixed by the producer. The circuit court found that the Act was contrary to &sect; 3 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and that neither the Miller-Tydings Amendment (1937) nor the McGuire Act (1952) validated the Act. The circuit court also found that the Act made only those contracts in privity enforceable, and dismissed the complaint. The court reversed on appeal, and held that the Act was valid and a rightful subject of legislation within the provisions of &sect; 55 of the Hawaii Organic Act. There were no inconsistencies with the Sherman Antitrust Act, and the Act was not contrary to the Due Process Clause. The circuit court's holding that the enforcement of rights against unfair competition depended upon privity of contract was without merit. Price restriction was binding upon a retailer who had full knowledge of an existing price restriction imposed by contract between the producer and other retailers. Privity of contract was not necessary. The Territory of Hawaii's legislature had just as much power as any other state to pass the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The retirement system brought an action against the administratrix and the brother of the deceased employee to determine who was entitled to benefits payable by the retirement system on account of the death of the employee. The administratrix was the widow of the decedent. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the widow. On appeal, the brother contended that 1951 Hawaii Sess. Laws 156 (Act 156), was prospective in both language and operation and that if the construction of trial court that gave the statute retrospective operation was adopted, then the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that: (1) the statute did not take away or impair any vested rights acquired under the existing Employees' Retirement System Act; (2) the employee's designation of his brother as beneficiary was revoked by the subsequent marriage of the deceased; and (3) because no other beneficiary had been designated subsequent to such marriage, the death benefits went to the estate of the deceased.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The labor commission challenged a tax appeals court judgment that affirmed the review board's decision in favor of a corporate taxpayer. The taxpayer had contested a tax assessment for additional unemployment compensation contributions due on unreported commissions paid to its distributors. The taxpayer took the position that the distributors were not in its employment because the concept of employment in employment security laws was premised upon the existence of the common-law relationship of master and servant and the distributors were not its employees but independent contractors. The court reversed the tax appeals court judgment. The court held that in enacting and amending Rev. Laws. Haw. &sect; 4207 (1945), the legislature specifically rejected standards that restricted it exclusively to workers sustaining a master-servant relationship. The court found that under &sect; 4207 the taxpayer was required, but failed, to show that the distributors were free from control or direction in the performance of their services and that they were customarily engaged in independently established trade or business of the same nature as that involved in their contract of service with the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, widow and minor children of employee, challenged the judgment from the First Circuit Court (Hawaii), which sustained appellee employer's motion to dismiss the widow's complaint purporting to be an action for wrongful death under the common law of Hawaii, after the court held that the complaint failed to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court sustained the judgment of the trial court dismissing the complaint after holding that the Hawaii Workmen's Compensation Act (Act), repealed the rights of the widow and dependents of the employee as against the employer. First, the court addressed the issue of whether the widow and children had a common-law right of action for the wrongful death of the husband and father at Hawaiian common law and held that reason and natural justice were clearly in favor of permitting an action to be maintained. However, the court next looked to whether such a right had been repealed by the language of Haw. Rev. Laws &sect; 4406 (1945), and concluded that the Act cut off all common-law remedies that a wife might have had against the employer of the husband after an accident. The court stated that the history of the Act showed that the purpose was to substitute a definite compensation for accidental injury occurring with or without fault to the employee instead of the uncertainty of litigation. Likewise, the Act gave the employer a certain definite liability regardless of his negligence or lack of negligence.</SPAN></P>

The broadcasters paid the tax and thereafter brought an action for refund. The broadcasters claimed a refund on the ground that it was derived from income produced through interstate commerce. The court held that the sphere of actual commercial value was the criterion for determining whether broadcasting was intrastate or interstate. It was within the scope of the commerce clause and the scope of exercised federal power. Assessment of the territory's gross income tax was rightful and valid upon receipts of local station from local business. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The petition also sought to forbid the judge and commissioner from further proceedings in that action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers brought an action against the commissioner to recover excise taxes which had been paid under protest, contending that Rev. Laws Haw. &sect; 5455-D (1945) was unconstitutional. After issue was joined, the taxpayers sought a stay in the circuit court pending appeal from a federal judgment which had dismissed an action raising the same issues. The circuit judge denied the stay and the taxpayers brought the instant petition seeking a writ of prohibition. The court denied the writ, holding that the allegations of the petition were not sufficient to warrant the granting of the writ. Additionally, the court noted that the circuit court had jurisdiction over the matter and could legally resolve the issues. The stay sought by the writ was substantially the same as the stay sought in the circuit court, which had been denied. The court concluded that the petition was tantamount to an interlocutory appeal from the denial of the prior stay request. The petition failed to contend that the circuit judge had acted outside of his judicial discretion, that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction, nor did it seek preventive relief. Accordingly, no relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant licensees sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court, First Circuit (Hawaii), which, although it stayed a portion of the decree dissolving the temporary injunctions pending appeal, dismissed their bills challenging enforcement by respondent city police chief of a penal statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The licensees sought to enjoin the chief of police from enforcing a code that made it unlawful for any person who was not a licensee of the liquor commission to promote, encourage, aid, or permit the consumption of liquor on their premises except during certain designated hours. The licensees claimed that enforcement would result in the loss of substantial amounts of income. The trial court determined that the bills were without merit but stayed the temporary injunctions pending appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed the decree except to the extent it resulted in continuance of the ex parte restraining orders throughout the proceedings below and during the process of appeal. There were no alleged facts reasonably tending to show urgent necessity why ex parte restraining orders should have issued at the time of filing before the propriety of issuing the temporary injunctions could have been determined. The licensees failed to show any appreciable injury would have been suffered if such relief were delayed so that a hearing on orders to show cause could have been held. Also, the allegations of irreparable damage were pure conclusions of law and did not justify injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed that portion of the decree dissolving the restraining orders and temporary injunctions, and affirmed that portion that denied the prayers for permanent injunction and dismissing the bills for injunction is affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged an order of the District Court of the First Circuit, Waianae Division (Hawaii), enjoining him from harassing appellees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees alleged several incidents of harassment against appellant (their next door neighbor) at the trial court to secure an injunction against him under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 604-10.5(a)(1). Appellant challenged this section of the statute on constitutional grounds, alleging that the lack of a state-of-mind requirement under this subsection violated due process because it transformed the &quot;offense&quot; into a strict liability offense. This argument failed because it applied a criminal analysis to a civil proceeding. Because another subsection had an intent element, appellant alleged an equal protection violation. Intentional harassers versus unintentional harassers was not a suspect classification; therefore, the mandatory requirement for injunctions against intentional harassers only provided the rational basis for the constitutionality of the statute. The statute also did not infringe on constitutionally protected activity, such as self-defense or the right to freedom of movement under U.S. Const. amend. V or Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the injunction because the harassment statute did not violate due process for its strict liability quality, did not violate equal protection by classifying intentional harassers as opposed to non-intentional harassers (a mandatory injunction against intentional harassers provided a rational basis), and did not infringe on a constitutionally protected activity.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court was correct in ruling that the determination of constructive notice was one for the jury and not for the court on summary judgment. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to include the restaurant on the special verdict form for apportionment of liability, dismissing the restaurant from the action, and excluding from the trial evidence of the restaurant's negligence. On all three points, defendant relied on its status as a joint tortfeasor with the restaurant. The court found that the trial court was justified in dismissing restaurant from the action, because defendant failed to file a crossclaim against restaurant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs owned a leasehold interest in a parcel of real property adjacent to defendant corporation's leasehold interest. Both parties had purchased their longterm leasehold interests from a common landowner. For many years, the common driveway between the properties was used to access both properties.

Defendants demolished the existing structures on their parcel, and began construction on a new residence, including a new retaining wall bisecting the common driveway. Plaintiffs sued, claiming violations of their prescriptive rights. The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed. Because the dominant and servient estates were not separated until 1986, plaintiffs had not satisfied the 20-year prescriptive period of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 669-1(b).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to drug offenses and appealed the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence. Defendant claimed that drug pipes in his pockets should have been suppressed because police found them after they illegally ordered defendant to exit his car and frisked him and because there was insufficient evidence that the pipes would inevitably have been discovered. Appellate court affirmed, holding that the police had reasonable suspicion, based on complainant's allegations, that defendant committed trespass and fourth degree theft. Fourth degree theft was a misdemeanor under Haw. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 701-107 (Michie 1993 &amp; Supp. 1998), so police were permitted to order defendant to exit his car, cite him for the offenses, and conduct an outstanding warrant check to determine whether defendant qualified for citation arrest. Police determined from the check and from defendant's own admission that defendant had outstanding warrants and qualified for citation arrest. Because an inventory search would have been performed pursuant to the arrest, the pipes would inevitably have been discovered.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant security guards filed an interlocutory appeal from the order of the First Circuit Court (Hawai'i), denying their motions to dismiss charges filed by the State claiming they violated Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 852-1 (1993) for refusal to provide ingress or egress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Security guards for a hospital in Honolulu, Hawai'i began picketing at the entrance to the hospital after a discontinuation in labor negotiations between the security guards and the hospital. They were charged with violating Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 852-1 (1993), which prohibited the obstruction of ingress to or egress from any public or private place. Upon their motion, the trial refused to dismiss the State's indictment. On review, the appellate court rejected the security guards' argument that the statute was unconstitutionally vague on its face. Section 852-1 gave a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand it was unlawful to refuse or wilfully fail to move as directed by a police or other peace officer. Furthermore, application of &sect; 852-1 was not preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. However, the appellate court could not determine whether the defense of entrapment was established so as to justify dismissal of the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was sentenced and convicted for first degree robbery and assault. Petitioner was paroled, but the parole was revoked when petitioner was charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Petitioner appealed the revocation of parole contending the Hawaii paroling authority (HPA) improperly revoked petitioner's parole by not providing a parole revocation hearing pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 706-670(7). However, the HPA relied on Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 353-66 that provided an exception in holding a hearing and thus revoked petitioner's parole without a hearing. Petitioner contended his due process rights were violated when the HPA revoked his parole without affording him a hearing. The reviewing court stated a parolee was not entitled to a final parole revocation hearing if his or her parole was required to be revoked upon conviction and imprisonment while on parole. However, because the HPA was not mandated to revoke petitioner's parole upon his conviction and sentence to imprisonment for a crime committed while on parole, the court concluded the HPA should have provided petitioner with a final revocation hearing before revoking his parole. The case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant assisted by co-defendant climbed the fence of a wiring service and stole two metal telephone poles and electrical wiring intending to recycle them for cash. A police officer witnessed defendant committing the theft. Defendant and co-defendant were detained and arrested. They were charged with theft in the second-degree pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 708-831(1)(b). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss for violation of discovery order arguing that the state had not preserved the evidence because the wires and poles had been tampered with. The trial court denied the dismissal motion. Defendant was convicted of second-degree theft and sentenced to five years of probation and seven months in jail. Defendant argued that the trial court's jury instruction was improper concerning the prima facie evidence regarding the value of the property. The appellate court vacated the judgment and remanded action for a new trial because the instruction failed to inform the jury as to the state's burden of negativing the valuation defense, thus violating defendant's right to due process of law under Haw.

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence and convicting defendant for NRP and DUI. The court held that the officer's suspicion that defendant's vehicle had been reconstructed without a valid permit was not a reasonable suspicion justifying the detention/seizure of defendant. For example, the court first held that the officer had no evidence or information of defendant's operation of the vehicle. Secondly, the court determined that the county in question did not require the posting of anything on a vehicle to show that it was covered by a reconstruction permit and that the officer had no evidence or information that defendant's vehicle was not covered by a valid reconstruction permit. Accordingly, the court concluded that the evidence of the NRP and the DUI was illegally obtained as a result of an unconstitutional detention/seizure. Thus, the motion to suppress evidence should have been granted by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court granted the summary judgment on the potential employee's claim of intentional interference with prospective contract relations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff potential employee brought an action against defendant laboratory employees for intentional interference with prospective contractual relations after a laboratory employee contacted the potential employer and told it of an incident between the potential employee and another laboratory employee.

The court held that a plaintiff alleging the tort of intentional interference with prospective contractual relations must plead and prove: (1) a prospective contractual relationship existed between the plaintiff and a third party; (2) the defendant knew of this relationship; (3) the defendant intentionally interfered with the relationship; (4) the defendant acted without proper justification; (5) the defendant's interference caused the third party to fail to consummate the prospective contract with the plaintiff; and (6) the defendant's interference caused damages to the plaintiff.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The offense arose from an incident where a pretrial detainee in a correctional center engaged in fellatio with defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court found no error in the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment. The court held that an imprisoned person's consent to sexual penetration by an employee of a state correctional facility was ineffective under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 702-235, and thus was not a defense to the offense of sexual assault in the second degree. It was stated that an imprisoned person's consent was deemed improvident and hence was prevented by Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-731(1)(c). The court further held that the offense as defined by &sect; 707-731(1)(c) was not unconstitutionally vague. The court concluded that the phrase &quot;subject to sexual penetration&quot; under &sect; 707-731(1)(c) was sufficiently definite to afford a person the reasonable opportunity to ascertain what was prohibited. It was stated that defendant's action of knowingly exposing the pretrial detainee to fellatio came within the ambit of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant commercial property owner challenged the order of the First Circuit Court (Hawaii), which denied for lack of jurisdiction, appellant's challenge of a Zoning Board of Appeals of the City and County of Honolulu which in turn denied appellant's challenge of a notice by the County Department of Land Utilization requiring appellant to remove a masonry storage addition allegedly constructed in violation of a county land use ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that appellees failed to prove the date on which the order was mailed to appellant, and measured the timeliness of appellant's petition by the date of the delivery of the order. Because the appeal of the order was filed exactly 30 days after delivery of the order as required by Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 91-14(b) and Haw. R. Civ. P. 5(b), the court ruled that the appeal was timely and that the circuit court erred in denying the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Appellant argued that the masonry addition was grandfathered in as a legal nonconforming structure under the ordinance. The court held that the terms &quot;lawful use&quot; and &quot;previously lawful,&quot; as used in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 46-4 and the land use ordinance definitions of nonconforming structure and use, referred to lawful compliance with previous zoning laws, rather than to building codes. Because the addition was lawful under the comprehensive zoning code and the code did not govern the acquisition of building permits, appellant was not required to produce a building permit in order to establish that the addition was grandfathered in as a nonconforming structure under the subsequently enacted ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After plaintiff and defendant separated, plaintiff obtained a domestic abuse temporary restraining order against defendant. Subsequent, she also obtained a protective order from the trial court which barred defendant's contact with her. On appeal of the protective order, the court affirmed. The trial court properly applied the preponderance of evidence standard of proof under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 571-14(8), 571-42. The standard did not violate defendant's equal protection rights because the legislature had a legitimate reason for adopting a different standard of proof for domestic abuse cases than harassment cases, given the greater and more imminent risk of physical harm in domestic abuse cases. Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 586 did not unreasonably infringe on defendant's freedom of movement because its three-year time period was reasonable in light of the legislature's finding that women who had restraining orders issued continued to be harassed or threatened by their abusers for several years. The protective order was limited to contact of a personal nature and to definite and compact physical areas.</SPAN></P>

Although not contested by defendant, the court noted that the state failed to introduce the judgment of defendant's prior felony conviction as proof that defendant was a felon at the time he allegedly possessed a firearm and ammunition. Instead, the state introduced the testimony of defendant's probation officer to the effect that defendant was a convicted felon. The court ruled that in the absence of evidence showing its unavailability the state was required to submit the judgment of conviction itself, or a properly authenticated copy thereof, to establish the material element of defendant's prior felony conviction.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 709-906 (1992).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of violating Haw. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 709-906 (1992). On review, defendant asserted that: (1) hearsay evidence was improperly admitted; (2) his right to confront witnesses against him was violated; (3) there was insufficient evidence to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; and (4) the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court remanded the case to determine whether defendant had been advised of his right to return to the residence under police escort to retrieve clothing during the cooling-off period. The court held that: (1) testimony of the police officers was not hearsay since the statutory violation depended on the reasonableness of the police order; (2) the police officer rather than the underlying complainant was the witness to be confronted; (3) there was sufficient evidence to establish that the underlying complainant had been harmed to a degree that the police officer was justified in issuing the order and defendant had demonstrated violent propensities when he was arrested; and (4) the statute was not overbroad or vague because it clearly defined the prohibited conduct and was not subject to abuse by law enforcement.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 291C-112 improperly deprived him of the right to use his privately owned vehicle in the manner he chose. However, the court held that the state could exercise it police power in order to facilitate public safety and order. The court also held that absent any overriding specific constitutional claim, the state could, under &sect; 291C-112, properly prohibited persons from using vehicles parked on public property as dwelling places during the hours of 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Because &sect; 291C-112 rationally furthered legitimate state interests, it did not infringe on any claimed right to work or deny defendant equal protection of laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court concluded that the circuit court was wrong when it failed to order sua sponte, on the third day of trial, a hearing on defendant's competence to proceed to trial. Defendant's assertion that he had missed his morning appointment to take his regular prolixin shot, as well as his trial counsel's representation that defendant was acting completely differently from the first day of trial, when juxtaposed against prior psychiatric reports that defendant posed no risk to others as long as he saw his psychiatrist regularly, avoided substance abuse, and continued his medication, clearly raised a good faith doubt as to whether defendant's failure to take his medication was affecting his legal competence to proceed to trial. A competency hearing was thus required. Because the circuit court failed to conduct the necessary hearing, the court vacated defendant's conviction and remanded for a new hearing on defendant's present competency, and a new trial, if defendant was determined to be competent to proceed to trial.</SPAN></P>

He stopped defendant and asked for his driver's license, proof of insurance, and registration. Defendant told the officer that he had lost his wallet and that the car was rented by a friend. The officer verified that defendant had a valid driver's license and that the car was rented. The officer ordered defendant out of the car because he was not permitted by the contract to operate the car and he had no driver's license, insurance card, or registration for the vehicle in his possession. As defendant exited the vehicle, the officer saw two plastic bags containing methamphetamine. Other drug paraphernalia was recovered from the vehicle. Defendant's motion to suppress the evidence against him was denied; he was convicted. On appeal, defendant argued that the motion to suppress was improperly denied. The court agreed. For an officer to order a driver out of a vehicle, the officer had to have a reasonable basis of specific articulable facts to believe that a crime had been committed. As the officer was mandated to issue a citation rather than take defendant into custody, defendant's removal from the car was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first degree burglary and two counts of first degree terroristic threatening. On appeal, he contended, inter alia, that the trial court improperly excluded crucial defense evidence to sanction him for violation of the discovery rules. Defendant identified the gun-like cigarette lighter as a key-chain. The court found that such characterization of a crucial piece of evidence was disingenuous, but held that the trial court abused its discretion when it sanctioned him for violating discovery rules by excluding the cigarette lighter from evidence. Any actual prejudice to the prosecution caused by defendant's violation was minimal, especially because a prosecution witness had told the deputy prosecuting attorney that the object used to terrorize the victim was not a real gun. Any prejudice could have been cured by measures less severe than the exclusion of the evidence. The conviction for terroristic threatening was reversed. Because the use of a dangerous weapon was not a material element of the burglary offense the conviction for burglary was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant became nervous and, when an officer stepped in front of him and questioned him, eventually asking for his bag, defendant gave it to them. Defendant was allowed to walk away and observed placing something in bushes and, based upon that observation, defendant was forcibly arrested. It was also determined there were drugs in the bag. The trial court found, and the court agreed, that the stop and seizure of defendant's bag were invalid. At the time the officer stepped in front of defendant, he did not have the necessary grounds for an investigatory stop as there were no specific facts that would warrant a prudent and cautious person to believe defendant engaged in criminal activity. As defendant was given a reasonable ground to believe that he was not free to leave, there was no consent to searching defendant's bag though he gave it to officers. As the stop was improper, the resulting evidence should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to sustain her conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At 3:45 p.m. in a commercial area, an officer saw defendant walking across a four-lane road to speak to a man stopped in a vehicle. The officer told defendant to get out of the street. When defendant responded with an obscenity and failed to produce identification, the officer arrested her. Observing that defendant's yelling caused a traffic jam, the officer told her to keep it down or she would be arrested for disorderly conduct. Defendant continued to make noise. On appeal, the court held that to be guilty of disorderly conduct, unreasonable noise, the State had to show that defendant failed to heed the officer's admonition and that she thereby created a risk causing a member of the public to be inconvenienced. Section 711-1101(2) implicitly required that the officer's decision that the noise was unreasonable be supported by his objectively reasonable finding that the noise was a gross deviation from the standard of conduct of a law-abiding citizen. Given the time of day and the location, the officer's decision to admonish defendant was not supported by an objectively reasonable finding that her yelling was a gross deviation from the standard of conduct of a law-abiding citizen.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court held that the officers' failure to demand entry was of no consequence because by knocking and announcing, they indicated a demand to enter. On appeal, the court held that under the express terms of &sect; 803-37, three steps were required before an officer could forcibly enter: the officer had to state his office, state his business, and demand entrance. Because the officers failed to demand entrance, the search was illegal. To the extent that &sect; 803-37 authorized the police to forcibly enter if the occupants did not &quot;immediately&quot; open the door, it was unconstitutional. Under &sect; 803-37, the occupants had to be given a reasonable time in which to respond to a demand for entry.</SPAN></P>

It held that the evidence was sufficient to prove distribution, and it was not necessary to introduce the drug itself into evidence. An undercover officer testified that defendant had agreed to sell him cocaine, that he was familiar with cocaine, and that the substances defendant delivered to him on four occasions appeared to be cocaine or cocaine resin. The trial court did not err in admitting into evidence a photographic lineup that was exhibited to the undercover officer in an out-of-court identification of defendant. The police officer who compiled the photographic array and showed it to the undercover officer identified the exhibit at trial and testified that the photographs were in the same order as when the undercover officer saw them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was fined $ 25 for each of the offenses. He contended that the trial court unlawfully denied him his constitutional right to a jury trial. Based upon Hawaii's Constitution, the court agreed and thus vacated the judgment and remanded the case for jury trial. The court found that, according to the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, the accused in a criminal trial was entitled to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury. Article 1, &sect; 14, of the Hawaii Constitution was similarly worded. The court found that the proceeding was a &quot;criminal prosecution&quot; so as to afford defendant the right to a trial by jury because the penalties authorized by HRS &sect; 266-25 were criminal penalties for a penal offense. Penalties for conviction of a violation were not necessarily civil rather than criminal. The court also found that it agreed with those authorities that held that it was not required to follow the holding that, to constitute a serious crime that would warrant a right to a jury trial, the fine had to be $ 500 or more and the imprisonment had to be more than sixth months.</SPAN></P>

He argued that the presumption created under Hawaii Revised Statutes &sect; 291C-31(c), which provided that whenever traffic-control devices were placed in a position approximately conforming to law, such devices were to be presumed to have been so placed by the official act or direction of lawful authority unless the contrary was shown, unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to him. On appeal, the court held that defendant was clearly charged with violating a state statute and was not misled or prejudiced by the charge in any way. The presumption under &sect; 291C-31(c) was the legislature's recognition of the common experience that when an official traffic control device was in a legally proper place on a road, it was placed there by a properly-authorized official. The presumption was not unconstitutional because the presumed fact more likely than not flowed from the proven fact.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused and convicted of stealing from a patient. Several charges were made against him that were consolidated on the State's motion. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss all three cases contending that his rights to a speedy trial had been violated. The trial court denied the motion and granted a motion of the State for a continuance but found that the period between the motion and the continuance would not be excluded from speedy trial calculations under Rule 48, HRPP (Hawaii). Another speedy trial motion was filed and one charge was dismissed leaving two others. After his conviction, defendant raised the speedy trial issue arguing that the trial court's finding that there had been a delay of more than 6 months from the filing of the complaint against him to the date of trial required dismissal under Rule 48(b)(1). The court found that all of the acts of theft did not arise from the same actions but rather two series of actions and it had not been 6 months since the series for which the remaining charges occurred. The court also found defendant's constitutional speedy trial rights were not violated as he did not show actual prejudice from the reasonable delay.</SPAN></P>

The objectors requested that a mediation be conducted. After the mediation was completed, the commission approved the permit and the objectors sought review. The court affirmed the commission's decision and found that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 205-5.1(g) provided that the commission's decision was not a contested case. The court found that this did not violate the objectors' due process rights because a contested case hearing was not essential to the guarantee of due process. The procedures outlined in &sect; 205-5.1 were sufficient to protect the objectors' property from erroneous deprivation. The court determined that the hearing procedures did not violate due process because the objectors were afforded an opportunity to speak and to present evidence. Finally, the court determined that the record supported the commission's decision to approve the permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant parents challenged a judgment from the Family Court of the First Circuit (Hawaii), which terminated the parties' parental rights to their son after the State of Hawaii Department of Human Services (DHS) initiated proceedings under the Child Protective Act. The trial court approved a &quot;Stipulation Establishing Jurisdiction and Awarding Family Supervision&quot; and granted a &quot;Petition for Forfeiture and Termination of Parental Rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the parents' rights were terminated, the family court denied the parents' motion for reconsideration. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the family court after finding no error with the family court's judgment. In pertinent part, the court rejected the parents' argument that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571-54 (1985) entitled the parents to a hearing before the family court could deny their motions for reconsideration. Instead, the court noted that the case was based on &sect; 571-11(5), which provided that the family court would have exclusive original jurisdiction in proceedings for the termination of parental rights under &sect;&sect; 571-61 to 571-63. In addition, the court rejected the parents' argument that under both the state and federal constitutions, &sect; 571-61(b)(1)(E) (1985) was unconstitutionally vague on its face. Specifically, the court rejected the argument that the statute's language was vague where it stated that the family court could terminate rights of parents found unable to provide in the &quot;foreseeable future&quot; for their children. Rather, the court held that the term meant three years from the filing date of the petition for termination of parental rights.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment that convicted defendant of terroristic threatening in the second degree and one count of possession of a firearm. The record contained sufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant was guilty of terroristic threatening without a dangerous weapon. Even though the employees did not hear defendant's threats, actual terrorization was not a material element of second-degree terroristic threatening. Defendant uttered his threats in reckless disregard of the risk of terrorizing the employees because the risk that his conduct would terrorize the employees was &quot;substantial and unjustifiable&quot; as was required by Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 702-206(3)(a). Defendant's motion to suppress the handgun that was discovered after an officer asked him to exist his car was properly denied.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 584-14(b) and (c) did not permit the besmirching of the mother's character in the name of non-access or impeachment regarding the possibility of her having had sex with other men. The court found that the trial court properly denied the motion to have the mother's diaries analyzed by handwriting experts as the mother was cross-examined regarding the diaries and acknowledged that she sometimes made entries in her diary after the day on which the recorded event occurred. The court found that the child support award was excessive because an award for child support should be for the child's needs based on the child's appropriate standard of living and not for the purpose of saving portions thereof for future needs.

R. Civ. P. 54(b) to finalize a prior order for attorney's fees imposed for discovery abuse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A manufacturer was in the business of making nut leis and it sought a preliminary injunction against the sellers, alleging that the sellers were selling non-authentic nut leis. Before trial, the manufacturer was sanctioned for discovery abuses and ordered to pay the seller's attorney's fees and costs. The manufacturer sought to have the sanction order finalized for appeal purposes under Haw. R. Civ. P. 54(b). At the hearing, the sellers made an oral motion for attorney's fees for opposing the motion. The trial court denied the manufacturer's motion and granted the seller's motion. The court reversed the trial court's order awarding attorney's fees to the sellers for opposing the motion. The court held that the trial court lacked the inherent power to impose such a judgment as a sanction and abused its discretion by doing so. Neither Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 603-21.9(6) (1976) nor any other statute authorized such imposition. The court held that the statute was just a legislative restatement of the inherent powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court found that defendant's use of marijuana was not an essential part of his religion. The court found that the role of marijuana in defendant's religion was optional and that followers could freely practice their religion without marijuana. The court found that defendant's credibility was reduced because on the two occasions when he was arrested for smoking marijuana, he was smoking with others who were not of the same faith. The court found that because the state's prohibition on the use of marijuana did not burden the free exercise of defendant's religion, it was not necessary to address the question of whether the state had a compelling interest in proscribing the possession and use of marijuana which overrode defendant's claimed religious interest.</SPAN></P>

The trial court enjoined the landowners from renting any portion of their homes and subsequently found them in contempt for violating the injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that: (1) the complaining parties met their burden of proving the meaning of the term &quot;single family&quot; in the restrictive covenants; (2) the evidence was clear and unrebutted that the meaning of restrictive covenant was such as to prohibit the landowners' rentals; (3) the facts in the case did not support the proposition that the rentals were merely incidental to the use of the properties as single-family residences; but (4) the complaining parties were not entitled to recover attorney's fees under the covenants where they were not the &quot;seller&quot; of the properties in question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state appealed the judgment of the First Circuit Court (Hawaii) setting aside its sentence of an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 20 years, instead placing defendant on probation for five years. Defendant cross-appealed the trial court's decision that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-659 (1976) was not unconstitutional per se.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that after the sentence was imposed, defendant could have appealed within 10 days of the entry of the judgment on May 1, under Haw. R. Penal P. 37(c). Defendant chose not to do so. Instead, on May 29 he filed his Haw. R. Penal P. 40 motion and did not file his notice of appeal until September 23. While the court recognized some liberality in the time requirements of Rule 37(c), the court held that the limits had been exceeded in this case. Consequently, the court held that defendant's appeal of the April 30 and the May 1 judgment was untimely. His appeal of the September 15 judgment was timely, but the point specified in his opening brief was not urged in his motion under Rule 40. Consequently, defendant did not properly preserve his contention that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-659 was unconstitutional. In addition, the court determined that the trial court erred in deciding that defendant's original sentence violated defendant's constitutional right to be free from cruel and/or unusual punishment. Accordingly, the court reversed the later judgment and ordered the reinstatement of the original judgment and remanded for issuance of the mittimus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the City and County of Honolulu and an officer, sought review from a judgment of the First Circuit Court (Hawaii), which awarded appellee victim general damages against the city and the county and punitive damages against the officer, in a police brutality case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lawsuit arose out of an incident occurring with the victim and six friends who were gathered in a parking lot. After a verbal exchange, the officer proceeded to beat the victim about the head and face with a two-foot long metal flashlight. The jury returned a verdict against the city and the county for general damages and against the officer for punitive damages. The court found that at the time the officer beat the victim with his flashlight, he knew nothing of the existence of a gun and of marijuana in the victim's car. The introduction of this evidence did not bolster his credibility as to his state of mind in administering the beating. However, the court found no evidence from which the jury could have found that it was reasonably probable that as a direct result of the occurrence, the victim was prevented from pursuing a football career. The giving of a certain instruction was error and the city's motion for a new trial should have been granted with respect to general damages. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment as to the officer and as to liability of the city and the county and reversed, and remanded for a new trial on the issue of general damages only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from an order from the First Circuit Court (Hawaii) denying the return of property seized by police pursuant to a search warrant after two and a half years even though the evidence had been suppressed, the charge dropped, and all the property except &quot;contraband&quot; ordered returned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police, pursuant to a search warrant specifically listing five items, seized more than 100 items. Defendant was charged with theft, but his motion to suppress statements made and all evidence obtained was granted. Further, the charge was dropped. Thus, defendant filed for an order to return the seized property. The trial court ordered all non-contraband items returned, and the order was not appealed. Yet, the police claimed that all the items were contraband and refused to release them. Defendant filed for an adjudication of his property rights under the already existing order. The trial court ordered the return of four specific items, which it found were the property of defendant's parents, but denied release of the rest. Defendant appealed. On review, the court held that because the evidence in question had previously been suppressed, a prima facie showing was made that defendant was legally entitled to possession of his property. Thereafter, the government had the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the illegally seized evidence was contraband. In reversing and remanding, the court found that the state had not met that burden.</SPAN></P>
