Acts ch. 160, &sect; 7, the landowners' predecessors waived the right to protest an annexation when they signed the sewer service agreements. The trial court was to permit the annexation to take place if the conditions listed in Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-702 (1963) were demonstrated. Because the parties stipulated to the necessary conditions, the trial court did not err in not holding an evidentiary hearing on those conditions. The agreement executed by the predecessors was valid and binding even though the right to protest an annexation may not have been available at the time. The sewer service agreements did not have to be recorded pursuant to Tenn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-4272 to be valid. 1953 Ind. Acts ch. 160, &sect; 7 related to future annexations. Because the statute applied to everyone, there was no valid equal protection argument.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to their divorce decree, in which the parties' settlement agreement was incorporated, the ex-husband was ordered to pay alimony and child support. Following the divorce, the ex-husband moved to Indiana. When he fell behind in his alimony payments, the ex-wife brought this action. The ex-husband contended that he failed to pay alimony only after the ex-wife breached her duties under the settlement agreement regarding visitation. He further argued that the decree was unenforceable because Indiana law did not provide for alimony. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the ex-wife. The court held that the ex-wife was entitled to have the decree enforced under U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1. The court refused to deny full faith and credit to the decree. The court rejected the ex-husband's argument that the ex-wife's complaint failed to state a claim because it did not allege performance by her of all conditions required by the parties' settlement agreement. The court held that the state's notice pleading rules did not require such a pleading construction as contended by the ex-husband.</SPAN></P>

After the latter divorced and the biological father and mother married, the biological father brought a declaratory action to have himself declared the legitimate father. The legal father claimed that the action was estopped by the divorce. The court reversed and remanded the trial court's decision for the legal father, holding that there were no means for the biological father to legitimate the child. The court reasoned that &sect; 207 of the Indiana Probate Code only applied to inheritance. The declaratory action did allow the biological father to be declared the biological father. Although he could not have been the legitimate father, he had a substantial present interest to be declared the biological father. The divorce decree did not estop the biological father's action because neither the child nor the biological father was a party to the divorce action. Summary judgment as to the biological father's status as biological father was improper without proof as to the paternity test's accuracy. The case was remanded for the appointment of a guardian ad litem to represent the child.</SPAN></P>

The Department denied the taxpayer's refund request. After the taxpayer sought review of the Department's decision, the circuit court entered judgment in favor of the taxpayer and ordered a refund to the taxpayer. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that (1) under the Act, a different rate of taxes could apply to a taxpayer that segregated the sources of its income; (2) construing statutory language in its plain, ordinary, and usual sense, meat products were included within the meaning of &quot;stocks of groceries&quot; covered under the Act; and (3) the circuit court's finding that the taxpayer sold &quot;stocks of groceries&quot; was supported by substantial evidence, and it correctly concluded that the Act did not require a taxpayer to fit all of the product categories listed in the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, city residents and taxpayers, sought review of an order of the Elkhart Circuit Court (Indiana), which granted summary judgment to defendant city. The complaint for declaratory judgment challenged an annexation ordinance passed by the city. Plaintiffs contended that the trial court erred when it held it was without jurisdiction to conduct a hearing on the alleged illegality of the annexation ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the court noted that the primary issue was whether persons who were not residents or owners of land in the area to be annexed could challenge an annexation ordinance by a taxpayer's suit for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. The court held that to obtain relief under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, plaintiffs had to have standing within the purview of Ind. Code &sect; 34-4-10-2 (1971). Because the Act required a plaintiff to have a right affected by an ordinance or statute before declaratory relief could be granted, the right of a taxpayer as a personal right was insufficient to establish standing. Plaintiffs together had a right to bring an action, but their right was not unqualified. A lawsuit on behalf of the public had to involve a substantial interest or right of the public. Thus, the action could only proceed where the action of the city was clearly or patently illegal, where the city acted without jurisdiction, or where wastage of public funds was present or imminent. Because plaintiffs had made no such showing, the court held that they had not established a sufficient interest in the annexation to have standing.</SPAN></P>

The court held an individual was not precluded under the Act from acquiring 132 shares of common stock in the state bank but that if the individual acted through or on behalf of a joint venture or similar organization, the individual was precluded by the Act from acquiring the shares. The court found that the trial court improperly granted a summary judgment in favor of defendants where a material fact issue arose as to whether a joint venture existed among defendants to purchase more than 25 percent of the voting stock. The court noted that defendants admitted that a profit motive existed for the arrangement and that defendants had agreed among themselves as to a division of the stock acquired.

The controversy was a &quot;labor dispute&quot; within the meaning of the Anti-Injunction Act (Act), Ind.

On appeal, the officials challenged the denial of their motion.

On appeal, the state supreme court affirmed in part, holding that a court of concurrent jurisdiction was without jurisdiction to enter an injunction against a judge of another court. The court further held that, under the Act, no action for an injunction alone could be brought to declare the absence of the de jure existence of a newly reorganized school corporation. However, because the procedural rules allowed relating back of amended proceedings, the court reversed in part and remanded with directions to the trial court to allow the residents to so amend.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed in part, holding that the trial court had properly dismissed the action against a circuit judge for lack of jurisdiction. The court reversed the dismissal as to the remaining defendants and remanded with directions to the trial court to allow the residents to amend their complaint to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

The court also ordered the Commission to determine the developers' and all those similarly situated, rates in an amount found by the Commission to be commensurate with the utility's cost related to the extension of its services, and for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith. The court held that reasonable men would conclude that the rate charge was not just and reasonable and the utility's continuation of a collection of $ 300 for a hook-on of water and sewage lines, for lines that the utility neither paid for nor created, plus $ 6.00 inspection fee for each line, was inequitable and an abuse of discretion. When the utility argued that the Commission's order, being interlocutory, was not appealable, the court concluded that it was constrained to hold the order entered by the Commission was, in fact, a final, appealable order; therefore, the utility's motion to dismiss should be overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff state filed an action for relator municipal corporation, a city's mass transit authority, against defendant state revenue board in the Superior Court of Marion County (Indiana) that sought to enforce an Act of the state general assembly to fund the municipal corporation. Upon removal, the court upheld the validity of the Act. After the state supreme court denied a petition for review, the court granted a petition for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In a prior decision, the court held that 1967 Ind. Acts 1818, which provided for a portion of the county state inheritance taxes to fund the mass transit authority, was valid and required enforcement. Thereafter, the state General Assembly passed a law to repeal the Act, 1967 Ind. Acts 1818, retroactively. However, the court held that pursuant to the separation of governmental powers embodied in Ind. Const. art. 3, &sect; 1, the state General Assembly was without authority to interfere with the court's judgment in favor of the mass transit authority. The court further explained that because its prior judgment was against the public officers, not the individuals in office, the successors to those public offices were bound by the prior judgment where the judgment enforced ministerial, rather than discretionary, acts of the public officers. Furthermore, because the successors appeared voluntarily in the cause without raising the issue of the court's jurisdiction over them, the error, if any, was waived. Sovereign immunity provided no defense to the state officials' compliance with the court's judgment because of the court's authority to review the constitutionality of legislative acts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Upholding its prior judgment, the court ordered the state officials to draw and issue a warrant upon the general fund of the state treasury in accordance with the judgment and to deposit funds with the court for disbursement to the mass transit authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The property owner used his land as a private airport. Around the same time that the property owner started up his airport, the city passed a zoning ordinance. As result of the zoning ordinance, the property owner's land was classified as residential. Thereafter, the airport authority filed a petition to amend the master zoning plan, specifically to change the residential classification of the property owner's land to a municipal airport district. However, the city denied the airport authority's petition. Thereafter, the zoning ordinance was later amended thereby changing the property owner's classification from residential to a municipal airport district. The city then filed their action challenging the amendment to the ordinance. The property owner and the airport authority filed their motions for summary judgment. After the trial court granted the property owner's and the airport authority's motion for summary judgment, the city appealed. On appeal, the court held that under Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4-214, the city's appeal should have been taken directly to the Supreme Court of Indiana because the case involved a question regarding the constitutionality of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the record did not contain evidence of charitable acts and that the fraternal organization's activities exhibited a use of the property that was not within even the most lenient constitutional definition of charity when only three percent of its gross income was devoted to charitable contributions. The court concluded that property owned by a fraternal holding corporation for the benefit of a fraternal organization is exempt from taxation to the extent that the fraternal holding corporation is otherwise entitled to an exemption within the meaning of &sect; 64-201, supra, as interpreted by case authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commission issued an order awarding to a private utility a certificate to render combined sewer and water service to a certain area exclusively. The order was issued under the Combined Sewage Disposal and Water Act of 1963, Ind. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 55-4601 to 55-4615. The City and landowners appealed and the court reversed the order. The court found that the Act violated Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23. The court found that the Act granted privileges and immunities to private utilities rendering combined sewage disposal and water services, which it did not grant to public utilities. The purpose of the Act was purportedly to encourage sewage disposal service and water service in rural areas. However, the court found that those two services could not be combined in any way. The whole basis of the Act had no reasonable relation to the end of providing residents in rural areas with water service and sewage disposal service, and thus, it could not be justified as a legitimate exercise of the police power. Further, the classification did not include all of those who could reasonably render such services. Thus, as the classification was arbitrary, the court declared the Act unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the dissident congregation was not entitled to seize the property that belong to the parent church under either ecclesiastical law of the church or by the civil law. The dissident congregation sought a rehearing and contended that the court's prior opinion created an unconstitutional preference to a religious society and that the court's opinion vested the parent church with the power to amend, avoid, and make of no effect a statute of the State of Indiana. The court denied the petition for rehearing but reversed the judgment with directions to enter a judgment that was in conformity with the opinion. The court found that its prior language did not create a unconstitutional preference and the wording used by the court simply referred to the dissident congregation's unlawful removal of property. The original decision did not confer power upon the parent church to change the law of Indiana, it simply stated that legal tribunals were to accept questions of discipline or of faith, or ecclesiastical rule, custom, or law made by the highest of these church judicatories.</SPAN></P>

The court thereby rejected the member church's argument that since by the deed of conveyance of the real estate was to a corporation as grantee, the church law or rule was not applicable. The court then found that inasmuch as the member church became acknowledged seceders from the church organization to which they owed allegiance, they were without authority to attempt to claim ownership of this church property, which was only held in trust.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the detective agency and its employee were not required to pay fees for certain unlicensed employees who worked for the detective agency because they were employed solely as guards for industrial plants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The detective agency alleged that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42-1223(a), which established a registration fee for unlicensed employees assisting a private detective in the conduct of his business, and Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42-1208, which defined a private detective business and the right to employ unlicensed assistants, were unconstitutional as being indefinite, vague, and uncertain. Alternatively, they asserted that the statutes should be interpreted to exclude those employees not used in investigative work from the classification of unlicensed employees. Section 42-1208 provided that the furnishing of guards for hire solely to industrial plants for plant security was not considered a detective business. The court found that the trial court incorrectly construed the statutes. The court held that the words &quot;industrial plants&quot; should be narrowly construed and that the ordinary man would understand industrial plant to be any factory, business or concern which is engaged primarily in the manufacture or assembly of goods and that the evidence did not support the trial court's finding that the detective agency furnished its employes for hire solely to industrial plants for plant security.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court exercised its discretion fairly and with restraint in fixing the amount of support. The court ruled that the alleged father eliminated one possible avenue of escape by not availing himself of scientific proof.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On review, the court found that the words complained of by the worker, in the first two legal paragraphs, did not constitute defamation per se. Thus, the worker was required to allege and prove special damages in his complaint. The only specific injury alleged was an inability to attain a high union office. The worker did not allege he suffered any impairment of his employment. In the absence of injury to employment, damages could only be a matter of pure speculation. Thus, the trial court was justified in sustaining the demurrers to legal paragraphs I and II. The third legal paragraph, against the broadcasting company, alleged that the crime of slander had wrongfully been imputed to him. Although the false imputation of criminal activity could give rise to a cause of action for defamation, the worker's complaint failed to suggest the requisite clarity as the alleged broadcast never indicated whom the worker had slandered. The court also questioned the constitutionality of the common law offense of criminal libel. Because of freedom of the press, demurrer to the third legal paragraph was properly sustained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the decision to sustain the demurrers filed by the broadcasting company and its announcers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant agent sought review of a judgment of the Vanderburgh Probate Court (Indiana), which sustained appellee principal's demurrer to the agent's breach of contract action. The action alleged that the principal breached his oral agreement to pay the agent a specific sum of money and an interest in the principal's oil and gas lease if the agent would locate and secure investors for part of the lease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The agent brought an action to collect a commission for having procured investors for shares in the principal's oil and gas lease. The court affirmed the probate court's order, which sustained the principal's demurrer, and found that the agent could not collect because he failed to allege that he was a licensed real estate broker, as required by Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 63-2408. For purposes of &sect; 63-2408, the lease fell within the definition of &quot;real estate&quot; in &sect; 63-2422. As such, the agent's activity fell within the definition of a &quot;real estate broker&quot; in &sect; 63-2422. Although part performance removed the parties' oral contract from the statute of frauds, the agent could not recover a commission for the real estate transaction because he did not show that he was a licensed broker. Finally, the agent could not collect under theories of quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. In the absence of a written contract, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33-104 precluded an action to recover a commission for finding investors in the principal's real estate project. Moreover, the agent failed to allege that the principal received a benefit that amounted to unjust enrichment.</SPAN></P>

The property owners contended that the order was not in accord with due process of law. The property owners admitted that their buildings were in a dilapidated condition, in a dangerous state of repair, and were a fire hazard. However, they argued that the property could have been remedied by repairs. At that point there was some conflict in the evidence. The trial court heard the witnesses, examined the exhibits, observed the buildings, and concluded that they should have been removed. The court would not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. The court found no unlawful invasion of the constitutional rights of the property owners. The Commissioner made a fair inspection of the premises, the Board conducted a hearing, and the trial court granted a complete trial of the matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In his action for a declaratory judgment, the relator sought a determination as to whether &quot;door to door&quot; voter registration would subject the participants in the registration to prosecution under the Corrupt Practices Provisions of the Indiana Election Code, Ind.

Because the declaratory judgment action would impact all Indiana election districts, the Attorney General removed the action to the court pursuant to the Removal Act, 1965 Ind. Acts, ch. 7. The relator challenged the court's jurisdiction and the constitutionality of the Removal Act, and petitioned the court to remand the action to the trial court. The court held that it had original jurisdiction over the action to preserve an orderly and uniform enforcement of the disputed statute. The court upheld the constitutionality of the Removal Act. Because the Removal Act conferred original jurisdiction on the court for writs of prohibition, the statute that required appeals relating to the constitutionality of a statute was not applicable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee alleged that the court failed to consider other questions of error presented by appellant. The court held that the argument was untenable, as the court would not consider questions unessential to a determination of the appeal; only one prejudicial error needed to be presented for reversal. The court noted that it reversed on the error that the trial court wrongly directed the verdict of false imprisonment, and reversal on that error alone was sufficient. The court rejected appellee's contentions that the court misapplied case law for the reason that the holding in the case referred to was based upon an arrest pursuant to a statute that had been declared unconstitutional before the arrest; in appellee's case, the ordinance was declared unconstitutional after the arrest. The court held that case concerned was properly cited only for authority that proof of an arrest under an unconstitutional statute was prima facie false imprisonment; another case was properly cited for the proposition that it made no difference at which time a statute was declared unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">While the picketer was dispensing handbills in front of the drug store, the store owner had the picketer arrested and incarcerated and then signed an affidavit charging the picketer with violation of Michigan City, Ind., Ordinance No. 1390. A municipal court judge in the criminal proceeding sustained the picketer's motion to quash on the ground that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court ruled that the trial court erred in sustaining the store owner's motion for a directed verdict in the picketer's false imprisonment and malicious prosecution action. The court determined that the store owner's affidavit was void because of the unconstitutionality of the ordinance, that the facts demonstrated that the store owner caused the arrest under illegal process by procuring a policeman to imprison the picketer and by signing a void affidavit for the picketer's arrest, and that these acts constituted false imprisonment. The court also ruled that proof that the store owner caused the unlawful imprisonment was sufficient under the allegation of the complaint stating that the store owner &quot;imprisoned&quot; the picketer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant employer challenged a judgment from the Marshall Circuit Court (Indiana), which awarded appellee employee unpaid wages and expenses plus liquidated damages and attorney's fees pursuant to Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-101, 40-102 (1952) and overruled the employer's motion for a new trial. The issue was whether there was an employer-employee relationship or whether the employee was a sub-contractor or the employee of a subcontractor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parties agreed that the employee would do concrete work and lay cement block for wages and legitimate expenses. The court found substantial evidence or reasonable inferences that the employee was previously a sub-contractor, was not currently a sub-contractor because the employer had already started the job and it only had to be finished, the job site was outside the State and required considerable travel, there was no written or oral sub-contract between the parties, payment was to be on an hourly basis and there was no stated price for the entire job, the time worked by the employee was turned in to the employer, and the employer retained the right to direct and control the work. The court held there was evidence of probative value sufficient to find an employer-employee relationship. The court opined that viewing the record most favorably to the employee was insufficient to prove that the employee made a demand for specific periodic wage payments either prior to or concurrent with his employment, so the award of liquidated damages and attorney's fees was not sustained by sufficient evidence and was contrary to law, but the employee was entitled to unpaid wages and expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment awarding the employee unpaid wages and expenses on condition of remittitur of liquidated damages and attorney's fees within 30 days of affirming the judgment; otherwise the cause would be remanded with instructions to sustain the employer's motion for new trial and further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The City made no contention that it adopted or had in existence any regulatory ordinance, which was violated by the transit company. The sole contention made by the City was that the transit company's operations were unlawful because it did not procure from the City a franchise contract authorizing it to operate its motor vehicles within the city limits. This contention was not supported by any evidence that the transit company violated any statute or any duty imposed by the common law.

The employer appealed, claiming that a sales representative on a regular monthly advance against earned commissions with a guaranteed annual minimum salary was not entitled to the benefits of Ind.

The court on appeal noted that the residents raised several issues on appeal related to the trial court's overruling of the motion for a new trial, as well as other pretrial motions, the sufficiency and admission of specific evidence by the trial court, and the alleged irregularity and noncompliance in the incorporation proceedings and documents. The court found that the trial court did not commit error in overruling the disputed motions and that the required procedures had been substantially complied with. The court, however, found that those issues were not significant in view of the impact of the state legislature's adoption of Ind. Stat. Ann. ch. 17 (1961) prior to the subject appeal because that curative legislation specifically dealt with the disputed incorporation and cured any and all alleged procedural irregularities.

The trial court found that such determinants existed, including that the annexation was in the best interests of the city and of the territory. The court held that there was sufficient evidence of probative value to support the findings made by the trial court. Also, the wording of Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-701 (1950 Supp.) did not require that terms and conditions be included in the ordinance, but merely allowed it. Finally, the owners argued that the judge lacked jurisdiction because he failed to render a decision within 90 days of when the cause was submitted and an application to withdraw the submission from the judge had been filed. The court held that the case was not &quot;submitted&quot; until the parties had submitted their drafts of proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law.

The customers intervened, claiming that the rates were discriminatory. The Commission found that the proposed rate schedule was non-discriminatory, reasonable, and just within the meaning of Ind.

Acts ch. 189, &sect; 1, a final decision, ruling, or order of the Commission could be appealed. The City argued that the Commission's order was only for a year and so was not final. Half of the judges of the court determined that the appeal should be dismissed because it was from an interlocutory decree. The other half of the judges thought that the appeal should be heard because the increase in rates affected the customers' fundamental rights without due process in violation of U.S. Const. amend.

The alleged owners claimed that they were the lawful owners of part of the property claimed by the grantees. The alleged owners initiated an action. The trial court granted judgment in favor of the grantees. The alleged owners claimed that the finding of the trial court was not sustained by sufficient evidence and was contrary to law. In affirming the decision, the court found that a typographical error in the deed did not invalidate the sale or deed from the county commissioners to the grantees. The error stated that the county bid on the real estate pursuant Indiana Acts 1943, but the county actually bid on the real estate in 1942. The error was minor as it was merely a wrong recitation on a preprinted form. The alleged owners also tried to challenge the various essential steps leading up to the original tax sale to the county commissioners, but they failed to make such challenge at the trial court level. There was a presumption of regularity in the sale when the grantees introduced into evidence the deed conveying title to them.</SPAN></P>

There was no praecipe for a transcript and the transcript did not include a bill of exceptions containing the evidence. There was no assignment of errors and briefs were not filed in the circuit court. The court affirmed the dismissal of the appeal, finding that appellant did not properly perfect his appeal. First, the court determined that the action was a civil, not a criminal, action. Thus, the applicable law was Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4-2702 (1946), which provided that appeals from certain city courts, including the trial court herein, were to be taken to the circuit in the same manner as appeals were taken from judgments rendered in the circuit court to the appellate court. Section 4-2702 further provided that there was to be no trial de novo, but the circuit court was to consider and review assigned errors. Thus, because appellant had not filed any assignments of errors in the circuit court, and the circuit court had no jurisdiction to try the case de novo, appellant had not perfected his appeal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the injunction. The union and the employees appealed, claiming that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant the injunction because the National Labor Relations Act preempted the field and closed it to state regulation. The court ruled that the union had a right to strike and to engage in peaceful picketing because the employer was engaged interstate commerce. The employees were protected and expressly recognized by the Act. Thus, the trial court had no jurisdiction to act in the matter and enjoin the actions of the union and the employees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The landowners alleged error in holding that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over their original petition, which sought a writ of certiorari and injunctive relief, and in striking their amended petition to add a party defendant. On appeal, the court reversed. The Marion Circuit Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine cases of the class to which the case pleaded in the petition belonged. Because appellees filed no brief, the court considered only whether the landowners made a prima facie showing of error. The subject matter of the controversy was the Commission's alleged illegal action in recommending the proposed ordinance amending the Master Plan Zoning Ordinance by reclassifying a district from residential to business and the invalidity of the amending ordinance. Under Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 53-755 (Supp. 1957), the circuit court's jurisdiction extended to such equitable proceedings for injunctive relief. The amended petition related back to the original petition because it neither stated a new cause of action nor changed the issues presented in the original petition. Therefore, the trial court erred striking the amended petition as not timely filed.</SPAN></P>

She and the employee were married in 1944. They were divorced in 1951 but lived together continuously as husband and wife until the death of the employee in 1952. In 1953, the Morgan Circuit Court found that the decree of divorce should be set aside because the divorce was obtained by coercion and false testimony. The court was of the opinion that the decree of divorce, which was subsequently set aside, was a voidable judgment. Therefore, it was in full force and effect until set aside. Under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 40-1403 (1952), the question of total dependency should be determined as of the time of death of the employee. Thus, the court held that at the time that the employee was killed, she was not the employee's legal wife. The ex-wife next contended that she entitled to compensation as his common-law wife. The court found no evidence of a common-law marriage. Finally, the ex-wife was not entitled to compensation as a total dependent in fact because she was not related to the employee by blood or marriage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff claimant challenged the decision of the Industrial Board of Indiana, which denied her petition for benefits as a common law wife of a decedent employee of defendant corporation. The employee was fatally injured while driving one of the corporation's trucks. The claimant contended that the facts specifically found by the Board were insufficient to sustain the Board's denial of benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The claimant sought review of the Board's decision denying her workers' compensation benefits as the common law wife of a decedent employee. The claimant contended that she qualified for benefits as a dependent under Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-1402a (1952). The claimant also challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 40-1402a(a) limiting a dependent common law wife's eligibility for benefits to those individuals whose common law relationship existed for a minimal five years immediately preceding an employee's death. The court on appeal remanded the matter to the trial court based on its determination that the facts specifically found by the Board were insufficient to sustain the Board's decision. The court ruled that the Board failed to meet its duty under Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-1511 to specifically find facts upon each element essential to support an award or decision. Because the Board's decision raised no presumption as to the facts not found, the cause was required to be remanded for a determination on each of the elements necessary to support an award. The court noted that the Board's findings were insufficient to exclude every possibility of the claimant's qualification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court remanded the cause to the Board for further proceedings to determine whether the matter could be decided on other grounds not identified in the Board's prior findings of fact or must be decided upon the constitutional issue submitted by the claimant.</SPAN></P>

The corporation's demurrer to the petition was sustained. Reversing and remanding, the court concluded that it was not reversible error to allow the corporation to file multiple demurrers because the trial court had not ruled on the original demurrer and had authority to grant the withdrawal of the demurrer and permit the filing of an &quot;amended&quot; demurrer. The trial court erred by sustaining the final demurrer. The taxpayer had a right, as a taxpayer, to attack the judgment as a fraudulent official act. The corporation waived any issue as to service of notice by filing a general appearance and answer to the taxpayer's action. The taxpayer's compliant stated a good cause of action to set aside and vacate the judgment because it contained the fundamental allegation that the judgment usurped the exclusive authority of the Auditor to fix the assessment upon the omitted property and was, therefore, void ab initio to that extent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the claimant was notified by the Board that it would hear his appeal, he wrote a letter to the Board informing it that he was financially and physically unable to travel to the hearing. He further requested that the Board review the case in his absence. The Board dismissed the appeal when the claimant failed to appear at the hearing. The Board then overruled the claimant's motion to reinstate the appeal. On appeal from the Board's decisions, the court held that the Board abused its discretion under Ind. Emp. Security Div., Rev. Bd. R. &amp; Regs. 1004 by refusing to hear the case on the merits as requested by the claimant. However, the court declined to reverse the Board's order because the claimant failed to show that he was substantially harmed. The court reasoned that the claimant's brief failed to include a statement of the evidence heard by the referee, and such evidence may have shown that the claimant was not entitled to unemployment compensation.</SPAN></P>

The clerk was employed by the State and was the agent of a certain State officer. According to the clerk, he submitted hundreds of written daily reports to the firm, at the firm's request, with respect to the project. The clerk filed suit to recover for the services he provided in submitting those reports. On appeal, the court ruled that the evidence was sufficient to show the existence of both an implied contract by which the clerk was employed by the firm to perform the services and an implied promise to pay the reasonable value of the services rendered for which compensation was sought. However, the court ruled sua sponte that the implied contract contravened a positive statute, namely, Ind. Code &sect; 10-3713 (1942), and therefore it was against public policy of the state and was void. The clerk, being an agent of the State, legally could not be interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract for the construction of any public building or works of any kind, erected or built for the use of the State.</SPAN></P>

A remonstrance action was filed. The lower court found in favor of the city, holding that the territory described in the annexation ordinance was to be incorporated into the city's limits. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that no question was presented for appellate review as to the objections to questions asked of certain witnesses. That was so because the remonstrators waived their objections by failing to raise them in their motion for new trial. Nor was error committed in the exclusion of evidence regarding the annexation's effect on the city's indebtedness. The annexation created no new indebtedness on behalf of the city regardless of the amount of existing bonded indebtedness of the school corporations affected. The constitutional limit on such indebtedness was not exceeded. Thus, the remonstrators were not harmed by the striking of testimony on the issue. Finally, error was not made in finding that the boundary line ran through a residence. The voter residing in the residence was entitled to preserve or change his residence based on the new boundary.</SPAN></P>

Acts ch. 309, p. 838 because it was drafted while he was married to his first wife and before he was married to the widow, after the first wife died. The court affirmed the admission of the will to probate. The statute stated that a will was null and void that was executed by any male or female qualified to execute a will but who &quot;being unmarried, shall execute a will disposing of his or her property or any portion of the same, and who, after the execution of such will, shall become married.&quot; The will in controversy was executed before the marriage of the deceased to the widow but it was not executed before the deceased was married. The court determined that it could not say that the title to the act required a judicial construction different from the literal wording of the act which read &quot;who, being unmarried, shall execute a will.&quot; Moreover, the classification of individuals executing a will as married or unmarried was not wholly arbitrary and without reason. Furthermore, the literal interpretation was supported by a judicial interpretation of the statute before it was amended to include unmarried men.</SPAN></P>

Acts ch. 84, &sect; 1, which based the treasurer's annual salary on the population of cities in certain classes. The State conceded that pursuant to those statutes the treasurer was entitled to the salary of both the county and city treasurer, but further conceded that he could not receive from collections of personal property tax only the difference between that amount and the maximum sum of $ 10,000. The treasurers argued that the 1945 Act applied, asserting their salary as city treasurer was not contained in that limitation. The court reversed, concluding that the 1945 Act was an &quot;extra pay&quot; statute, conferring additional compensation to the treasurer for new or additional duties. However, it further found that the intention of the Act was to restrict each county treasurer to a total compensation of $ 10,000 in any one year for all services rendered because the officer of city treasurer had been abolished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant transit company challenged an order of Marshall Circuit Court (Indiana) entering judgment on a jury verdict in favor of appellee passenger for damages she suffered when a motorist ran into the bus on which the passenger was riding. The company claimed that the circuit court erred in instructing the jury on the passenger's theory of liability under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 47-2123 (1940). The motorist, also found liable, did not appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">When the motorist's car struck the rear of the bus, it was stopped at an angle that left the rear of the bus nearly 15 feet away from the curb. Though the motorist, who was found to be drunk and to be speeding, did not appeal, the company challenged the verdict on grounds, inter alia, that the jury was improperly instructed under &sect; 47-2123. The court agreed that the jury instruction was in error, and it reversed the judgment and ordered the company's new trial motion granted. In so ruling, the court found that the conduct of the driver of the bus in stopping at the curb for the purpose of taking on or discharging passengers was not &quot;parking&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 47-2123, that the bus in fact was under a charter duty to stop at the right hand curb of the streets on its route in order to serve passengers traveling to or from that location, and that the legislature did not intend &sect; 47-2123 to apply to a common carrier of passengers such as the company's bus when it was discharging duties it owed in general to the public. The court was careful to note, however, that even if &sect; 47-2123 did not apply, the bus driver still had a common law duty to exercise reasonable and ordinary care.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the order of the circuit court entering judgment on the verdict against the company and instructed the circuit court to sustain the company's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners filed a motion for summary judgment asking that the court once again declare the in-Indiana limitation unconstitutional and order respondent to refund the amounts claimed by petitioners in their refund claims. The court granted partial summary judgment in petitioners' favor regarding the constitutionality of the limitation. The court found that the limitation distorted the apportionable base and had the effect of treating motor carriers differently solely on the basis of where they chose to use their power take-off equipment.

Petitioner challenged a final determination of the State Board of Tax Commissioners (Board), which fixed the assessed value of the property. The court affirmed the Board's determination, as petitioner waived issues and presented insufficient evidence at the administrative level. Although the Board did not adhere to statutory requirements for the appointment of a hearing officer, petitioner waived the issue by failing to raise it at the administrative level. Although the Board's explanation fell short of what is typically required in explaining how it arrived at a grade of improvement, petitioner made only a de minimis factual showing on the grade issue and presented no evidence on the obsolescence issue at the administrative level relating to this error. The Board hearing officer did not have a duty to make petitioner's case. To allow a taxpayer to prevail on a cursory showing at the administrative level would tremendously increase the Board's workload. Further, the fact that the property tax system was flawed did not entitle a taxpayer to reversal of an assessment.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners were certain government bodies, certain government officials, and certain individual taxpayers; while respondents were a state board of tax commissioners, and other government officials. The court held that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the case as the case arose under the laws of the state, the exhaustion of administrative review was not a prerequisite to judicial review, and the legislature intended that all challenges to tax laws be tried in the tax court. However, governmental petitioners did not have standing, as they were unable to show a personal stake in the outcome of the suit.

The county's land valuation order provided acreage values for apartment land and commercial land. The maximum value for primary apartment land set forth in the apartment land schedule was $ 40,000 per acre, the equivalent of $ .92 per square foot. Nevertheless, the state board fixed the assessed value of the owner's land at $ 10 per square foot by applying the commercial land schedule (the only classification under the land valuation order with values that high) rather than the apartment land schedule. The property owner appealed to the county board of review, which denied the owner's claim, and the state board, which affirmed the valuation. The property owner then appealed to the court, which reversed and remanded. The court held that using the commercial land schedule to value apartment land violated the plain language of the land order. The court also held that the state board's assessment violated Ind.

The court fixed a date, after which the board was required to consider all competent real world evidence presented by persons filing appeals. If taxpayers introduced real world evidence at the administrative level, then the court would consider such evidence in any review made by it of the final determinations of the board.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners, town and associated individuals, challenged the constitutionality of Indiana's real property taxation system. The tax court upheld the system pursuant to Ind. Const. art. X, &sect; 1, that the system should be based on fair market value. On appeal, the supreme court reversed the decision of the tax court and remanded the case for a determination whether the &quot;true tax value&quot; system met the uniformity and equality required by the constitution. The court held that the property taxation system violated the constitution, which requires uniformity and equality as well as just valuation of any system of property taxation. The court determined that the system did not have an objective measure of the value of properties within and among categories of property, often based on arbitrary cost schedules. The court determined that the procedure and lack of objective standards violated the Due Course of Law (due process) provision of the Indiana Constitution, Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner taxpayer sought review of the letter of findings of respondent Department of State Revenue (Indiana), which assessed him for unpaid income tax, penalties, and interest for 1992, after the taxpayer requested a refund on his individual Indiana resident income tax return on the basis of a credit for income tax allegedly paid in the District of Columbia.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied the taxpayer's motion for summary judgment and affirmed the assessment, finding that there was no issue of material fact and that the taxpayer was not due a tax credit. The court held that a reconstructed income tax return was admissible under Ind. R. Evid. 1004. If the taxpayer was claiming a credit for income tax paid in the District of Columbia, then the department correctly ruled that he was not entitled to the credit because the District of Columbia was a reverse credit jurisdiction. Alternatively, if the taxpayer was claiming a credit for paying federal income tax, he was not due a credit because Indiana did not provide a credit for federal taxes paid. While the department failed to follow statutory procedures when it issued the warrant without responding to the taxpayer's written protests and without holding a hearing, the error was harmless. The taxpayer's challenge of the state's authority to levy the adjusted gross income tax on all sources of income earned outside the state was without merit because it was well-established that a state may tax all the income of its residents, even income earned outside the taxing jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner, a corporation in the business of selling food through vending machines, sought review of an order of the Indiana Department of State Revenue, which denied its claim for a refund of gross retail tax (sales tax) paid to the Department. The corporation brought its action because it concluded, after having paid the tax for several years, that much of the food it sold was tax exempt pursuant to Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 6-2.5-5-20(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the court reviewed the department's final determination de novo and was not bound by either the evidence or the issues raised at the administrative level. The court held that the tax refund was properly denied. The corporation was not entitled to the food for human consumption exemption as vending machines were specifically excluded under the clear and unambiguous language of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 6-2.5-5-20(c)(11). That law also did not violate either Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23 or U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. With regard to the state constitutional claim, the court held that the statute did not irrationally and arbitrarily exclude vending machine sales from the exemption because such sales did not add to the regressive nature of the sales tax. In the second part of the state constitutional analysis, it was not material how single-serving prepackaged items sold by convenience and grocery stores were taxed because they were in a class separate from vending machines. Similarly, the federal constitution did not forbid classifications. The separate classification and treatment of vending machine sales was rationally related to legitimate policies supporting the exemption statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner taxpayers, representing taxpayers who owned certain real estate and appealed their individual property assessments for a certain year, filed a class action against respondent State Board of Tax Commissioners (Indiana) challenging the constitutionality of the statutory system of real property taxation. The board determined that the assessment of real property based on its &quot;true tax value&quot; was consistent with Ind. Const. art. 10, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The board promulgated Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-31-6(c) to determine the &quot;true tax value&quot; of real property for assessment purposes. The taxpayers argued the &quot;true tax value&quot; system was inequitable because it yielded different true tax values for properties with comparable market values; therefore, it violated Ind. Const. art. 10, &sect; 1, which required a uniform and equal rate of property assessment and taxation. Further, the term &quot;just value&quot; under Ind. Const. art. 10, &sect; 1 was synonymous with market value, which was the only meaningful standard to measure equality and uniformity. The board argued the true tax value system valued real property on a basis other than market value, and the &quot;just value&quot; of real property was not its market value. The court held (1) Ind. Const. art. 10, &sect; 1 intended that a taxpayer's property wealth be proportional to the overall property tax burden and required a system of property assessment and taxation based on market value; as such (2) the &quot;just value&quot; of real property was its market value; hence, (3) the &quot;true tax value&quot; system under Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-31-6(c) was unconstitutional; and (4) a uniform method for calculating &quot;just value&quot; was not required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The majority of taxpayer's income was derived from its cable subscriptions. Taxpayer argued that it should have been taxed at the lower rate because it was selling at retail as opposed to providing a service.

The court found no statutory definition for cable television programming but determined, based on legislative intent, that it was to be regarded as the provision of a service. The court also found that taxpayer's argument over equal protection was meritless because it was not similarly situated to conventional television broadcasters who derived income through advertising instead of subscriptions. The court determined that the First Amendment argument was equally meritless because the gross income tax did not single out the press nor did it raise concerns about censorship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer had used federal grant money to purchase certain property, including rail, ties, and ballasts. The taxpayer had also spent $ 900,000 to repair a nearly 100-year-old bridge worth approximately $ 1. On appeal, the taxpayer argued that the grant property was not assessable to it because the United States actually owned it. The court affirmed, holding that for all intents and purposes, the grant property was the taxpayer's property. Accordingly, the State Board had authority to assess the taxpayer for the grant property based on the fact that the taxpayer used it pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-8-1. It made no difference that the United States might have fully or partially owned the grant property. Also, while the repair work may not have caused the bridge to have an increased functional capacity, old parts of the bridge were replaced with new parts, and the bridge was made able to withstand a river current. These facts could have led a reasonable mind to conclude that the estimated useful life of the bridge was increased.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner corporation sought review of a decision by respondent Indiana State Board of Tax Commissioners (state board), which found that the corporation was not entitled to a resource recovery system (RRS) property tax deduction for the March 1, 1993 assessment. The corporation filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that it was entitled to the RRS deduction under Ind. Code 6-1.1-12-28.5, as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporation's RRS was certified by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) on June 10, 1993. The corporation then sought to receive the RRS property tax deduction from the township for the March 1, 1993 property tax assessment by filing a Form RRS-1 with the county auditor. The county auditor denied the corporation's deduction on the ground that the corporation missed the filing deadline. The corporation subsequently filed two petitions for the correction of error (Form 133), which were denied by the state board. The corporation filed an original tax appeal with the court and thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment. The court granted the motion in part and denied in part and held that: (1) Form 130 and Form 133 overlap and could both be used to challenge objective errors in an assessment; (2) Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-12-35(a), was clear that the county auditor had no authority to deny the claimed deduction as untimely and must forward every Form RRS-1 to the township assessor for a determination; and (3) the township assessor had discretion to deny an untimely filed Form RRS-1 and the corporation was not entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted the corporation's motion for summary judgement in part and denied the motion in part. The court held that the township assessor and not the county auditor was the proper person to act on the corporation's untimely filed Form RRS-1 and that the county auditor must forward the Form RRS-1 to the township assessor for verification. The court held that the corporation was not entitled to the RRS deduction as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer alleged that the department erred in assessing it for the motor carrier fuel tax under Ind.

The taxpayer had installed computers on its trucks that tracked the time in which the trucks sat in traffic, and the periods in which the trucks sat idling off the highways while the drivers were taking a break. The court affirmed the department's deficiency determination because the total amount of fuel consumed, regardless of where and how it was consumed, was included in the formula for calculating motor carrier fuel tax liability. The court rejected the taxpayer's arguments that the tax violated the Interstate Commerce Clause and the Equal Protection Clause because the tax applied to an activity with a substantial nexus to the state, was fairly apportioned, did not discriminate against interstate commerce, was fairly related to the services provided by the state, and the taxing classification passed the rational basis test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The company stored its customers' steel at its facility in exchange for rental fees. The company failed to report steel in its possession belonging to seven of its customers on its business personal property tax forms. When the board discovered this, it determined that four of the customers had failed to self-report the steel they stored at the company's facility. The board increased the assessed value of the company's business personal property based on the presumed market value of the customers' unreported steel; denied the company an enterprise zone inventory credit or an interstate commerce exemption; and imposed a 20 percent undervaluation penalty. On appeal, the court affirmed the board's decisions on three issues and remanded on two. The court held that the company improperly failed to report its customers' property in its possession, and thus the board was permitted to look to the company for its remedy. The court ruled, however, that the board should have based its assessment on the steel's actual cost, rather than methods unsupported by substantial evidence, and therefore a remand was required for re-calculation of valuation and a 20 percent penalty based thereon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the board's determination as to three of five issues, but remanded two issues with regard to a re-calculation of its assessment, based on the actual value of steel stored at the company for its customers, and the penalty on that assessment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer was engaged in the business of steel processing and storage. The board's auditor determined that the taxpayer failed to report that it stored steel for seven different companies on the date that it filed its business tangible personal property return. Because four of the companies had not reported the steel on their returns, the auditor recommended that the taxpayer be assessed for the steel. The board adopted the recommendation, denied the taxpayer's request for an enterprise zone inventory credit, and imposed a 20 percent undervaluation penalty. On appeal, the court remanded the case to the board because it failed to properly determine the value of the steel. Moreover, whether a penalty was proper under Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-37-7(e) depended on the proper valuation of the steel. The court otherwise affirmed the board's determination. The board had authority to levy an assessment under Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-2-4 and the discretion to assess either the taxpayer or the owners of the steel. The taxpayer was not entitled to a free enterprise zone credit under Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners' house was searched pursuant to a search warrant.

The department was notified by law enforcement authorities and it assessed the petitioners with CSET liability, a 100 percent nonpayment penalty, a 10 percent collection fee, and a clerk's charge, for a total of $ 77,871.00. Interest began accruing immediately. Petitioners appealed. The court held that the CSET did not violate the privilege against self-incrimination, the right of equal protection, or the right of due process. The CSET, however, was a punishment for double jeopardy purposes and the department could not collect the tax from the wife, who had already pled guilty to possession, but could collect from the husband who had not.</SPAN></P>

The commissioners adopted the assessment against the taxpayers. Upon appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the plain language of Ind.

The commissioners' final determination exceeded statutory authority because it changed the taxpayers' assessment for certain years without giving them notice that the object of the hearing would be their assessment for that time. The court held that strict compliance with the notice requirement of Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-14-11 was particularly important because there was an untimely Form 131, and the hearing appeared to have been the only impetus for the commissioner's decision to reexamine the assessment sua sponte.</SPAN></P>

The company appealed. The court affirmed, remanded, and held that (1) the property tax was not in any way directed at suppressing any ideas, and imposition of the tax on the printed materials did not offend the First Amendment; (2) the materials constituted tangible property &quot;held, used, or consumed in connection with the production of income&quot; within the meaning of Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer was in the business of selling and servicing new and used automobiles. The taxpayer often assisted its customers in financing the purchase of vehicles by providing installment sales contracts, which it sold or assigned to various financing agencies or financial institutions. For the years in issue, installment contracts were regarded as intangibles under Ind. Code &sect; 6-5.1-1-1 (repealed). The taxpayer acquired a permit stamp to endorse its intangibles pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 6-5.1-4-3 (repealed). The Department revoked the taxpayer's stamp permit. The legislature subsequently repealed the intangibles tax. On appeal, the court held that the taxpayer exercised the privileges of executing and assigning intangibles and was therefore liable for the tax, as liability arose with exercise. The court held that such liability was not extinguished by the repeal of the intangibles tax and its enforcement provisions. The court held that the Department was well within its authority to assess, collect, and enforce the taxpayer's intangibles tax liabilities incurred.</SPAN></P>

The state board did not act on the petition and the landowners sought review, challenging the assessment as a violation of Ind. Const. art. X, &sect; 1 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The state board filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, the landowners lacked standing, and they failed to exhaust administrative remedies. The court denied the motion, holding that the state board had an affirmative duty under Ind. Const. art. X, &sect; 1 to review tax assessments to ensure uniformity and equality. The court reasoned that the landowners' petition was sufficient to trigger the state board's duty and authority to act and its failure to do so constituted a final determination within the meaning of Ind. Code &sect; 33-3-5-2(a) over which the court had subject matter jurisdiction. The court further held that the landowners were not required to exhaust administrative remedies because the adjudication of the landowners' constitutional claims was beyond the state board's competency, expertise, and authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner publisher appealed from a final determination of respondent Indiana Department of State Revenue denying the refund of state gross retail tax paid under Ind. Code &sect; 6-2.5-1-1 et seq. for prior tax years on sales of its publication. The publisher, the department, and respondent Commissioner of the Indiana Department of State Revenue all moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The publisher sought review when the department denied its application for refund of taxes paid on sales of its publication. The publisher contended that the criteria to determine whether a publication was a newspaper under Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-26(b)(2) discriminated on the basis of the content of speech in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court found that the statute impermissibly required the department to determine whether a publication was a &quot;newspaper&quot; based upon its content and that the department's regulation was not necessary to serve a compelling state interest and was not narrowly drawn to achieve that end. The court determined that the proper remedy was to invalidate Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-26(b)(2). The court refused to determine whether the publication was a newspaper within the terms of the newspaper exemption because such a determination was a question of fact and not appropriate for consideration in a motion for summary judgment. The court found that 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 provided an adequate legal remedy and that injunctive relief was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted the publisher's motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether the statute unconstitutionally discriminated on the basis of the content of speech. The court denied the department's motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether the publication was a newspaper within the terms of the newspaper exemption. The court denied the publisher's motion for summary judgment on its civil rights claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After auditing the taxpayer, the department determined that it owed sales tax on its purchases of supplies, utilities, and equipment associated with its business of breeding rats for medical use. The taxpayer paid the taxes and after its claim for refund was denied, brought the present action. The court found that the taxpayer's operation fit within the legislature's intent in enacting the industrial exemptions because the legislature specifically included impregnation as a process within the meaning of the exemptions. The court found that the taxpayer would be entitled to the benefits of the exemption if it could prove which specific purposes met the requirements of the exemptions. The court concluded that the taxpayer's claims concerning the purchase of utility services would be exempt from sales tax if the taxpayer could prove that specific purposes fell within the exemptions. The court held that the taxpayer did not suffer a violation of the &quot;ascertainable standards&quot; rule because the regulations were not specifically addressed to any taxpayer and, therefore, the taxpayer did not have an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, two electric companies, challenged the final determination of respondent state revenue department, which assessed gross income tax, adjusted gross income tax, and supplemental net income tax, including interest and penalties for the years 1985, 1986, and 1987, on sales of electricity to two Indiana purchasers. The cases were heard and decided together.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that a tax on the income from interstate sales of electricity when the generation, transmission, and consumption simultaneously occurred within the state was internally inconsistent because a clear risk of multiple taxation existed and was externally inconsistent because it taxed much more than Indiana's fair share of the electricity generated there that was actually resold there. The court therefore found that the portion of electric company one's gross income received from interstate sales of electricity to electric company two that equaled electric company two's total sales to purchasers was entitled to the interstate commerce exemption under Ind. Code &sect; 6-2.1-3-3 because the tax was internally and externally inconsistent and was therefore not fairly apportioned, failing the second prong of the Complete Auto test and offending the Commerce Clause. The court found that Indiana law did not authorize the imposition of gross income tax on electric company two because it had been assessed gross income tax on the same sales for which electric company one had been assessed for sales to the two purchasers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-8-32 petitioner public utility companies appealed final assessments which respondent State Board of Tax Commissioners (Indiana) made of their distributable property. The utility companies asserted that the State Board needed to apply the economic obsolescence adjustment in its assessment of their telephone property under Ind. Admin. Code tit. 50, r. 5-4-2(b) (1988).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Public utility companies in the telephone industry challenged assessments of their distributable property made by the State Board. The court set aside and remanded those assessments. Under Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-8-32, a tax court could set aside State Board assessments that were not supported by substantial evidence or were made in violation of the law. Pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-8-26(a) the value of distributable property was based on the total value or unit value of a public utility company's property minus the value of its fixed property. The companies involved in this dispute asked the State Board to grant adjustments for economic obsolescence in the manner applied to railroad companies. The State Board was not required by Ind. Const. art. X, &sect; 1(a) to provide uniform methods of assessment for different classes of public utility companies and it had valid reasons for treating railroad companies differently from telephone companies. Nonetheless, Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-8-42 mandated that assessments be fair. The court found that the State Board had to consider whether an adjustment for economic obsolescence was necessary to prevent unfair assessments of the company's property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court set aside the State Board's assessments of the utility companies' distributable property and remanded this matter back to the State Board for further consideration.</SPAN></P>

The taxing authority and the official filed a motion to dismiss the claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Ind. R. Trial P. 12(B)(1). The court denied the motion to dismiss and held that its exercise of exclusive jurisdiction over the claim was compulsory. The court's compulsory exercise of concurrent jurisdiction was not barred by the Tax Injunction Act of 1937, the doctrine of equitable restraint, or the presence of an exclusive state remedy. The court held that the taxpayer's state and federal claims derived from a common nucleus of operative fact, raised substantial state issues, and would have been tried together in a single proceeding because the construction and application of Indiana's sales tax laws were determinative. The court held that the taxpayer's &sect; 1983 claim independently invoked the tax court's concurrent subject matter jurisdiction because the &quot;arises under&quot; language in Ind.

Further, the department had not established a requirement that that the type of computerized notices sent to the taxpayer should be signed.

The court held that the company did not own the U.S. Treasury Notes and obligations and, therefore, was not entitled to an exemption under 31 U.S. C. S. &sect; 3124 and Ind. Code &sect; 6-3-1-3.5(b). The court found that the company did not bear the risk involved in the transaction. The bank had the right to sell the securities and the company did not. As true ownership of securities was indicated by the owner's ability to sell to third parties, the only possible conclusion was that the company did not own the securities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer admitted that it was not the owner of the grain that was stored in its elevators. The taxpayer contended that it was treated as owner for assessment purposes, therefore, it should have been given the right of the owner to claim exemption. The Board's initial motion for partial summary judgment was denied, however, the Board pleaded for reconsideration based on stipulations and answers to interrogatories. The court granted the Board's motion. The court found that the taxpayer could not claim the exemption under Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-10-29 because it was not the holder of the legal title to the grain. The court stated that the taxpayer incorrectly assumed that the assessment was based on ownership. The court noted that the assessment was made under Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-2-4(b) on the basis that that taxpayer possessed the property and failed to establish that the property was assessed and taxed in the name of the owner. The court concluded by rejecting the taxpayer's constitutional challenge because the taxpayer failed to carry its burden in its challenge to the constitutionality of certain statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The church owned and operated a camp that was situated on a 175-acre parcel of property. Prior to 1983, the Board granted the church a 100 percent tax exemption for the property and the improvements situated thereon. In 1983, the Board denied the exemption for the caretaker's house located on the property and for all land in excess of 50 acres. On appeal, the court first determined that the Board's denial of an exemption for the caretaker's house was supported by substantial evidence. The court rejected the church's contention that the house was used for religious purposes and was thus exempt under Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-10-16, noting that the only evidence before the Board indicated that the house was used as a residence by the caretaker and his wife. The court also found that the Board's denial of the exemption was neither arbitrary nor capricious, noting that the doctrine of legislative acquiescence did not apply to the Board's prior granting of the exemption. Further, the court found that Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-10-25, which granted certain organizations a property tax exemption with no acreage limitation, did not deny the church the equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers challenged the SHU tax, claiming that it inherently discriminated against interstate commerce. The court held that the tax was unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution and enjoined the department from collecting any tax pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 6-6-8 and from further enforcing &sect; 6-6-8. It found that the SHU tax was a flat tax, unapportioned to actual use of the highways, and failed the internal consistency test because if each state applied a flat tax of like the SHU tax, an impermissible interference with free trade would result. The court rejected the department's contention that the tax was a reasonable fee for the use of the highway, as the tax did not vary directly with mileage traveled in the state and the tax could be imposed by other states, subjecting the interstate carrier to a greater cumulative tax burden than the single state carrier. Further, the SHU tax was not fairly apportioned, as the tax was applied to the type of vehicle that related to highway damage, but it was not related to the extent of the taxpayers' contact with the state.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 6-6-8-1 et seq., pending an original tax appeal for a refund of such taxes. Respondents moved to dismiss for want of jurisdiction under Ind. Code &sect; 33-3-5-11 and to disqualify petitioners' counsel on grounds that he was a witness in the cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners argued that the SHUF violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and they sought to outright bar collection of the tax or that such moneys raised be placed in escrow pending an original tax refund appeal. Respondents moved to dismiss and for disqualification of petitioners' attorney. In denying respondents' motions, the court ruled that petitioners had complied with Ind. Code &sect; 33-3-5-11 and the court therefore had jurisdiction. Also, they failed to show that petitioners' attorney was a necessary witness that would preclude his acting as counsel. In ordering that the collected funds be placed in an escrow account pending the original tax appeal upon the posting of a bond by petitioners, the court ruled that recent precedent indicated that petitioners were likely to prevail on the merits of their constitutional claim and they would suffer irreparable harm if preliminary relief were denied, in that a ruling that the tax was unconstitutional might be given prospective application only. Given the amount of SHUF to be collected, the harm to respondents would be slight. Also, the public interest favored relief.</SPAN></P>

The state challenged the association's motion. The court granted the injunction in favor of the association. The court found that the association would have suffered irreparable harm if the injunction was not issued while the constitutionality of the tax was being litigated. A stipulation entered into by the parties did not decide that issue of sovereign immunity and that meant the association had a slight basis for maintaining that they did not have an adequate remedy at law. The court found that the amount of revenue collected under the SHUF was small in comparison to the total revenue budgeted by state and local governments for road repairs. The harm to the association by denying equitable relief was not outweighed by harm to the state. Once the case was decided on the merits an order for an escrow account was in the best interests of the parties.</SPAN></P>

The Board argued that such a notice was not timely filed and moved to dismiss the taxpayer's appeal. Upon consideration, the court overruled and denied the Board's motion to dismiss, holding that, because Ind.
