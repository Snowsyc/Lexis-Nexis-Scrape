<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed decisions of the Superior Court (Massachusetts), which entered judgments of conviction on verdicts of guilty of murder in the second degree (the indictment having charged murder in the first degree), assault with intent to murder, and assault by means of a dangerous weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After a brief conversation between defendant and the murder victim, the two had a fistfight. Defendant then got a gun and shot the victim three times, killing him. Defendant struck the assault victim with the revolver and then shot her, blinding her right eye. He stated that the shooting occurred because his brother had been killed. Defendant moved to quash the venire on the stated grounds that the jury did not adequately represent various groups. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgments of conviction. Defendant's motion failed to disclose a cognizable basis for challenging the venire. All the evidence taken together did not make a prima facie case calling on the Commonwealth to furnish an explanation. In the absence of even minimal substantiation of the charges defendant made in his motion, the trial court was justified in declining to grant defendant a continuance. No objection was taken to a jury instruction with respect to manslaughter, and thus there was no basis for review. However, the trial court made it clear to the jury that in order to find malice they had to find a state of mind free from passion generated by provocation. On the whole the jury charge was adequate.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the trial court granted defendant's petition for release after finding that he was no longer sexually dangerous and ordered his conditional release. A few years later, the commonwealth filed a motion to recommit defendant, and the trial court ordered his recommitment. On appeal, the court reversed the order of the trial court and held that there was no statutory basis for convening new proceedings to determine whether or not defendant was a sexually dangerous person at the time that the commonwealth filed its motion to recommit. Further, the trial court had no constitutional authority to recommit defendant because he had previously been found not to be a sexually dangerous person, and the trial court could not validly vacate that prior finding. The court ordered that the finding be reinstated and that defendant be discharged from custody. A breach of a release condition did not give rise to a &sect; 5 proceeding to determine anew defendant's sexual dangerousness once he had been adjudicated to be no longer sexually dangerous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, who was indigent, was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. He had been informed of his right under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 263, &sect; 5A at his expense, to be examined immediately by a physician selected by him, and of his right under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24(1)(e) at his expense to have a blood test by a person or physician selected by him. Defendant brought a motion to dismiss on the grounds that those statutes were unconstitutional, because they made no provision for testing at public expense for indigents. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant was convicted. He brought a bill of exceptions. The court upheld the statutes and affirmed the conviction because defendant was examined by a certified breathalyzer operator and was over the legal limit, which created a presumption that he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Therefore, the court reasoned that this was not a situation in which it would have been constitutionally unfair to fail to compensate for an indigent defendant's inability to secure further medical testing. Also, there was no denial of his due process or equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder indictment, to be followed by a term of 15 to 20 years on the assault indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and other offenses arising from the attempted armed robbery of a convenience store. Affirming defendant's convictions, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 277, &sect; 51 for a change of venue on grounds of pretrial publicity. The court also concluded that the trial court properly refused to allow defendant to cross-examine two state's witnesses concerning their involvement in prior and unrelated crimes, because such evidence was inadmissible under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, &sect; 21 in the absence of criminal convictions. The court upheld the trial court's ruling that these witnesses had not waived their rights against self-incrimination by testifying before the grand jury as to involvement in other crimes, because they had been mistaken as to the extent of the immunity granted them under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, &sect; 20G. The court further found that the testimony of the immunized witnesses was sufficiently corroborated pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, &sect; 20I under the circumstances of this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporations alleged that the adoption of the proposed amendment would substantially and materially affect their business activities in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, discouraging highly qualified executives and highly skilled professional personnel from settling, working, or remaining in that state. The court denied the relief because the corporations failed to show that the proposed amendment had in fact materially affected their business. The plaintiffs had not made such a showing. The court concluded that the proposed amendment was not unconstitutional as applied to the corporations because the activities mentioned were not included within the legislative proscription in Mass. Gen. Law. ch. 55, &sect; 8. The court held that the statutory proscription, the prohibition against corporate expenditures on a referendum question solely concerning a personal graduated tax on the income of individuals, was not vague because it was both precise and definite. The court also found that &sect; 8 did not contain an irrebuttable presumption and did not deprive the corporations of their right to due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff minor sought review of a decision of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, which determined that Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 112, &sect; 12P (1974), a statute that set forth certain conditions for the performance of an abortion on an unmarried minor, was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Section 12P required parental or judicial approval before a nonemergency abortion could have been performed on an unmarried minor. The court held that apart from the effect of any constitutionally valid restrictions that were imposed on the legislature's regulation of abortions, parental consultation was properly required in every instance where an unmarried minor sought a non-emergency abortion. The court held that if the minor's parents, or their legal equivalent, were unavailable, parental consultation was not required. The court determined that in deciding whether to consent to an abortion for their unmarried minor daughter, parents should consider only her best interests and that if one or both parents refused consent, a judge of the superior court could have properly authorized an abortion for an unmarried minor. The court held that a judge was required to rule that an abortion was in the minor's best interests if judicial consent was granted. The court held that the parents, if available, were required to be notified of the court proceeding and were required to be allowed to participate in it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, the Board of Selectmen of Nantucket (board) and Historic District Commission of Nantucket (commission), appealed the annulment by the Superior Court (Massachusetts) of the commission's and board's decisions disapproving the plans of plaintiffs, current and former owners of land near the Old and Historic Nantucket District, to build on the land, allegedly because the plans were incongruous with the historic aspects of the island.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owners sought to build on the land at issue, but the commission disapproved the plans, allegedly because they were incongruous with the historic aspects of the island. The owners appealed to the board, which affirmed, and then to the trial court. The trial court annulled both decisions, ruling that the commission and the board had exceeded their authority, and ordered the commission to issue certificates of appropriateness to the owners. The court transferred the appeal to itself and affirmed as modified. The court agreed that the commission's decision could not stand because it went beyond the commission's purpose of preventing developments incongruous to the historic aspects of the district, thus exceeding the commission's authority, and should have been annulled by the board. The board's failure to annul the commission's decision exceeded the board's authority and the board's decision was thus properly annulled by the trial judge. However, the court reversed the trial judge's decision in so far as it ordered the commission to issue the certificates. The very narrow circumstances in which a judge could order the board to issue a special permit were not presented.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court ordered that the judgment entered in the trial court was to be modified by striking out that part of the order that required the issuance of certificates of appropriateness, and substituting a new paragraph directing the commission to hold such further proceedings as might have been necessary on the owners' applications. Thus modified, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The independent presidential candidates the grant of a stay of the order compelling the state secretary to certify their names on the election ballots. The court observed that the trial court had granted the stay pending the state secretary's appeal based upon the conclusion that no review of the ballot certification process was available unless the local registrars who had failed to certify the signatures were named as defendants and that is was therefore unlikely that the judgment compelling certification would be affirmed on appeal. The court affirmed the trial judge's ruling that the independent candidates were entitled to have their names ballot certified because the substantive requirements for such certification were met. The court explained that the burden was on the state secretary to rebut the presumption of validity created by obtaining the requisite number of nomination signatures. The court explained that local registrars lacked discretion to require more of the signatures than specified in the nomination statute. The court found that the heavy burden of rechecking the signatures was improperly placed upon the independent candidate. Thus, the court dissolved the stay.</SPAN></P>

He did not contend that the picture was not obscene, but based his appeal on the argument that motions for dismissal and for directed verdicts on the grounds of unconstitutionality of the obscenity statute were improperly denied. The court affirmed the convictions and concluded that the obscenity statute was constitutional facially and as applied to the case. The court further concluded that there was no error in the denial of the defendant's motion to dismiss and motions for directed verdicts. A civil judgment in defendant's favor did not estop the criminal conviction. The equal protection claims did not involve First Amendment values. The classifications distinguished between species of materials, not between protected and unprotected expression. The statutory scheme met the minimum constitutional requirements for procedural protection of First Amendment values. The obscenity statute was not overbroad in its definition of obscene matter or of criminal knowledge, and the statutory definition of obscenity was sufficiently specific to provide adequate notice as to proscribed conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The district attorneys filed several actions against the corporation, alleging that it was exhibiting obscene motion pictures and requested injunctive relief. The trial judge viewed the films and heard expert testimony offered by the district attorneys and the corporation. The trial judge found that the films lacked any serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, and that they appealed to prurient interest. However, he found that the district attorneys had failed to show by a preponderance of credible evidence that the films depicted sexual conduct in a patently offensive way and ruled the films not &quot;obscene&quot; within the definition set forth by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 31. In reaching this conclusion, the trial judge ruled that expert testimony was required concerning the type of matter that would offend the average person in the state. The court reversed the judgment, by holding that there was no constitutional requirement that the prosecution offer expert testimony on the issue of obscenity itself because the trier of fact could draw on his own knowledge of normative views in his own community in applying statutorily prescribed community standards.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the Department improperly disapproved the rate for particular services on the ground that the company had supplied insufficient data as to the cost of that service.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners argued that the rates for insurance coverage set by respondent did not meet the requirements of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 175, &sect; 113B, even though his decisions individually were correct, because the end results suggested unfair predisposition. The court noted that its responsibility in rate review was limited to determining whether rates were reasonably supported by record evidence. The court then found that the use of a two-year average to come up with a more stable development factor was not wrong, that trend and projection factors were appropriately based on studies performed by actuaries, and that respondent's leaving the definition of effective anti-theft device to insurers did not warrant remand. The court found that the second-look provision in &sect; 113B was repealed, so that respondent did not have to adjust current rates to compensate for shortfalls in previous years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Probate Court for the County of Norfolk (Massachusetts) reserved decision on plaintiff trustees' challenge to defendant tax commissioner's imposition of inheritance taxes on transfers to certain adopted children. The trustees request for direct appellate review of the judgment was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decedent created a testamentary trust administered by the trustees. The trust provided that the decedent's daughter could distribute her share of the trust by her will. One of decedent's daughters exercised her power of appointment in favor of her adopted children. The tax commissioner argued that the legacy to the adopted children was subject to taxation under the inheritance tax statute in effect at the time of decedent's death. The court found that the tax was valid. Although the legislature had eliminated the distinction in the inheritance tax tables between lineal descendants and adopted children of lineal descendants, those revised rates were applicable only to property passing upon the death of a person who died after the effective date of the revision. The classification satisfied the requirements of equal protection. Lines based upon the date of death were drawn to make a tax system workable and alterable and thus were presumptively rational. Further, the different treatment given to adopted children from that given natural children under the former probate law was not constitutionally infirm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In two consolidated cases, plaintiff towns appealed a decision of the Superior Court (Massachusetts), seeking declaratory relief from enforcement of the arbitration awards for defendants, Board of Conciliation and Arbitration and union representatives (board), under 1973 Mass. Acts ch. 1078, &sect; 4 (1973). The town challenged the statute as unconstitutional and in conflict with other laws. Other cities joined the town as amici curiae.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 1078 &sect; 4 (1973) (act) was a proper employment of &sect; 8 of the Home Rule Amendment. The arbitrators' award related solely to wages and benefits and Mass. Gen. Laws ch.150E, &sect; 7 provided that the terms of the collective bargaining agreement prevailed when there was any conflict between it and a municipal ordinance, rule, or regulation. The act was also not an unconstitutional delegation of power to a panel of private individuals, in violation of the Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights amend. art. 30 and the Mass. Const. art. 4, &sect; 1, cl. 1, pt. 2, because the legislature may delegate to a board the implementation of details of a legislative policy. The court found that there were extensive safeguards against arbitrary action and they provided the act with a sound constitutional basis. The one-man, one-vote concept did not apply to an arbitration panel that did not exercise general legislative power. The act was not inconsistent with the municipal finance laws and there was no bar to requiring the town to meet by appropriation the award. The court concluded that the act was constitutional and entered a judgment affirming the award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The complainants were convicted of assault and battery on police officers.

The court held that: (1) the commission had authority to investigate allegations that the police used excessive force in making an arrest, although it had no adjudicatory powers but could merely make recommendations to other agencies; (2) the use of excessive force in an arrest was a civil rights violation; (3) due process did not require judicial review of the commission's conclusions; (4) the ordinance was not vague or overbroad; and (5) the criminal convictions did not resolve the complaints of excessive force because, although they were found guilty, excessive force still could have been used in the arrests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, a mobile home park tenant, appealed the decision of a Superior Court (Massachusetts) where the court held that Mass.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendant, a mobile home park owner. Plaintiff claimed that certain of defendant's practices relating to the operation of his park were unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of the Mobile Home Statute (Statute), Mass. Gen.

The court agreed that &sect;&sect; 32L(1) and (6) were constitutional. The court held that &sect; 32M was not an unconstitutional taking of property.

</DIV>

Although defendant did not contend that his appointed counsel supplied the Massachusetts Defenders Committee (MDC) was incompetent, he challenged Mass. Sup. Jud. Ct. R. 53(3), which did not require the trial court to satisfy that the attorney was fully qualified. Noting that defendant was not deprived of effective assistance of counsel, the court found that the rule requiring the MDC to supply qualified attorneys was reasonable. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion: (1) by denying defendant's motion for the production of all relevant police reports; (2) by refusing to allow the defense to ask the victim about where she wore her diamond rings and defendant's mother about any hostility with the victim; and (3) by admitting photographs of the victim taken three days after the attack by her attorney who testified that the victim identified defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer sold its assets pursuant to a liquidation and the assets went into a trust to pay creditors. The court reversed the commission's and the board's decisions, which held that the income realized from the sale of trust assets under a plan of liquidation adopted pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 337 was not taxable. The court held that the taxpayer's gain clearly was not part of its federal gross income and therefore was not part of the taxpayer's Massachusetts gross income. The court denied the commission's contention that business trusts were treated traditionally as individuals and not as corporations for Massachusetts income tax purposes because such an interpretation would have made Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 62, &sect; 8(a) (1971) unnecessary. The court rejected the commission's contention that the taxpayer's shareholders could not be subject to tax on any gain from the liquidation of the trust because the statutory language suggested that that any tax that would have been applicable would have been taxable to the shareholders and not to the trust.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(a) did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because (1) the nature of the penalty was rationally directed to achieve the legitimate ends of punishment, (2) the penalty was not disproportionate because in comparison to punishments imposed within the state for similar crimes it because leniency in some cases did not transform a reasonable punishment in another case to a cruel one, and (3) although other jurisdictions did not subject a first offender to a mandatory sentence for carrying a firearm without a license, some had provided for a maximum penalty that was equal to if not more severe than that of &sect; 10(a). Section 10(a) did not deny defendant due process because knowledge of the accused that he was carrying a firearm was a necessary element of the offense.

The city filed suit to enforce an ordinance requiring a license. The trial court granted the city a restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and a permanent injunction.

The court held there was ample indication of arbitrary and capricious administration of the ordinance, and hence of the danger of unfairness and discrimination which justified the vagueness doctrine. The court found that because it could have been properly assumed that the ordinance was void both on its face and as applied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff voters brought an action against defendants, the Secretary of the Commonwealth and others, in the Superior Court, Suffolk County (Massachusetts), which transferred the case to the court, contesting the constitutionality of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 600, &sect; 13 (1975), which amended Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &sect; 70B. The voters also claimed that certain provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 600 (1975) did not apply to the 1976 presidential primary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Formerly, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &sect; 70B, delegates were elected at presidential primaries. With the passage of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 600, &sect; 13 (1975), delegates to national conventions of political parties where presidential candidates were to be nominated were to be selected pursuant to a different method adopted by the party's state committee. The voters sued defendants for a declaration that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 600, &sect; 13 was unconstitutional and that the procedures in Mass Gen. Laws ch. 600 for the selection of committee members did not apply to the 1976 presidential primary. The lower court reserved decision and transferred the action to the court, which found for defendants. The court explained that there was no state and federal conflict because the national political parties did not mandate the election of convention delegates at a primary. Neither did the United States or Massachusetts Constitutions. Similarly, there was no constitutional requirement that the votes of party convention delegates reflect the presidential primary. The immediate effective date of ch. 600 was also constitutional, the court ruled, and any difficulties that it imposed were easily surmounted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found for defendants and declared: that the direct election of national delegates was not constitutionally required; that there was no constitutional obligation that a delegate to a convention of a national political party vote at any time in response to the vote on the presidential preference portion of the primary ballot; that the statute regarding the distribution of delegates was not unconstitutionally vague; and other declarations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant contended on appeal that he was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial because the trial judge excused a woman juror pursuant to Mass.

Over defendant's objection, the trial judge advised each potential woman juror that she could be excused if she would be embarrassed by hearing the testimony or discussing it in the jury room. One woman chose to be excluded; one woman did not. The trial judge believed that he was obliged to bring to the attention of women jurors their option of withdrawing if they would have been embarrassed to serve because ch. 234, &sect; 1A provided that no woman was required to serve in the trial of any prosecutions of certain sex crimes and obscenity cases if, upon her representation it appeared to the presiding justice that she would be likely to have been embarrassed by hearing the testimony or by discussing the same in the jury room. The court upheld the exclusion of the woman and ch. 234, &sect; 1A. The court held that ch. 234, &sect; 1A did not provide for an automatic exemption for all women and only applied where the trial involved a sex-related crime. The court found that such a classification was rational.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that it was error to admit his record because the Commonwealth failed to show that he had either been represented by counsel or had waived his right to be represented by counsel. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, finding that defendant waived his right to be represented by counsel. The court explained that the trial court had found that defendant was not entitled to have counsel assigned to represent him at public expense, that he was able to afford counsel, and that he had a reasonable time to obtain counsel between the trial court's ruling and his trial. The court opined that defendant's failure to obtain counsel in such circumstances resulted in his intentional and knowing waiver of his constitutional right to be represented by counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff city brought suit against defendant dance club, seeking to enjoin the dance club from violating Mass.  Gen. Law ch. 272, &sect; 16. The Superior Court, Suffolk County (Massachusetts) determined that &sect; 16 was unconstitutional and invalid. The trial court denied the city's request for an injunction. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Mass.  Gen. Law ch. 272, &sect; 16 prohibited open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior in nude dancer bars. The ordinance prescribed new terms and conditions on which licenses would be revoked or denied. The dance club argued that the city licensing board had the power to pass such an ordinance, not the city council. Therefore, the dance club argued that the city acted outside its powers in enacting the ordinance. However, the court determined that the city had authority to enact such an amendment. The court found that the trial court properly concluded that the ordinance was too vague and overbroad for the purpose of imposing criminal liability. Accordingly, the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that dismissed the city's action. The court vacated the dance club's judgment and remanded for an order that the statute was unconstitutional where there was no imposition of behavior on an unsuspecting or unwilling person, that the ordinance was not invalid on its face, and that the city should have been enjoined from enforcing unconstitutional provisions of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A bill was pending before the Senate. The Senate asked the court whether it was unconstitutional, as an infringement of contract between the donors of the park and the city, for a statute to authorize the city to use the park as a public school site. The court answered &quot;yes.&quot; The court held that enactment of the bill would violate the Contract Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, because the bill described an area to be diverted to school purposes which encompassed a tract that was acquired in trust by the city for public use and enjoyment. Regarding that tract of land, the grantor, by inserting the word &quot;forever&quot; in the granting clause, expressed an intent in plain words to create a trust in perpetuity of the subject parcel. Regarding another tract of land with a deed restriction in the nature of a possibility of reverter, enforcement of the contractual rights of those claiming under the grantor was barred by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, &sect; 31A, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 184, &sect;&sect; 26, 28, which operated as a statute of limitations. If the bill were amended to change which tracts of the park land were included, there would be no impediments to its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The court believed that because of changes in circumstances since the case was reported to the full court, particularly the effect of another decision and the effect of changes in the method of selecting traverse jurors in Suffolk County, the court should not exercise its extraordinary power under Mass.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A transfer hearing moved the case from juvenile to adult court. After the prisoner was convicted of breaking and entering a building in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony and of murder in the first degree, and was sentenced to prison terms of life and eight to 15 years, respectively, the prisoner appealed. The court affirmed. If the decision in Breed v. Jones were to be applied retroactively the prisoner was not subjected to double jeopardy. The court did not apply the decision retroactively. Under the facts of the case, the prisoner was never put in jeopardy of being adjudged a delinquent. The prisoner's claim that he was not permitted to comment upon his prior juvenile record or on the possibility of his successful treatment as a juvenile lacked support in the record. The court could not believe that a decision to transfer the prisoner for trial as an adult on a charge of murder could have been altered by a review of the prisoner's extensive record of prior offenses and adjudications of delinquency. The prisoner cited no precedent for the claim that a compelling state interest had to support a transfer decision, and the court declined to create one.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the abductors' failure to apprise defendant of his Miranda rights did not require suppression of the statements because the abductors were not acting as an agent of the police. The court also held that defendant's voluntary statements to the police were available to impeach his testimony because the police interrogation did not overbear the defendant's will and did not extract an involuntary statement from him. However, the court vacated the conviction and imposed a guilty verdict for manslaughter because defendant's statements showed that the killing lacked the element of malice aforethought necessary to support a murder verdict.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 7, &sect;&sect; 30K-30P, filed with the court a petition for a writ of mandamus for declaratory relief seeking a finding that defendant Rate Setting Commission (Massachusetts) was obligated to allow it a larger final rate rather than a smaller interim rate for services provided under the Medicaid program during a rate freeze created by 1969 Mass. Acts. ch. 800, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The nursing home contended that as 1969 Mass. Acts ch. 800, &sect; 6 referred to &quot;fee schedules,&quot; it was not intended to freeze the specific dollar amount of the interim rate but only the formula for determining rates. The Commission argued that the interim rate was itself the fee schedule since it was a general regulation prescribing methods of settling accounts. The court entered judgment holding the interim rate payable. The court thought that the legislative intent underlying &sect; 6 was to freeze the cost to the state expressed by the interim rate and not to freeze the final rate which was to be subsequently determined and retroactively applied. The court noted that the rate freeze statute made express reference to the fee schedules in effect on a specific date. The court pointed out that the ordinary meaning of &quot;in effect&quot; was currently in operation or presently existing, which was inconsistent with an interpretation of &quot;in effect&quot; as implying a rate to be determined finally months, or in the case before it, over a year, after the specified date. The court inferred that the legislature intended that the interim rate should apply to the entire effective period of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court directed that a judgment was to be entered declaring that the interim rate for services provided during the freeze period was to be paid to the nursing home rather than the final rate that the nursing home claimed in its action against the Commission.</SPAN></P>

The second question was whether the inclusion of the term &quot;recreation enterprises&quot; within the definition of industrial development facilities, as that definition had been discussed in various opinions of the justices, raised a constitutional question as to the validity of its being a public purpose within the meaning of the Massachusetts Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The questions for the court were (1) whether the court should grant defendant's motion to dismiss and (2) what standards should be applied in considering offenses involving the use of language and related conduct under a disorderly person complaint. Defendant claimed that the disorderly person provision of &sect; 53 was unconstitutionally overbroad with respect to protected U. S. Const. amend. I expression and was void for vagueness. On appeal, the court held that the offense of being a disorderly person, in so far as it encompassed speech or expressive conduct, was not narrowly and precisely drawn to ensure that it reached only that speech which the state had a justifiable and compelling interest in regulating and was therefore overbroad. However, as reaching to conduct, the &sect; 53 &quot;idle and disorderly person&quot; provision was neither unconstitutionally overbroad nor vague. Accordingly, the &quot;idle and disorderly person&quot; provision of &sect; 53 as it stood could not be validly applied against persons for the use of offensive and abusive language.

The council submitted questions to the court expressing doubts as to the constitutionality of Exec. Order No. 114. In answering the questions, the court held that the governor had the constitutional right to establish the committee, because he possessed powers incidental to his constitutional responsibility to nominate and appoint judicial officers, which included enlisting such aid as he deemed necessary to investigate the availability of qualified candidates. The governor could delegate that incidental authority to investigate to the commission. The court found that the governor had not created any civil or public office, a power reserved for the legislature, because commission members were not delegated any sovereign power.</SPAN></P>

The mayor and the council argued that the board of health had no power to compel the council to appropriate money. The court held that the board of health could have been regarded as a state agent with derivative power to compel funding by the council for the particular purpose of fluoridation. Accordingly, the decree of the bill for declaratory relief was to be modified to declare the rights between the parties. The decree of dismissal of the companion equity bill would be affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The lower court held that the appointment should have been given effect. The adopted children appealed and the court concluded that decision of the lower court was correct. The settlor's disposition left it to the decedent's judgment what she might want to do about anyone not of her blood when she came to exercise her power of appointment.

The court observed that if proceedings had been begun while a defendant was a prisoner, custody could be retained and the proceedings carried to completion. The court stated that application of ch. 123A to the inmate violated his right to equal protection.

Laws ch. 138, &sect; 18 by repealing the provision which permitted a licensed alcoholic beverages wholesaler also to hold a retailer's license and replacing it by a prohibition on such double holdings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The House asked whether the enactment of H.B. 1488 (Mass. 1975) would constitute an unconstitutional impairment of the rights to due process and equal protection of the laws of the licensees, family members, and corporations affected by the proposed legislation. The court answered the questions in the negative. The court perceived no taking of property without compensation, and it pointed out that the requirement for disposal of licenses was itself not an unconstitutional impairment of property rights because property rights in businesses were not absolute but were subject to reasonable regulation within the police power. The court saw a rational basis for the classifications made, one which furthered a legitimate state interest. The court observed that requirements that a licensee offer alcoholic beverages for sale to all retail licensees within its marketing territory, regularly advertise by trade journal or direct mail all alcoholic beverages purchased by it which it offered for sale, and employ salesmen licensed to solicit orders from retail licensees promoted the elimination of vertical integration of the industry.</SPAN></P>

The bill required all independent candidates for public elective office in a state, city, or town election to not be enrolled members of a political party at least 28 days prior to the last date for filing nomination papers. The question propounded was whether the bill would be an unconstitutional impairment of the equal right of all inhabitants to elected office. The issue was whether the purposes of bill reasonably justified barring an independent candidate from the ballot if he was a member of a political party within 28 days of the last day for filing nomination papers. The court concluded that the proposed act was reasonably necessary to achieve legitimate legislative goals. The preservation of the integrity of various routes to the ballot was a proper state objective. The restrictions on independents contained in the bill were no greater than those imposed on members of political parties. Therefore, the bill did not discriminate against independent candidates.</SPAN></P>

The court found that with whatever funds the department had available, the legislature charged the department with formulating the policies, procedures, and rules necessary for the full and efficient implementation of the general relief program pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 18, &sect; 2(B)(a). The department's allocation of assistance payments among those eligible must have been on a fair, just, and equitable basis within the meaning of Mass. Gen.

Thus, the delegation to the department contained in &sect; 1 of the H.R. 6092 app. A would not have exceeded the constitutional limit. In light of the manifest purposes of the legislation and the safeguards against arbitrary decision making, the court believed that the delegation contained in &sect; 6 of H.R. 6092 app. A would not have offended the constitution of the commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the joint election of governor and lieutenant governor was authorized by the Massachusetts Constitution and that there was no showing that the House's proposed procedure would be biased or unfair. Finding that the bill at issue dealt only with primary elections, the court held that Mass. Const. Decl.

The Act generally provided for the powers of the town council and the town manager of Southbridge.

The court found that except under certain circumstances, the general court could create appointive rather than elective municipal offices.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The school, a foreign non- business corporation, was assessed real estate taxes by the Appellate Tax Board (board). The school sought an exemption from taxation as a charitable institution. The school contended that the denial of the exemption was a denial of equal protection. The court found that the state's legislative power in the realm of taxation was exceeded when a distinction was drawn between state residents over nonresidents. The court held that once a state has permitted a foreign corporation to enter and do business in the state, it could not discriminate against it in property taxation. Further, the scheme of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &sect;&sect; 8-8J permitted foreign charities to operate in Massachusetts, and subjected them to supervision and control substantially similar to that imposed on domestic corporations. Accordingly, in this case, Massachusetts had permitted foreign corporations to enter the state and did not accord equal treatment to the school solely based on the residence of the owner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants were indicted for murder after a juvenile reported that he saw defendants harassing a victim and that one defendant shot the victim with a rifle. Defendants were convicted of manslaughter. On appeal, the convictions were reversed and remanded for a new trial for a crime no greater than manslaughter. The court held that defendants' Sixth Amendment rights to confrontation were violated when they were denied access to the juvenile records of the juvenile witness. As a result of that denial, they were deprived of the privilege of cross-examination as to bias and prejudice of the witness. The witness was crucial to the prosecution, and the circumstances, including the flight of the witness from the scene, tended to support an inference that the witness's testimony might have been motivated by a desire to please the authorities. If the witness had been an adult, defendants would have had an unqualified right to the record. The trial court properly submitted the crime of manslaughter to the jury as a possible verdict.

Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24(2)(a). Defendant raised a bill of exceptions which sought to test the constitutionally of the Commonwealth's &quot;two-tier&quot; or &quot;trial de novo&quot; system under Mass. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After defendant was charged with driving to endanger in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24(2)(a), he filed a motion for a jury trial, which was denied. In a de novo proceeding tried to a jury, defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that the trial court lacked jurisdiction due to the refusal of defendant's jury request in the first instance. The trial court denied that motion. The instant bill of exceptions was brought before the court. The Commonwealth's &quot;two-tier&quot; or &quot;trial de novo&quot; system operated in that those accused of certain offenses might be tried first in a district court without a jury, and, if convicted there, might secure a fresh trial, to a jury, at the next court level under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, &sect; 18. The court overruled defendant's exceptions. The court stood by its determination in prior actions raising the same constitutional claims of a right to a speedy trial and right to a jury trial under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Mass. Declaration of rights art. 12, and the guaranty against double jeopardy provided by U.S. Const. amend V. In those actions, the court found that an opportunity for appellate review existed after the second level trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court stated that it would have granted the wife counsel fees if it had not found Rule 47 to be unconstitutional due to sex-based discrimination. Rule 47 set forth certain rules that the wife had to meet in an application for an allowance to enable her to defend or prosecute a divorce libel. On appeal, the court found that Rule 47 did not impose any significantly different burden on the wife from the burden implicitly imposed on a husband who sought an allowance for counsel fees under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, &sect; 38, which provided for awards for expenses to either party in a divorce action. The court interpreted Mass. R. Prob. Ct. 47 as intending that spouses had equal rights in similar circumstances. Even if Rule 47 was unconstitutional, the wife was still entitled to attorney fees under other statutory provisions. Thus, the wife's application for attorney fees should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A justice of the court for the County of Suffolk (Massachusetts) referred to the court an action by plaintiff utility under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 25, &sect; 5 seeking to require that defendant Department of Public Utilities (Massachusetts) allow collection of interim rates and take prompt action on permanent rates included in a rate schedule filing made by the utility and suspended by the Department under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 164, &sect; 94.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The utility claimed that the Department had failed to comply with its statutory obligations, that the Department's procedures denied it procedural due process, and that the Department's action in suspending rates had confiscated its property unconstitutionally. The court directed entry of judgment in accordance with its opinion. The court found that the Department's failure to conduct a hearing or to state its reasons for suspending the interim rates was arbitrary and constituted a denial of procedural due process, noting that the utility was constitutionally entitled to a hearing on, or an explanation of, the suspension of its filed interim rates. The court pointed out that it had ordered the Department to grant such a hearing on the interim rates or issue a statement of reasons for denying the request or both. The court observed that there was no statutory basis for appealing the portion of the order suspending permanent rates because such an order was not a final decision, order, or ruling from which an appeal could be taken and that there was no constitutional basis for invoking the court's jurisdiction on the issue of suspension of the permanent rates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court directed entry of judgment in the county court consistent with the court's opinion finding the utility entitled to a hearing on the Department's suspension of its filing of interim rates, finding no basis for appeal of the part of the Department's order suspending the utility's filing of permanent rates, and declining to stay the order suspending the interim rates.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court entered an order convicting defendant of rape, kidnapping, armed robbery, and an unnatural act, defendant appealed. On appeal, defendant argued that he was unfairly prejudiced by a newspaper article that was printed during his trial about another rape case. The headline of the newspaper article stated, &quot;judge chastises jury for rape acquittal.&quot; The court found that the trial court recognized the possibility of prejudice and promptly polled each juror regarding their thoughts about the article and even excused one juror, who it believed was prejudiced by the article.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Initially, the court determined that the city had standing as an aggrieved party under Mass. Gen.

The court held, however, that the department was not vested with the authority to order rate rebates or to implement a basic index system to effect a remedy for past inadequate telephone service. The court reasoned that the statutory grant of authority to the department to regulate and supervise a telephone company's activities did not imply the power to impose a broad system of rate rebates for inadequate service. The court held that such power had to have been expressly conferred by statute. Accordingly, the court dismissed the intervenor's plea in bar, and affirmed the department's decision.</SPAN></P>

The mother objected, stating that she wanted custody, but the probate court granted the petition, finding that it was in the best interests of the child to grant the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed. The mother contended that the probate court's application of &sect; 3 was improper and that &sect; 3 was unconstitutional. The court held that the &sect; 3 proceeding was appropriate in the case and the result was correct. The probate court had the opportunity to observe the parties close up and significantly found that the mother took an unrealistic approach to her problems and never worked out a plan to take care of herself and her child. The result would not have been any different had the analysis been conducted under the &quot;unfitness&quot; standard as the mother had proposed, rather than the &quot;best interests&quot; standard. The court found that the best interests standard was not overly vague and there was no violation of the Equal Protection Clause under &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted direct review following an interlocutory report to the Appeals Court (Massachusetts). Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment against him and the trial judge reported the case on, inter alia, the following question: Whether Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10 was unconstitutionally vague and thereby deprived defendant of due process of law in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The indictment, for a violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10, alleged that on a prior occasion defendant had been convicted of a like offense, unlawfully carrying a firearm on his person, and another offense, unlawfully carrying a knife. The statute provided that whoever, after having been convicted of certain listed offenses, committed the like offense or any other of the listed offenses, would be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not less than 5 years, for a third such offense, by imprisonment in the state prison for not less than 7 years, and for a fourth such offense, by imprisonment in the state prison for not less than 10 years. Defendant argued that &sect; 10 did not contain a maximum limit on sentences thereunder and that citizens were entitled to know the penalties for proscribed conduct. The court ruled that failure to prescribe a maximum sentence for an offense did not invalidate a statute on constitutional grounds. According to the court, this interpretation was not inconsistent with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 279, &sect; 24, for if the sentence imposed was other than for life the judge was still required to fix both a maximum and a minimum term under &sect; 24.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court ruled that the answer to the reported question was &quot;no&quot; and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was initially sentenced to death on the murder charge and concurrent life sentences on the armed robbery convictions. Subsequently, the trial judge vacated defendant's death sentence and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant shot and killed a police officer during a bank robbery. As a result, he was convicted of murder and armed robbery. Defendant was sentenced to death on the murder charge. Thereafter, the case of Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972), was decided, and defendant submitted a motion for a new trial as to the murder indictment, on the ground that the Furman case established that a death sentence could not constitutionally be imposed and, therefore, that the trial judge could not legally impose a sentence of life imprisonment or any other sentence. The trial judge denied the motion and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment as to the murder conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the jury decided that defendant was guilty of murder in the first degree and that the most severe penalty permitted by law (death) should be imposed. Since the trial judge, in subsequently vacating the death sentence and imposing a life sentence, satisfied the requirements of the Furman case, the court believed that neither a new trial nor further discussion of the issue was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's conviction of defendant. The court also affirmed the trial judge's imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment as to defendant's murder conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed the decision of the Suffolk Superior Court (Massachusetts), which convicted him of murder in the first degree in the course of armed robbery and rape and imposed a mandatory sentence of death pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was arrested for murder in the course of an armed robbery and rape. Pursuant to a jury verdict, the trial court convicted defendant of first-degree murder and imposed the mandatory death penalty. Defendant appealed. The evidence was sufficient to support the jury's finding that the murder was committed in the course of the rape based upon the tissues stuffed into the victim's mouth and the reasonable inference that it was done to still her outcries for help. There was no error in the jury charges. The court rejected defendant's assertion that the &quot;discretion&quot; analysis was applicable to his case. The charges gave the jury all possible verdicts and told them that their verdict was required to be in accordance with the evidence and the law. The court declined defendant's challenge based upon U.S. Const. amend. VIII, but it found that the right to life was a fundamental right. Because the parties had failed to brief the due process argument based upon U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 1, 10, 12, it was improper to evaluate the challenge without guidance. Thus, the court granted the parties an additional 30 days to brief the issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court allowed the parties an extra 30 days for briefing on the narrow issue of whether the State had a compelling interest which was served by the imposition of the death penalty in rape-murder cases, and whether the death penalty was the least restrictive means for furtherance of those objectives.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 58, &sect; 10C. The taxpayers' action arose after the Board recomputed the equalized valuation for the City of Boston, which resulted in its equalized value being lowered substantially.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers contended that the Board, in lowering the equalized value for Boston, applied different standards of value from those applied by the Commission in determining their equalized value.

Const. Decl. Rights arts. 10 and 11, were violated. The court found that the Commission had no power or duty to revise the taxpayers' equalized values merely because of the Board's decision with respect to Boston, reasoning that the taxpayers had the right to appeal the Commission's decision with respect their equalized values but chose not to do so. The court found that Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 58, &sect; 10C was not unconstitutional because it bore a rational relation to the legislature's objective of equalizing valuations and because it did not deny the taxpayers an opportunity to be heard regarding their own equalized valuations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Following county tax assessments made by the county commissioners, the towns filed bills seeking declaratory relief in which they questioned the propriety of the apportionment and the assessment of the taxes.

The court found the towns had standing to seek relief against the apportionment and assessment where the county taxes were assessed on the counties themselves under Mass. Gen.

Acts ch. 660, &sect; 1 for the particular tax year in question was unconstitutional pursuant to Mass. Const. art.4, &sect; 1 cl. 1, part II. The court reasoned that the assessments were based upon valuations established ten years prior and were inaccurate for purposes of apportioning taxes. The court determined that because the distribution of county taxes was based on the outdated valuation alone, it was unconstitutional and represented an arbitrary and capricious allocation of the burden of the county costs in complete disregard of principles of equality and proportion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Several individuals were convicted after a jury trial on indictments charging them with violations of various gaming laws. Upon review, the individuals argued it was error to deny their motion to suppress the contents of intercepted wire and oral communications and certain physical evidence seized on warrants based on information derived from the wiretaps. They also argued that it was error to allow admission of expert testimony, which purported to identify the individual's recorded voices through spectrographic comparisons, to hold a pre-trial voir dire hearing on the scientific reliability of voice identification by means of the voiceprint technique, where the expert witness was not available to testify before the jury at the trial, and to deny various motions of concerning pre-trial publicity related to the cases. The court held that the state statute concerning wiretapping warrants was in substantial compliance with federal law and also that the warrants issued complied with both federal and state statutory standards. Further, the court held that the jury was indifferent to pre-trial publicity and the judge's responsive measures were appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The lower court sustained the board's demurrer to the bill. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the judgment. The court determined that the litigation concerned the kind of controversy especially susceptible of resolution by a declaratory decree because it related to the board's power to adopt a rule permitting the employee's inspection. The court found that the employee was not required to join the board's chairman as a necessary party because the employee could refer to the individual members of a public body collectively by the statutory title. The court also found that the lower court could exercise jurisdiction despite the employee's failure to pursue administrative remedies because the same may have been inadequate given the fact that the authority of the board itself was in question. The court held that the board possessed the power to adopt a rule to permit the inspection because the plain meaning of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, &sect; 5 allowed such action to simplify workmen's compensation procedures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The truck driver skidded coming down a hill, crossed the center lane, and hit the van. The jury found for the van driver in his action for personal injuries, but the court reversed and granted a new trial. Although the trial court had properly denied the truck driver's motion for a directed verdict, it had been prejudicial error for the trial court to allow the van driver, who had called the truck driver as a witness, to impeach the truck driver by introducing the records of five prior convictions for motor vehicle violations. Because the court could not say that defendants might not have prevailed if the records of conviction had been excluded, the error was prejudicial enough to require a new trial. The governing statute,&nbsp;Mass Gen. Laws ch. 233, &sect; 23, provided that the party who produced a witness could not impeach him by evidence of bad character, which applied to a party who called his opponent as a witness. Because the prior convictions related to offenses similar to the tort at bar, there was an especially serious danger that the jury could have disregarded the limiting instructions and allowed the convictions to influence their deliberations as substantive evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed, sustaining the truck driver's exceptions to the trial court's judgment for the van driver in his action for personal injuries arising from an accident between the truck and the van.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Suffolk County (Massachusetts) rejected the taxpayers' challenge and the taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers were residents of the Commonwealth who were domiciled in municipalities other than the Town, but owned a dwelling in the Town where they resided temporarily during the summer season.

The taxpayers argued that such tax violated the Massachusetts constitutional principle of proportional taxation and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The court found that the statutory distinction between household furniture and effects kept in or near a person's domicil, and those that were not, was reasonable and not productive of unconstitutional disproportionality. All taxpayers were equal in that they were entitled to the exemption for the furnishings and effects in their domiciles. The court found a rational basis in a tax applicable to household furniture and effects located in a summer residence, but not applicable to such property located in one's domicil.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to the jury verdict, the superior court convicted defendant of second degree murder. Defendant appealed. The court ordered direct appellate review and affirmed. Even though, the language of Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 234, &sect; 28 spoke in terms of individual jurors, the superior court correctly determined that individual questioning was not required because the jury no longer had to apply the death penalty. There was no evidence that the failure to interrogate the jurors under oath was prejudicial, therefore, the error was harmless. The repeated calls regarding the clothing were admissible to show consciousness of guilt. Defendant was not entitled to a directed verdict. The experts' dispute over the cause of death was a jury question. The circumstantial evidence was sufficient.

Laws ch. 279, &sect; 5 because the murder was committed after a United States Supreme Court decision declaring that the death penalty violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court ruled, however, that although the trial court erred when it inquired whether the potential jurors were adverse to the death penalty, the trial court properly reserved the issue for judicial review, and defendant did not show that he was deprived of a jury that could have fairly and objectively determined his guilt or innocence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The officers alleged that the application of &sect; 10 to them would be unconstitutional. The court, however, denied the officers relief and declared &sect; 10 constitutional. The court held that although Mass. Gen.

The court further held that because the officers did not have a vested right in continued employment until age 70, &sect; 10 did not deny them due process. Finally, the court held that because of the physical demands that were involved in the officers' job, the state's classification scheme for retirement purposes was reasonable and did not deprive the officers of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The bill challenged the constitutionality of 1971 Mass. Acts ch. 1080, passed for the exclusive benefit of the respondent hospital and intervenor hospital.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The hospitals sought to expand their facilities. At approximately the same time, the legislature passed ch. 1080, to prevent unnecessary expansion of health care facilities that required a determination by the Department of Public Health (department) of need. The department made an adverse finding as to the respondent and a partially adverse finding as to the intervenor. Each hospital sought and obtained legislation allowing their planned expansion notwithstanding ch. 1080, and the Commissioner challenged the constitutionality of the legislation. The court upheld the constitutionality, finding that singular exceptions to or exemptions from existing laws were permitted because they did no harm to the interest of any individual or entity. The court also found that the laws did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment or the standing laws provision of Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 10. In passing the laws for the benefit of the hospitals, the legislature was not exercising nonlegislative powers where there is no injury to any private rights.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the challenged prohibition was not unreasonable or arbitrary and that it had a real and substantial relation to the object of protecting workers. The court observed that working conditions in the construction industry differed substantially from those existing in other industries; hence, the court held that prohibiting the use of stilts in construction work while allowing their use in other industries was not irrational.</SPAN></P>

The Commission sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The lower court's reversal was based on its conclusion that the Commission erred in basing its decision on a determination that an indefinite suspension was not proper. The court agreed that the basis of the Commission's decision was wrong. However, the court disagreed with the lower court's disposition of the case, reversed the lower court's decision, and remanded the case to the Commission. The court found that the policeman's suspension was required by statute to rest on just cause. Further, the Commission was charged with the duty of deciding whether such cause existed. However, the court found that the Commission did not decide the issue of whether the board suspended the policeman for just cause. Instead, the Commission skirted this issue, took refuge in a technical point, and determined that an indefinite suspension was an inappropriate punishment. On certiorari, the lower court made its own independent finding of just cause for the suspension, which went beyond the lower court's proper sphere of review. Accordingly, the court held that reversal and remand to the Commission was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Although the federal consent decree required the state's towns and cities to certify the applicants for police officer positions with consideration to minority applicants who failed earlier entrance examinations but passed the 1972 exam and were qualified, the state law provided for the priority of city or town residents who were disabled veterans, then veterans, then residents, then nonresident disabled veterans, and so forth. Upholding the assertion by the towns and cities that only a three-judge federal court could enjoin the enforcement of a state statute that was challenged on constitutional grounds, the court declined to resolve the issues and elected to await the decision of the appropriate federal court. The federal court would then resolve the issues concerning the validity and effect of its consent decrees as applied to the towns and cities that were affected by the decree subsequent to its entry. In the interim, the court held that the cities and towns should give initial effect to the decree and, within each group, give effect to the state law.</SPAN></P>

The predecessor paid a use tax on the vessel. The taxpayer applied for an abatement of the tax paid, which was denied. The taxpayer's appeal to the appellate tax board also failed. On appeal to the court, the taxpayer asserted that the use tax was unconstitutional because of its discriminatory effect on interstate commerce. The court agreed with the taxpayer's contention and reversed. Vessels such as the one purchased by the taxpayer's predecessor were exempt from sales tax under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 64H if they were manufactured within the commonwealth. On the other hand, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 64I imposed a use tax on similar vessels that were brought into the state from elsewhere. The use tax could validly be applied so long as it did not place a higher burden on out-of-state equipment than was placed on domestic equipment. As the commonwealth's use tax applied to vessels not covered by the sales tax, interstate commerce was improperly burdened.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court had previously affirmed an order of defendant state board of education (board) which directed plaintiff school committee (committee) to implement a plan designed to achieve racial balance in the school system. After 1974 Mass. Stat. ch. 636 was enacted, the committee filed a motion to vacate on the basis that ch. 636 had removed the committee's authority to utilize certain means required to carry out the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the court reviewed the lengthy history of efforts to achieve racial balance in the school system, it denied the motion and reaffirmed its prior orders. The court noted that when the committee, pursuant to the orders of the board and of the court, proceeded to implement the racial balancing plan, it in effect created a new status quo in which every elementary school was racially balanced. The court held that any action which would tend to reverse or impede these efforts in the school system would constitute resegregation and would thus be an act of de jure segregation in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and of Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights arts. 1 and 10. This was so without regard to whether the efforts so reversed or impeded were constitutionally required in the first place, or whether there had ever been a finding of de jure segregation in the school system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's conviction was based on evidence that defendant forced the victim to commit an act of fellatio on him and to put her tongue on his backside. On appeal, defendant claimed that the prohibition against committing an unnatural and lascivious act was unconstitutionally vague, that the trial judge failed to give the jury an adequate description of what constituted an unnatural and lascivious act and whether consent barred conviction, and that the prosecutor made improper prejudicial remarks. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that &sect; 35 was sufficiently specific to overcome a constitutional challenge because it contained words of common usage that indicated with reasonable clarity the kind and character of conduct the legislature intended to prohibit. The court determined that the sexual conduct referred to in the statute was limited to conduct which virtually all members of the community regarded as offensive. The court further held that defendant's challenges to the jury instructions were waived because defendant failed to raise them at trial, and that the trial judge had promptly protected defendant's interests at the time of the prosecutor's remarks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The victim was raped and robbed after permitting two men to accompany her upstairs for a drink of water. Later, the victim and her husband noticed defendant and another man who they identified as the assailants. The two men were arrested but charges against the other man were dropped because of a mistaken identification. After conviction, defendant appealed and the court reversed. The court held that the trial judge erroneously excluded cross-examination questions about the mistaken identification. The court held that such cross-examination, while technically a collateral matter, was central to the identification of defendant and should have been permitted. The court further held that the failure of the juvenile court to file written reasons for the dismissal of the complaint was not error. The improper questioning of two defense witnesses was reversible error, but the issue was not preserved for appeal. The trial court properly instructed the jury that they might draw a negative inference from the failure to call other witnesses because such inferences were permitted in limited circumstances within the discretion of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff had been tried in the district court for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and he had not pursued his appeal to the superior court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Before plaintiff's trial in district court, he filed a written motion for a trial by jury, which was denied. He was found guilty and appealed to the superior court, but did not pursue the appeal. Plaintiff asked the court declare that the two-trial de novo procedure was unconstitutional and to enjoin the Commonwealth from further prosecuting the complaint. The petition was dismissed. The court held that the petition could not be maintained as an application for an interlocutory appeal or as a petition for the exercise of the court's extraordinary powers under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211, &sect; 3. By reason of his failure to appear when his case was called in the superior court, plaintiff was not entitled to appellate relief from the court even if such relief were otherwise available. Considering the merits of the constitutional issue, the court found that the Commonwealth's two-tier system satisfied the jury trial requirement of the Sixth Amendment as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. A defendant not only gave up nothing by going to trial in the district court, but he gained the advantage of a preview of the prosecution's case without having to disclose his own.</SPAN></P>

Acts 842, &sect; 3, and attorney fees and costs plus liquidated damages of three times the amount of the security deposit. The court reversed a superior court decision affirming a judgment for the landlord, remanded the matter for further proceedings, and found that, on the question of whether the landlord received rent in excess of the maximum rent allowed under the act, the stipulation of facts in the trial court omitted significant information concerning the action of a rent regulatory agency. The tenant relied on some of the omitted information and, if it had been in the stipulation, the landlord might have pressed for the inclusion of additional explanatory facts. The court ruled that justice would be served best by permitting the tenant to rely on administrative events outside the stipulation, provided the landlord was given the right to offer additional evidence, and therefore the court set aside the stipulation and remanded the case to the superior court.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) &sect; 129 was rationally related to the valid legislative purpose of determining the type and severity of punishments that were to be meted out for various crimes; (2) the separate treatment of some sex offenders in &sect; 129 was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose; and (3) merely because the legislature permitted the award of good conduct credit to persons convicted of, for example, inducing a person under 18 years of age to engage in sexual intercourse, the Equal Protection Clause did not require the legislature to permit such credit to those convicted for rape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court in Essex County (Massachusetts), which convicted him after a jury trial of murder in the second degree for the homicide of his wife. In his appeal pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, &sect;&sect; 33A- 33G, he asserted six grounds for reversal. Four related to evidentiary rulings by the trial judge. The others alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction and a violation of his right to a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of murdering his wife in 1966 and disposing of her remains in the ocean. Before their discovery the couple was believed to have perished in a storm at sea. More than two years later defendant reappeared in Nevada claiming to be an amnesia victim. He was tried and convicted in 1973. The court affirmed, rejecting his claim that he was denied a speedy trial as he and his counsel were primarily responsible for most of the delay. An expert's challenged testimony was based on a mode of identifying human remains that had since been approved in an intervening decision. Defendant was informed of his Miranda rights and waived them before he made statements he now claimed should have been suppressed. The court held that the statements were voluntarily given and thus properly admitted. The court also rejected defendant's challenge to the admission of a divorce libel filed by the wife the month of her disappearance, holding that it was admissible to establish her state of mind, which was relevant to the location of the murder and hence the court's jurisdiction. The circumstantial evidence supported an inference that the murder was within the state's territorial limits.</SPAN></P>

After proper notice was give to other property owners, respondent apartment building owners opposed the petition contending petitioner's plan to build a 12-story hotel-apartment building violated the restrictions. The court reversed the trial court's final decree which had held that respondents had no rights to any damages. The court held that Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 184, &sect; 30, which allowed for the removal of restrictions on petitioners' parcel, was constitutionally applied, as the evidence showed that the public interest would not be served by the enforcement of the restrictions. The court held that the restrictions would not be specifically enforced, as the properties and neighborhood had drastically changed and because the restrictions would impede reasonable use of the land. A balance of the equities and a consideration of public interest required that respondents accept money damages by way of enforcement of the restriction. The court remanded the cause to determine damages for loss of benefit in light and air.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court was asked to provide a judicial opinion as to the constitutionality of a bill repealing the exemption of the Massachusetts Port Authority (Authority) from local property taxes. The court opined that the subject bill, House No. 5541, suffered from no facial constitutional problems, and further noted that tax exemptions previously granted may be repealed. The court stated that the bill would not violate U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 by impairing the rights of bondholders through the imposition of local taxes on property held as security for the bonds. Even if the taxes resulted in a reduction in revenue, this would not cause a substantial impairment of the bondholders' contract. Further, Mass. Gen. Stat. ch. &sect; 17 did not allow a perpetual tax exemption on which the bondholders could reasonably rely, as contracts of tax exemptions are valid only if limited to a reasonable period of time. The repeal of the lessees' property tax exemption would not abrogate any express term of the Authority's leases. Finally, the court cautioned that its opinion was advisory only, and that if the same questions arose in litigation, the issues would have to be considered de novo.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court opined that the subject bill was not unconstitutional, was within the power of the legislature, and would not impair valid contractual rights of lessees or bondholders.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The cities brought an action seeking injunctive relief and a declaration that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 226 (1972) was constitutional. The new statute required the director of the Civil Service Commission to give higher placement to residents of one year or more on lists of eligible applicants for appointment to the police force. The trial court held that ch. 226 was constitutional in its entirety and ordered compliance therewith. The court affirmed on appeal. The court held that the denial of equal treatment on civil service lists for possible appointment to the local police force did not rise to the level of a denial of the necessities of life or of a fundamental political right. As the statute did not constitute a penalty on the &quot;right to travel,&quot; it need not have been justified by a compelling state interest. The court noted that even under the traditional Equal Protection standards, the statute was not &quot;arbitrary or irrational&quot; and bore a reasonable relation to the legitimate public interest of providing the best police protection for the towns involved, given the heightened knowledge of a place that its residents possess.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &sect;&sect; 2, 3. The court found that it was both normal and reasonable to draw boundaries between districts with regard to the placement of major traffic arteries, which had considerable effect on the appropriate uses of adjacent property. The district lines had to be drawn somewhere, and the landowner had no legitimate complaint based on the fact that her property straddled such a line. The court rejected the landowner's equal protection argument regarding the exclusion of apartments under the by-law, finding that it was without substance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought review of a decision from the superior court (Massachusetts), which convicted defendant of unlawful possession of a hypodermic needle, unlawful possession of a hypodermic syringe, unlawful possession of heroin, and assault with intent to rob while armed with a dangerous weapon. After hearings in the juvenile court, juvenile complaints against him were dismissed and criminal complaints were issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was 15 years and 11 months when arrested. The juvenile court had found probable cause and bound defendant over for the grand jury. Defendant was later indicted for 14 offenses. The case and two other cases involving the same defendant raised questions as to the procedure for binding over a juvenile from the juvenile court for trial as an adult in the superior court. On appeal, the court held that the proceedings in the juvenile court were not subject to Mass. Dist. Ct. R. 85, as adopted March 4, 1969, and that statutory and constitutional requirements were met. The court held that before criminal proceedings could be begun against a child between 14 and 17 years of age, juvenile proceedings against him had to be begun and dismissed under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, &sect;&sect; 52, 61, 74, as amended. The procedure was followed and the judge of the juvenile court made the finding required by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, &sect; 61.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant town appealed from an interlocutory decree and a final decree of the Superior Court (Massachusetts), which, overruled its demurrer to plaintiff market owner's bill in equity seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, declared Mass. Gen. Laws art. XI, &sect;&sect; 17, 17A invalid, and dismissed the town's counterclaim for a decree of their validity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The market owner changed the closing hour of his market from midnight until 10:00 p.m. to comply with Mass. Gen. Laws art. XI, &sect;&sect; 17, 17A, which barred the sale of food at retail between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. The owner challenged the constitutionality of the by-laws on the grounds that they exceeded the powers granted to the town by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40, &sect; 21(1). The town appealed the superior court's declaration that the by-laws were invalid. Upon finding that the town's demurrer was properly overruled, the court held that the adoption of the by-laws was within the powers granted the town by &sect; 21(1). The by-laws did not deny the owner its due process or equal protection rights under the state or federal constitutions because the by-laws were clearly intended to protect the nighttime tranquility of a largely residential community from the excessive light and noise of a market. There was a rational basis to exempt establishments run by holders of a common victualer's license from the by-laws because the licensed establishments primarily sold food for consumption on their premises and were less likely to disturb the residents than a market.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the superior court's interlocutory decree, reversed the final decree, and remanded the case to the superior court for the entry of a new decree that the challenged town by-laws were valid and could be enforced.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 233, &sect; 20B applied to communications between a person under custody as a sexually dangerous person and a psychiatrist appointed by the court. For the psychiatrist's testimony to be admissible, the court ruled, the psychiatrist was required to inform defendant that any communication was not privileged.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws. ch. 15, &sect;&sect; 1I, 1J.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the board entered the order to achieve racial balance in the city's elementary school system, the school committee and the education committee appealed. The court overruled the school committee's demurrer to the board's counterclaim, dismissed the suit, affirmed the board's order, and required timely compliance. Substantial evidence supported the board's determination that the proposed plan was a safe one. A finding that the proposed plan conformed to a neighborhood district standard was supported by substantial evidence. The board acted properly in ruling that the plan submitted by the school committee was substantively inadequate. The court dismissed the education committee's suit. The court doubted that the education committee had standing to assert what it claimed to be the interests of the Puerto Rican community. The educational committee had to show either that it would itself have been harmed by enforcement of the plan or that it represented a class of persons which would have been harmed. It showed neither. No basis was shown for a finding that the concentration of Puerto Ricans in some schools constituted de jure segregation in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded the education committee's suit to the justice to dismiss the suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff teachers brought a declaratory action against defendants, school committee and superintendent of schools (school), contending that the school's policy with respect to maternity leave was unconstitutional. The Superior Court of Middlesex County (Massachusetts) entered judgment for the teachers. The school appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The school had a maternity policy mandating that teachers &quot;resign&quot; after their fourth month of pregnancy, and forego sick pay. The policy also provided for reinstatement six months after birth, subject to available vacancy. The court held that such policy violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it penalized the pregnant teachers for deciding to bear a child and placed a heavy burden on their freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life. Further, the court noted that under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2000e-2000e-15, mandatory maternity leave policies were prima facie invalid, and that maternity leave must have been treated like any other leave for temporary disability. Arguments for the policy, such that it created administrative convenience, were not weighty enough to validate the prejudicial scheme. Further, the policy did not further continuity of instruction for students, but frustrated it. As such, the school was liable to the teachers for back pay and bore the burden to prove that the teachers could have returned to work and mitigated their losses.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 272, &sect; 32 for knowingly showing a lewd, obscene, indecent, immoral and impure show and entertainment. Defendants were found guilty on each indictment and appealed. The court reversed defendant's convictions because of a holding in another case that same day to the effect that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 28A, was unconstitutionally vague. The court noted that the same reasoning traditionally applied to violations of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 32 and further held that the verdict under Mass. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, as the acting governor, requested an advisory opinion relating to a bill, H.R. 5495 (Mass. 1974), pending before him. The bill proposed an act placing the issue of public school pupil reassignment on the ballot of a special election to be held in a city. The lieutenant governor had doubts as to the constitutionality of certain provisions of the bill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The bill provided for a certain question to be placed on a ballot for a special municipal election to be held in the city. The question regarded whether the city's public school children should be assigned to a particular city public school on the basis of race, sex, or creed without the consent of his parent or legal guardian. The lieutenant governor asked whether the bill would have violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV or the state constitution. The court found that the bill was unconstitutional on its face because it served to perpetuate existing segregation in some of the schools, regardless of its cause, and, thus, significantly encouraged and involved the state in racial discrimination. The bill, if enacted, would have violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights arts. 1, 10.By barring assignment of pupils on the basis of race, the bill would have ensured the perpetuation of existing racial imbalance in the city's schools.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners asserted that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, &sect;&sect; 4-5, which required a person to be a resident of Massachusetts for two years before a libel for divorce could be filed was unconstitutional because it violated their rights of due process and equal protection. Each of petitioners was married out of the state and moved to Massachusetts only after the cause of the divorce had occurred elsewhere. The divorce court refused to accept the libel since the alleged causes of divorce occurred outside of the state. The court determined that the two-year residence requirement operated to classify Massachusetts' domiciliaries into two groups based on length of residence and to treat the groups differently. It held that the residency requirement was unconstitutional, at the very least, as violative of the Equal Protection Clause. The residency requirement was too imprecise a means for accomplishing the goal of restricting the state's divorces to its legitimate domiciliaries. The court granted the petition.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the method of selection of the nine-member commission was constitutionally defective as it provided for a power of appointment in the judicial department and purely legislative officers.

There was no abuse its discretion in denying defendant's pretrial motion for the production of a police journal and police teletypes describing the robbers broadcast shortly after the robbery. The police had properly seized a gun that was in plain view.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The union picketed the supermarkets with the object of inducing customers to stop patronizing the stores. A single justice of the court of appeals annulled preliminary injunctions and entered a stay of the annulment pending appeal. The court vacated the stay, annulled the preliminary injunctions, and remanded for proceedings in compliance with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 212, &sect; 30 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, &sect; 9A. The court held the preliminary injunctions were jurisdictionally improper because procedural safeguards were required before injunctions were issued in any case that involved or grew out of a labor dispute. The controversy involved disputants who did not stand in a relation of employer-employee. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 20C(c) included situations where a union applied pressure to another in a secondary controversy, in the hope that pressure would be applied to the adversary in the primary dispute. The failure to summon a three-judge court, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 212, &sect; 30, and provide the procedural safeguards of a hearing and findings of fact, under Mass. Gen.

The court held that the trial court acted within its discretion by undertaking an out-of-state view and that not allowing defendant to attend did not violate his right to confrontation because a view did not involve the kind of evidence subject to that right. The court also found proper a ruling that defendant produce his footwear for the purposes of matching it to footprints where the body was discovered. The court noted that defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated because he was in prison at the time the production was requested and because a complete adversary hearing was held prior to issuance of the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The voters claimed that the vote should have been invalidated because the town's charter commission violated certain provisions of the Act regarding procedures to be followed in the adoption of a home rule charter.

A failure by the commission to comply with financial accounting requirements under &sect; 8(a) was not a basis to invalidate the vote. The ballot summary of the charter complied with &sect; 11.

The trial court declared a mistrial on the counts of the indictment against defendant for rape, confinement against the victim's will, and assault by means of a dangerous weapon when the jury reported an inability to reach verdicts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant offered to give a ride to his victim, who was walking in the rain and snow from a subway station to her apartment.

The victim caught the attention of the police while she was in the car, and the police discovered a knife in defendant's pocket and the broken door handle. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court properly instructed the jury, and defense counsel had not requested instructions on the issues of &quot;privacy&quot; or &quot;consent.&quot; Defendant did not have standing to challenge &sect; 35 as overly broad, and could not invoke the rights of others in his contention that &sect; 35 was an unconstitutional restriction of the right to privacy.

The court on appeal discharged petitioner from the custody of respondent because the district court had no jurisdiction to try him. The court observed that under the circumstances, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, &sect; 75 required the district court to commit or bind petitioner over for trial in the superior court. Addressing possible future proceedings, the court held that the general standard expressed in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, &sect; 61 was an adequate guide to the carrying out of the judicial function of declining juvenile jurisdiction. The trial of petitioner upon the adult complaint did not put him twice in jeopardy as the dismissal of the juvenile complaint and the issuance of the adult complaint was one event as contemplated by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, &sect; 75. Proper treatment of petitioner called for a hearing on the question of dismissal of the delinquency complaint and adequate notice thereof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Three questions were certified to the court relative to the construction of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B. The court determined that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B did not apply to a contract which antedated its enactment. The court found that ch. 93B was enacted three years after the parties entered into the contract and that application of the chapter to the contract would substantially revise the relationships between the parties. The court determined that because there was nothing to indicate that the legislature intended for ch. 93B to have retroactive effect, its application was prospective only. The court held that ch. 93B applied to the dealership agreement between the parties because the distributor had the power to accept orders for the construction of vehicles mounted on wheels even though the only vehicles supplied by the manufacturer to the distributor were mounted on treads and not wheels.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that Mass. Gen. Law ch. 176A (1972) did not require nonparticipating hospitals to accept payments from a specific insurer as payments in full for services performed for subscribers. The statute only provided that hospital service corporations could enter into contracts with hospitals, and it was those contracts that explicitly defined the obligations between the insurer and its subscribers. The legislature intended to preserve the preexisting relationship between nonparticipating hospitals and the insurer. The court held that a hospital, having accepted payment from the insurer, had acceded to the condition that it not seek further payment directly from the subscriber. The phrase &quot;guarantee of payments,&quot; found in ch. 176A, placed an obligation on hospitals to continue the same guarantee of benefits found in the predecessor statute.</SPAN></P>

The nursing homes contended that they were irrational, discriminatory, and confiscatory, that the legislative rate freeze under &sect; 6 was unconstitutional, and the nursing homes opposed its retroactive application. A master's report concluded that the rate freeze, which only applied to skilled nursing homes, was irrational or improperly discriminatory, and that regulations based on the computation of 100 percent occupancy were unfair and unreasonable. The court decreed that the regulations were validly adopted by the commission in the interest of uniform treatment of nursing homes with different policies and that &sect; 6 was not unconstitutionally applied to the nursing homes. The court held that: (1) the federal constitution interposed no barrier to retroactive redetermination of provisional or tentative rates; and that (2) &sect; 6 excluded unskilled nursing homes because they were not eligible to render services under the Medicaid program and excluded inpatient hospital services because they were excluded by federal law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed and the court affirmed, holding that despite its circumstantial nature, the evidence gave rise to reasonable and possible inferences supportive of the jury's verdict, including testimony that defendant and the victim were seen leaving a party holding hands and that the victim's roommates heard noises at the time of the offense in the apartment where the victim's body was found. The court found that the physical evidence, including bloodstains, also pointed to defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court determined that the exclusion of persons under 22 years old from the jury was not prejudicial to defendant and that certain remarks made by the prosecutor in his closing argument, while possibly improper, were neither objected to by defendant nor made part of a request for special instructions to the jury, and thus the trial court acted properly in not striking the remarks or mitigating their impact.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Earlier, upon a charge against the inmate in Puerto Rico a fugitive complaint was entered against him resulting in his arrest and after a number of continuances, the complaint was dismissed for want of prosecution. The inmate held his status as a putative violator of probation was known to Puerto Rico and the Commonwealth, a Puerto Rican court issued a warrant for his arrest for the violation, and that charges should have been combined in the attempt to extradite. There was a decision not to combine so the prosecution should have been &quot;estopped&quot; from using it some two years later as a basis for the present, second effort to extradite. The Commonwealth asserted that the facts recounted were not a ground for relief on habeas corpus. The judge's report put the question of &quot;estoppel&quot; to the court. On appeal, the court dismissed the report as technically defective because the issue had not been decided but merely sent directly to the court. But the court did hold that because of the preliminary character of an extradition hearing, it was like a probable cause hearing and the charges could be dismissed only to be reinstated at a later date and therefore estoppel did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A corporation filed suit challenging the enactment of a by-law which required the corporation to obtain a permit for the continuing operation of its gravel pits. The corporation contended that its gravel pits operation was a nonconforming use under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &sect; 5, not subject to the by-law, and that a contrary interpretation would violate the corporation's due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court denied the corporation declaratory and injunctive relief and concluded that the by-law, adopted pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40, &sect; 21(17), was not subject to the zoning enabling statute, and as adopted, the by-law did not deny the corporation of property without due process of law. The court found that the municipality was authorized by &sect; 21(17) to adopt by-laws for prohibiting or regulating the removal of soil, loam, sand or gravel from land not in public use in the whole or specified districts of the municipality. The statute enabled the municipality to regulate the removal of soil, loam, sand and gravel without setting upon any zoning system. As such, the challenged statute, adopted under chapter 40 rather than chapter 40A, was not a zoning by-law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied the corporation declaratory and injunctive relief against the municipality and entered a decree declaring that the municipality's by-law, requiring a permit for the continuing operation of gravel pits, was not subject to the zoning enabling statute and did not deprive the corporation of property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion for new trial, which was based on an alleged violation of the Bruton rule. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of the motion because the spontaneous utterance testimony of two witnesses was properly admitted against defendant as an exception to the hearsay rule, and had not violated the Bruton rule. The court also held that defendant had failed to preserve three additional errors that were known to him at the time of trial. Additionally, there was no abuse of trial court discretion to review because the trial court had not acted on the three errors. Furthermore, there was no error in the earlier denial of a motion to inspect grand jury minutes in the absence of a particularized need and where defendant had waived his right of appeal on the issue. He could not resurrect the issue under the guise of a motion for new trial. However, because of an intervening change in the law the court reversed defendant's death sentence and remanded for imposition of a life sentence.</SPAN></P>

The city contended that the provisions only applied to employees who were not civil servants. The supreme judicial court reserved decision and reported the bill by a single justice without decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of rape and murder, and the court affirmed the convictions but vacated the death sentence for the murder and ordered that he be resentenced to imprisonment for life. First, defendant was not prejudiced by the testimony of two witnesses regarding defendant's approximate age. One witness's testimony was merely cumulative, since other witnesses testified to his age. The other's &quot;best estimate&quot; of defendant's age was an impression from observations, the strength and exactness of which had been tested before the jury. Second, the imposition of the death penalty was invalid because Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 119, &sect;&sect; 61, 74, 75, 83 left it within the discretion of the trial court, despite the mandatory language of Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 265, &sect; 2. However, the United States Supreme Court had determined that such discretionary statutes were unconstitutional in their operation, as they allowed for discrimination, which was not compatible with the idea of equal protection of the laws that was implicit in the ban on cruel and unusual punishments. Apart from that, the court concluded that the defendant received a fair trial, and the evidence of his guilt was overwhelming.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by refusing to allow defendants to make unsworn statements to the jury. The court held that the Tuey charge was properly phrased and given, but recommended changes in the charge to correct the misstatement that the case must at some time be decided by a jury and to invite members of the tentative majority to reconsider their position in light of the views of the tentative minority as well as inviting the minority to reconsider their position in light of the majority's views.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">At defendant's preliminary hearing on charges of, inter alia, rape, the trial judge ended the hearing after only the direct testimony of the complaining witness and half of the cross-examination of that witness. The trial judge stated that he had heard enough testimony to find probable cause and that further cross-examination by defendant's counsel was, thus, unnecessary. Defendant claimed that his substantive rights were violated, and the Commonwealth contended that ch. 276, &sect; 38 should not be interpreted as granting defendant an absolute &quot;inflexible&quot; right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses. The court rejected the Commonwealth's argument that once a prima facie showing of probable cause had been made by prosecution testimony, the examining magistrate could end the hearing before defendant's attorney had an opportunity to make a complete cross-examination of the prosecution witness or to present an affirmative defence. The court held that ch. 276, &sect; 38 granted defendant a mandatory right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses and present testimony before a determination of probable cause.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state senate sought an advisory opinion as to whether a proposed amendment to two sections of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 56 (1973) violated U.S. Const. amend. I and Mass. Const. art. XVI, as amended by art. LXXVII, and whether the proposed attempt to regulate political advertising constituted interference with or prior restraint on the freedom of the press. The court entered an opinion finding that the answer to both questions as applied to proposed &sect; 39A of House Bill No. 3460 was &quot;yes,&quot; holding that if a newspaper or other publication of general circulation published a paid political advertisement, it was a violation of federal and state constitutional protections accorded to the press to compel that publication to publish paid political advertisements espousing a contrary view without a substantial and overriding governmental interest in all such advertisements being published. As to proposed &sect; 39B, the court held that the amendment would survive a constitutional challenge on free press grounds because it dealt exclusively with a commercial aspect of the operation of a newspaper or other periodical, included no compulsion to publish, and merely balanced advertising rates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Governor submitted a request for an advisory opinion. House No. 6657 provided that no child attending public school could be transported to or from any public school without the prior written consent of his parent or legal guardian. Each child was to be permitted to attend the school nearest his residence within his city or town, which had a seat available in his grade, unless his attendance at another school had been requested by his parent or legal guardian. The court assessed the historical context, immediate objective, and potential impact of the legislation and determined that the State had adopted a position of encouragement of and involvement with private racial discrimination. The court decided that the legislation was an unconstitutional violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and of Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights arts. 1, 10.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The victim had been shot. The victim was taken to the hospital where in two separate interviews by police officers he identified defendant as the person who shot him. The Commonwealth's also presented admissions of guilt made by defendant to two inmates at a state hospital to which defendant was committed for observation. On appeal, the court found that statements made to police officers by the victim were properly admitted as dying declarations. There was sufficient evidence to permit first the trial judge and then the jury, on proper instructions, to find that the condition existed which made the victim's statements admissible. The victim's statement to his father that he was dying and wanted to go home warranted a finding that he had abandoned any hope of being saved by medical care and wished to go home to die. There was no denial to defendant of the effective assistance of counsel. Defense counsel's closing argument, when viewed in the context of the entire trial, showed that defense counsel's actions fell far short of descending to that level of ineffectiveness which constituted an unconstitutional denial of a criminal defendant's right to counsel.</SPAN></P>

The city assessed the taxpayer's property at a higher percentage of fair cash value than it assessed real estate in 1971. The taxpayer paid the tax under protest. The taxpayer brought suit, contending that the assessment resulted in an illegal excess pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 59, &sect; 82. The city demurred on the ground that unless a tax was entirely void, an action in a contract was not available and the taxpayer would have to resort to abatement procedures. The taxpayer contended that an action in contract was available to recover excessive illegal taxes. The trial court granted the city's demurrer. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the taxpayer could not maintain an action under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 60, &sect; 98, where the declaration did not allege that the tax was void but only excessive and where there were no specific allegations of fact that would serve to support a conclusion that the tax was void; and (2) the taxpayer's exclusive remedy to secure an adjustment was by abatement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff nonprofit tenants' corporation filed a bill in equity seeking an injunction with respect to alleged substandard physical conditions at a Boston housing development in the Superior Court (Massachusetts). Defendant Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs (DCA) and Boston Housing Authority (BHA) filed demurrers. The trial court sustained the demurrers and entered a final decree dismissing the bill. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The nonprofit tenants' corporation sought an injunction against DCA and BHA with respect to alleged substandard physical conditions at a state-aided, low-rent Boston housing development. After the DCA and BHA filed demurrers, the trial court entered interlocutory decrees sustaining the demurrers without leave to amend. The court later entered a final decree dismissing the bill. On appeal, the court held that the suit's object appeared to be an attempt to have the superior court declare and enforce by continuing injunction, DCA and BHA obligations to maintain the development. The court held that the statute setting forth the responsibilities of the two agencies did not authorize judicial intervention under the circumstances. The court held that the bill did not set forth facts that would bring the matter within the jurisdiction of the court and affirmed the interlocutory and final decrees entered by the trial court. The court noted that, while this action was pending, DCA issued regulations for tenant participation and grievances that might be of assistance to the corporation, and also noted that the legislature created a statutory housing court with concurrent jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the interlocutory and final decrees entered by the superior court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The store had never entered into a fair trade contract with the manufacturer.

The court held the nonsigner provision amounted to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to private parties. To this extent, the court overruled the decision in General Elec. Co. v. Kimball Jewelers, Inc., 333 Mass. 665, which had held that the Fair Trade Law was constitutional. The court stated that there was no provision in the law for participation by any public board or officer in the process by which the manufacturer fixed the prices. The court found that the statute was not limited to situations where most retailers participated voluntarily or where the nonsigner provision applied to few retailers. The court found that the manufacturer had no property interest in the glassware acquired by the store and that a resale was a sale by the store of its own property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Two actions came before the court on reservations from the Probate Court for the county of Suffolk (Massachusetts). Petitioner trustees sought instructions as to whether there could be an abatement of the estate taxes paid, pursuant to Mass. Gen.. Laws ch. 65A, &sect; 1, for the transfer of intangible personal property of persons who had died as residents of foreign countries or states.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">One case involved the intangible assets of a citizen of the U.S. and &quot;a resident and domiciliary&quot; of Italy taxed under I.R.C. &sect; 2011 (1954 ) (as amended through 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2011 (1970)). The executor argued that under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution it was impermissible for the commonwealth to impose any tax on the intangible assets held in Massachusetts brokerage accounts and in a Massachusetts bank. The other case involved the transfer of the assets held by the trustees of an inter vivos trust following the death of the settlor and the tax under I.R.C. &sect; 2101 (1954) (as amended through 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2101 (1970)). The trustee argued discrimination between non-residents living in other countries and those living in other states. The court held that: 1) Mass. Gen.. Laws ch. 65A, &sect; 1 properly imposed a state tax on inheritances; 2) intangible assets were subject to the taxes of the state in which they were held and; 3) states were allowed to impose these &quot;sponge&quot; taxes, for the out of state residents there was no double tax, and the tax merely took some of the money otherwise paid to the federal government and gave it to the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that in both cases there would be no abatement of the estate taxes paid to the commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

The three defendants joined in a bill of exceptions on the trial court's denial of motions for a directed verdict, for a new trial, for leave reserved, and for other errors during the trial. Due to defendant driver and defendant owner's failure to support their exceptions with a brief, the court dismissed their bills and allowed judgment to be entered against them. As for the other defendant, the agent, the court found numerous prejudicial errors in the trial judge's evidence rulings, errors in the instructions to jury, and a failure to cure unfair tactics employed by plaintiff's counsel.

The inmates were sentenced to two years in the house of correction for the violation of &sect; 17 concerning horses (the first indictments) and separate fines for the violations of &sect; 17 concerning dogs and baseball games (the second and third indictments). After payment of the fines, the inmates filed applications for writs of error contending that there was only one violation of &sect; 17 and that they should be discharged from custody. The court sustained the inmates' exceptions to the single justice's orders denying the issuance of writs of error. The court reversed the trial court's judgments of sentences on the first indictments. The court ruled that the same crime was charged in the first and second indictments and that the inmates were subjected to double jeopardy by the joint pendency of those indictments and by their convictions thereunder. The court ruled that the inmates could not properly have been subjected to both imprisonment and a fine. The court concluded that the inmates should not have been remanded to the custody of the sheriff after payment of the fines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, Secretary of the Commonwealth and intervenors, sought review of an order in the Suffolk Superior Court (Massachusetts) in favor of plaintiff candidates. The suit alleged that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &sect; 34, violated Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. IX, which related to the position of the candidates on primary and final election ballots.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The candidates brought suit against the secretary seeking injunctive relief on the ground that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &sect; 34 violated Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. IX. The candidates challenged the placement of their names on an election ballot. A single justice of the court entered judgment in favor of the candidates. On appeal, the court vacated the order. The court held that the failure to rotate the names on the ballot did not lessen the opportunity of any voter to cast a vote for the candidate of his choice, nor did it create an opportunity to vote illegally. The court further held that even though it assumed that the first ballot position of the incumbents deprived the candidates of an equal chance to benefit from the indifference of careless voters who had no personal choice but marked the first name, that speculative benefit did not override the rights of informed and intelligent voters to have their votes counted as they were cast. The court held that the record contained no basis for evaluating the comparative advantages and disadvantages of alternative systems of listing candidates on the ballot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city was the only city in the Commonwealth where officers were elected by proportional representation or preferential voting. 1972 Mass. Acts 596, &sect; 3 provided that respondent would place on the ballot a question asking voters whether the city's elective officers should be elected by ordinary plurality voting. Petitioners contended that 1972 Mass. Acts 596 was enacted in violation of the Home Rule Amendment, Mass. Const. amend. art. 89, and that respondent was under no duty to place the question on the ballot. The court reasoned that 1972 Mass. Acts 596 could be classified as a law in relation to cities and towns; therefore, it was subject to the restrictions of Mass. Const. amend. art. 89, &sect; 8. The court found that 1972 Mass. Acts 596 was a special law; although it was phrased in general terms, its primary purpose was to legislate with respect to the local government or local matters of a particular city or town. 1972 Mass. Acts 596 was unconstitutional because it was a special law that was not enacted on a petition filed or approved by the city's voters or the city council or by a two-thirds vote of each branch of the legislature following a recommendation of the governor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The word &quot;Communist&quot; appeared in the candidate's papers, on a line designated for &quot;party or political principle.&quot; The Board refused to accept the candidate's papers under Mass.

Laws ch. 264, &sect; 16A; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &sect; 8 (as amended by 1971 Mass. Acts ch. 202), prohibited the candidate from using the Communist Party as his political designation. The candidate unsuccessfully sought an order requiring the Board to accept his papers, verify the signatures, and certify them to the Secretary. In reversing the trial court's dismissal order, the court held that the word &quot;Communist&quot; was a statement of political principle rather than an assertion of political party. The candidate's papers had not violated the statute by using that word. Although the &quot;Communist Party&quot; was declared a subversive organization, no similar adjudication had been made with regard to persons favoring communist principles.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the trial court's decree.

It ordered the trial court to retain jurisdiction of the case.</SPAN></P>

Defense counsel wanted to interview the witness. The court affirmed, finding defendants failed to show prejudice resulting from the prosecutor's alleged presence at the interview. The court found that after the witness pled guilty before his trial started, there was no further severance question and there was no abuse of discretion in denying the severance motions. The fact that according to his description of the events, a victim lost his trousers and some money would not disqualify him as a witness. The reference by the victim to &quot;other robberies&quot; was not responsive, and the judge promptly struck it from the record and instructed the jury accordingly. Thus, there was no abuse of discretion in denying a mistrial. The court found that the statute did not require that a mask be such that it so totally covered or concealed the facial features that the wearer could not be identified or recognized, thus defendants were properly convicted of armed robbery while masked although the victim could identify them through the stockings on their heads.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because the board was created by the legislature, it had only the powers, duties and obligations expressly conferred upon it by statute or such as are reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose for which it was established. The court concluded that if the board had doubts or was concerned about the constitutionality of the school committee's plan, its appropriate remedy was to seek declaratory relief under Mass. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court considered the questions of whether the proposed bill would violate the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution and Article XVI of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of Massachusetts and whether the attempt to regulate political advertising would constitute interference with or prior restraint on the freedom of the press. The court found that the apparent objective of the proposed legislation was to prevent certain alleged abuses and acts of discrimination on the part of publishers in the area of political advertising. The court found that the bill contained certain obscurities, was impermissibly vague, and was unconstitutional.

The Land Court (Massachusetts) ruled that the amendment was a valid exercise of the authority and powers conferred upon the town by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &sect; 2.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The town amended its zoning by-laws and zoning map by establishing a flood plain district. The amendment affected the landowner's property by restricting or prohibiting the construction of buildings within the district. The landowner contended that the town was not empowered to enact the amendment because it was confiscatory, not regulatory. The court overruled the landowner's exceptions and affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The court held that (1) &sect; 2 did not in any way limit the authority of the town to enact the flood plain zoning by-law, and (2) the amendment was not unconstitutional because there was a reasonable basis for its enactment. The court found that the judgment of the town that the land, which was included in the flood plain district, was subject to seasonal or periodic flooding. The town's determination was not unreasonable, nor was it arbitrary or capricious. The court also found that the amendment had a substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.</SPAN></P>

The court held in favor of the corporation and found it to be in substantial compliance with the procedural requirements of Mass.  Gen. Law ch. 131, &sect; 40 as amended, the &quot;Hatch Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The residents argued that Mass.  Gen. Law ch. 131, &sect; 40 as amended, the &quot;Hatch Act,&quot; was unconstitutional. The residents claimed that the Act afforded them no opportunity to be heard prior to the issuance by the department of natural resources of an order for conditions under which the pond could be filled. The court did not reach the constitutional issue because the Act protected only the public interest and conferred no enforceable rights on the residents. The court affirmed the order. The Act did not preclude proceedings under 1971 Mass. Acts ch. 732, a recent statute aimed at the restraining of damage to the environment. The residents further argued that the construction of the proposed shopping center and the further filling of the pond would result in a nuisance, as to noise and traffic and increased flood danger. The trial judge found that no such results would ensue, and the court concluded that he was not plainly wrong in that finding. Nor was the trial judge plainly wrong in his findings and rulings, contrary to the assertions of the plaintiffs, that the corporation was in substantial compliance with the procedural requirements of ch. 131, &sect; 40.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The commissioner, pursuant to 1971 Mass. Acts 977, issued a decision establishing a reduction in private passenger premium charges and ordering plaintiffs to set aside a special reserve of 35 percent of the premiums earned on compulsory insurance in the previous year to assure the availability of funds to provide for a fair and reasonable sharing of such profits by the policyholders. Plaintiffs contended that the Act was unconstitutional in that any order to refund excessive portions of the previous year's premiums was an unconstitutional taking of property. The trial court reserved the suits without a decision. On appeal the court found the commissioner's decision to be valid and proper. The court held that there was no unconstitutional taking of property or impairment of contract by the adjustment for excessive premiums because the rates set for the previous year's compulsory insurance were provisional and subject to change. Because the rates were subject to change, they did not become the property of plaintiffs. A general reduction in the current year's rates was neither inequitable nor discriminatory to policyholders.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers sought to compel certification that a bond order measure, approved by the city council, was disapproved by the voters because it failed to carry by affirmative vote of at least one-third of the total registered voters. A demurrer was sustained. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The second case was a bill in equity by the same taxpayers against the same defendants, and also against the mayor, the city treasurer, the city auditor, and the redevelopment authority. The bill sought injunctive relief against the issue and sale of bonds and also asked declaratory relief in general terms. The authority's demurrer and the separate demurrer of all the other defendants were sustained. Leave to amend was denied. The taxpayers appealed from the interlocutory decrees sustaining the demurrers and from a final decree dismissing the bill. The court found that Peabody, Massachusetts Charter &sect; 52 did apply to proposed measures presented by initiative, but had no application to referenda under Peabody, Massachusetts Charter &sect; 48. As to a &quot;measure&quot; which had been passed finally by the city council, operation was only suspended pending approval of a majority of the registered voters participating in the referendum.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The three defendants drove to a gas station where they conversed with an attendant who sold them merchandise and passed out cigarettes to them.

One of the defendants conversed with the victim, and then all three men followed him to the university where they attacked him, stabbed him, and stole his wallet. Both the victim and gas station attendant identified defendants in pre-trial line ups, and in photographic identification procedures, which defendants argued were illegal. The trial judge reasoned that assuming the illegality of those procedures, the in court identifications were independent of the in-custody procedures and were therefore valid. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the witness had sufficient prior opportunity to view defendants at the gas station, because he talked to the men in a well lit area and offered each a cigarette. The court also found that the victim had sufficient opportunity to view the defendant that he identified, because he had spoken with him at the gas station and that defendant had been the victim's principal assailant.</SPAN></P>

The court issued an opinion that for the purposes of identifying the cities and towns to which the precepts were to be issued under &sect; 140, the applicable boundaries were those of the fifth congressional district in effect on November 3, 1970. The court interpreted the intent of &sect; 1, as amended by 1971 Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant stated on appeal that the provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123, &sect;&sect; 125 to 143 entitled him to have his criminal proceedings against him stayed and to be committed to a medical facility for treatment. The court found that the determination of whether to stay the criminal proceedings and commit defendant to a treatment facility or to proceed with the trial was for the judge's discretion. The mandatory section of the statute was applicable only to first offenders and was not operative to defendant. No abuse of discretion was shown. On the contrary, the transcript indicated that the trial court was thoroughly familiar with the statute in question and applied it correctly to the facts before him. Defendant also argued that directed verdicts of not guilty on both indictments should have been entered. Defendant incorrectly argued that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94, &sect; 213A was intended to apply only to situations wherein the person charged was present at a place where large quantities of illegal drugs are kept or deposited. The court found no support for the position in the legislative history. Overall, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Superior Court (Massachusetts) reported without decision the declaratory action filed by plaintiff civil service applicant against defendants, Director of Civil Service, Commissioner of the Department of Mental Health, and disabled veteran, to determine whether Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &sect; 23 compelled the Commissioner to appoint the disabled veteran to a civil service post in preference to plaintiff, who was a veteran but not disabled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff scored higher than the disabled veteran on the civil service exam and the Commissioner considered plaintiff the best qualified for the post of assistant commissioner for children's services. The commissioner would have appointed him to the job but for the statutory mandate found at Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 31, &sect; 23, requiring that a disabled veteran be appointed and employed in preference to all other persons, including veterans. Plaintiff argued that this absolute preference for disabled veterans was unconstitutional. The superior court reported the case without decision. The court held that under the facts presented, the absolute preference was contrary to the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. The court held that inasmuch as there was no absolute preference for qualified veterans over qualified non-veterans, there was no rational ground for granting an absolute preference to a qualified disabled veteran over a qualified veteran. The court directed entry of a decree ordering the Commissioner to appoint an assistant commissioner for children's services from the list of eligible candidates without regard to the mandatory preference for disabled veterans.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs compete with other merchants in the sale of tires, batteries, oil, and other automotive accessories. Plaintiffs utilized promotional games and contests at service stations and encouraged their use among their retailers. Although the admitted purpose of utilizing the games was to increase sales, no purchase was necessary to participate in the contests. The court found that the incidental increase in business upon the use of promotional games used by plaintiffs was not the type of consideration necessary to make the games lotteries. The court also found that the statute was not preempted by federal law as no such intention was expressed by Congress. The court declared that the operation of the promotional games by plaintiffs was not prohibited by the state's lottery statutes and did not violate any provision of the U.S. or state constitutions. The court found that the statute was a valid exercise of the police power and was not overbroad but that it was not directed to the type of games of chance conducted by plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

Respondent beneficiaries under the 1923 will contended that the adopted daughter could not take from their vested interests. The probate court, Essex County (Massachusetts), without decision, reported the case on the pleadings for determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The testatrix died in 1928 and her 1923 will was admitted to probate. It provided that her estate was to be divided between her three children and their issue. The daughter had one son and an adopted daughter, and sought declaratory relief on the question of whether her adopted daughter was a beneficiary under the testatrix's will. The court held that Mass.  Gen. Law ch. 27, &sect; 2 (1969) prevented rights from being conferred to the adopted daughter because, with respect to biological children and grandchildren of the testatrix living prior to the effective date of the statute, the interests of each of them in the trust income or corpus became vested in right at the testatrix's death or at their own births. The 1969 statute provided that the terms &quot;child, grandchild, issue, and heir&quot; included one who was adopted, but also provided that its provisions did not to apply to interests that had vested prior to the effective date of the act. The court noted that &sect; 2 was intended to remove doubts as to the constitutionality of the 1969 statutory amendment, which without &sect; 2, raised questions about the constitutionality of the taking of vested substantial interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs were holders of over 10 per cent of the outstanding bonds of the authority. When the authority realized a surplus after setting aside certain funds as required by 1960 Mass. Acts 701, &sect; 9, the funds were deposited with the fiscal agent. Plaintiffs then filed their bill seeking a determination as to the disposition of the funds. The trial court ordered the funds deposited into the sinking fund, and the towns appealed contending that they were entitled to the funds as reimbursement for their contribution to the deficits incurred by the authority. The court affirmed. The court held that 1960 Mass. Acts 701, &sect; 9, as amended, required the deposit of the surplus realized by the authority in the sinking fund for purchase or redemption of bonds. A phrase contained in 1948 Mass. Acts 544, creating a steamship authority, but omitted in 1960 Mass. Acts 701, creating the authority that was a party to plaintiffs action, was not considered revived in construing the 1960 Act.

Upon review, the court affirmed, holding that the benefits of the enforcement provisions of Mass. Gen.

Laws ch. 93, &sect; 14A for a fixed resale price. The court held that the manufacturer's contract did not comply because it authorized each retailer to vary, by as much as three percent, the price of any article covered by the fair price lists. The court held that because the manufacturer's fair trade contracts with persons other than the retailer did not fix a specific invariable price for the commodities, it was not entitled to enforce such contracts and prices against the retailer who was not a party thereto.</SPAN></P>

The court also reasoned that the taxpayer's lengthy separation, which was not pursuant to a court decree, from her husband was inadequate for terminating her marital status. The court further held that the taxpayer did not meet her burden of showing that denying her the refund that she sought while granting it to married couples that were able and willing to file a joint return and to married individuals who were legally separated under a decree of divorce or of separation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff telephone company (company) filed a petition in the Supreme Judicial Court for the County of Suffolk (Massachusetts), appealing an order of defendant Department of Public Utilities (department), which disallowed certain rate revisions filed by the company and authorized the company to file new revisions. The company filed the appeal under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 25, &sect; 5 and claimed that the department's order constituted a confiscation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the department disallowed the company's proposed rate revisions, the company appealed and contended that the department's order deprived the company of its property without reasonable compensation and without due process of law. On appeal, the court remanded and held that (1) the department was permitted to exclude the cost of plant under construction from the company's rate base; (2) there was no constitutional requirement that the department use a year-end, rather than an average test year, rate base in the exercise of its rate-making power; (3) the department did not abuse its discretion in the treatment of the company's investment tax credit; and (4) the department's decision as to the fair rate of return with respect to equity capital did not constitute a confiscation. However, the court remanded the case to the department for reconsideration with respect to the company's capital structure, specifically the company's debt and equity ratios; the rate of return on its capital; and the determination of certain of its test year expenses, including certain advertising costs and charitable expenses, which were beyond the power and authority of the department to disallow.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court remanded the company's petition, which challenged the department's order that disallowed certain rate revisions filed by the company, to the county court. The court directed the county court to enter an order directing further consideration and decision by the department in the light of the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The police failure to serve the complaint warrant on defendant might have been caused by inefficiency or negligence in the district to which the warrant was sent. There was no indication in the evidence that the failure was intentional. The court was unwilling to hold that mere delay in serving a complaint warrant, prior to indictment, constituted failure to afford a speedy trial, at least in the absence of much more than appeared in the case, such as substantial prejudice to defendant's ability to defend himself, or a substantial showing of deliberately improper police conduct harming defendant. The court found that defendant was in no worse position that if his indictment, without prior complaint, had occurred toward the end of the applicable statute of limitations. Whether defendant was prejudiced was a question of fact and law for the trial judge's decision. The court found the trial judge's decisions to be reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Rule 281 related to the payment of jockeys in absence of a special agreement between the jockey and owner. On appeal, the court determined that the commission complied fully with the procedural requirements of N.C.  Gen.

The court found that the presumption of validity permitted a conclusion that it was conceivable that grounds existed which warranted the singling out of jockeys' fees for regulation by rule. The court held that the rule involved no abridgement or interference with the freedom of either the owner or jockey to contract and did not diminish or take away the bargaining posture of either the owner or the jockey. The court concluded that the rule violated no constitutional rights of the owners or trainers. The court held that it could not question the wisdom of the rules adopted by the commission so long as they were within the limits of the power delegated to the commission. Accordingly, the court reversed the portion of the decree finding the rule unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The claimant and defendant driver were involved in an automobile accident that was caused exclusively by the driver's negligence. The claimant brought an action against the driver for reasonable compensation for medical expenses, pain and suffering, and lost wages. The driver refused payment and, as a defense, raised the no-fault automobile insurance law, which had become effective two days prior to the accident. The no-fault automobile insurance law exempted the driver from liability up to $ 2,000 to the extent the claimant was entitled to personal injury protection from his own insurer. As a result, the claimant brought the bill for declaratory relief, claiming the operation of the no-fault automobile insurance law unconstitutionally deprived him of his right to full recovery in tort. The court held the no-fault automobile insurance law was constitutional because it bore a reasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective and it provided an adequate and reasonable substitute for preexisting rights.</SPAN></P>

The court held that S. 1161 would have intruded upon an area preempted by congress. The court ruled that even though the legislative history of 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1431 contained some indication that congress did not intend completely to exclude all state action in the field of aircraft noise control, S. 1161 was so broad as to exceed any permissible state action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant shot a police officer at point blank range during a robbery attempt.

The court also rejected defendant's contention that incriminating statements he had made were not voluntary because of his intoxication, fear, and confusion. The court held that ample evidence supported the trial court's finding of voluntariness. Finally, the court held that the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury that intoxication could negative the existence of specific intent, and properly instructed the jury that it could not find the absence of specific intent solely because it found drunkenness.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 250, &sect;&sect; 9-13 after he was found guilty in the Supreme Judicial Court for the County of Suffolk (Massachusetts) of each of three complaints of assault and battery. Petitioner was sentenced to two years' imprisonment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner argued that the imposition of a greater sentence in the superior court after an appeal from the district court violated his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment in the absence of certain other evidence. The court disagreed. The Commonwealth's interest was not in dealing more harshly with a defendant if he appealed but rather that the superior court use its own independent judgment, based upon the facts as they appeared in the trial before him, in imposing punishment. If a defendant decided to take advantage of a second and fresh opportunity, it was not unfair that, absent affirmative proof of vindictiveness, the State and the defendant should start again at parity. In petitioner's case, there was no allegation of vindictiveness on the part of the judge, much less proof of such conduct. Although not required, the record clearly indicated that the judge was not motivated by vindictiveness in increasing the sentence. The State had a legitimate interest in the procedure, which was to maintain the orderly and effective administration of criminal justice, and in discouraging frivolous appeals. Petitioner's constitutional right to a jury trial was not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff podiatrists appealed the final decree of the Superior Court, Suffolk County (Massachusetts), which found in favor of defendant state plan in the podiatrists' action for a declaration that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176B authorized podiatrists to participate as a matter of right in the state plan. The podiatrists argued that they represented a class and that ch. 176B was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state passed a nonprofit medical service plan. Under ch. 176B, physicians were allowed to participate but podiatrists were not. The podiatrists filed a declaratory action against the state plan, claiming that they represented a class and that ch. 176B denied the class their right to equal protection. The trial court entered a decree in favor of the state plan and held that the podiatrists did not represent a class. The podiatrists appealed. The court modified the decree and affirmed it, holding that the podiatrists' action met the criteria for a class but that the exclusion of podiatrists from ch. 176B was reasonable. The legislature had a rational basis for making the classification, and the exclusion of podiatrists was not done arbitrarily. Chapter 176B did not prevent the podiatrists from practicing their profession in a manner violative of the essential elements of due process. The argument that ch. 176B was an unconstitutional and unlawful delegation of legislative power to the state medical society, as an interested private group, was without merit because no evidence supported the claim that the state plan was subservient to the state medical society.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court modified the trial court's decree to declare that the podiatrists properly represented a class. As modified, the court affirmed the trial court's decree that the state plan did not violate the podiatrists' right to equal protection and that the state law authorizing the state plan was not arbitrary or unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The victim made an in-court identification of defendant and described the details of the rape. Defendant challenged the admissibility of hospital records under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, &sect; 79, contending that the records did not refer to the &quot;treatment and medical history&quot; of the victim. Defendant argued that the hospital records were instead a laboratory test that was prepared for purposes of prosecution. Defendant argued that he was denied his constitutional right of confrontation because a gynecologist who examined the victim at the hospital lacked personal knowledge of how the laboratory tests were made. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction because there was no abuse of discretion in the admission of the hospital records. Such records were not &quot;binding&quot; but were merely evidence that could be contradicted, qualified, believed, or disbelieved. The court held that the laboratory test result showing &quot;sperm&quot; was cumulative evidence in view of the fact that the victim gave birth to a child.</SPAN></P>

The superior court ordered the minor committed to the custody of the youth service board, suspended execution of the order for three years, and placed her on probation on condition that she be placed in the home of a named individual. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the statutes under which the minor was being prosecuted were constitutional. The court found that the argument that a law for the punishment of children who stubbornly disobey their parents was unconstitutional because it was an impermissible intrusion into the privacy of family life was without merit. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the finding of the trial court that the minor was delinquent by reason of her stubborn refusal to submit to the lawful and reasonable commands of a person whose commands she was bound to obey.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The act provided that the department of commerce and development could enter into contracts with industrial and commercial businesses to provide state financial assistance in the form of loans for the construction of water pollution waste treatment facilities to be used by those businesses. To meet the necessary expenditures, the state treasurer, upon the request of the governor, was to issue and sell bonds of the Commonwealth. The governor asked the court whether the bonds violated Mass. Const. art. LXII, &sect; 1, and whether use the proceeds of the bonds involved the expenditure of public funds for other than a public purpose. The court found that the use of public funds under the act did not involve an expenditure for other than a public purpose as water pollution was a danger to the public and a program for its abatement without impairment of local industrial development involved an important public purpose. The court held that the bond issuance was unconstitutional as it did not involve the direct state purchase of a service.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff property owners sought review of the decision of defendant Board of Appeal of Boston (board) that granted defendant developer a zoning variance. The developer filed a motion to require the property owners to file a bond under 1956 Mass. Acts ch. 665, &sect; 11. The Superior Court (Massachusetts) set the bond at $ 50,000 and subsequently dismissed the appeal when the property owners failed to file the bond. The property owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The property owners argued that the bond requirement imposed an unreasonable, unconstitutional limitation upon open and equal access to the courts. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 11 was interpreted like Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c), which granted the trial court discretion in setting the bond. The heavy financial risk of the appeal was a substantial, if not prohibitive, deterrent to questioning the board's decision. There was an important public and private interest in permitting judicial review of the board's decisions to ensure that it conformed with the statutory restrictions upon granting variances. The trial judge's discretion in setting the bond was to be exercised to discourage frivolous and vexatious appeals but not unreasonably to prohibit meritorious appeals. Because the board's record contained no adequate findings of fact to justify the granting of a variance, the trial judge should have considered whether a meritorious review was precluded by the high bond.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the amount of the bond and the dismissal of the property owners' appeal. The court remanded the case to the superior court to reconsider the bond.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The inmate contended that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123, &sect; 113, required a finding of guilty of the crime charged as a basis for the commitment of a defective delinquent. The court disagreed. Nothing in the statute required that defendant had to be convicted of the crime charged before he could be committed as a defective delinquent. Moreover, it had been held that &sect; 113 applied to persons accused of certain specified crimes who after a full hearing were found to be defective delinquents under a statutory definition that did not involve a finding of guilt of any crime. The inmate further contended that if &sect; 113 did not require a finding of guilt as a prerequisite to commitment, it was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. Under &sect; 113, after the district attorney filed an application for commitment of a defendant, the trial court was empowered to commit him for not more than 35 days observation in a defective delinquent department, where he would be examined by two medical experts. If the report concluded that defendant was mentally defective, a hearing was held to determine whether he should be committed to a defective delinquent department.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commissioner's bill sought to enjoin the school committee from putting into effect a resolution allowing a period of not more than five minutes to those teachers and students who wished to participate voluntarily in the free exercise of religion as guaranteed by the United States Constitution. The trial judge ruled that reading by students of the Bible, religious texts, or prayer did not offend against certain recent constitutional decisions of the United States Supreme Court but that participation by teachers did do so. The court dealt with the matter solely on the basis of decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States considering the application of the Constitution of the United States to generally similar situations. The court found that the exercises were held on school property with school committee permission granted by a resolution. It reasonably was inferred that the resolution was a sincere effort to permit continuance, on a wholly voluntary basis, of what had formerly been required by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71, &sect; 31. That statute was held unconstitutional and the practice in the resolution was unconstitutional as well.</SPAN></P>

The court declared that the religious exemption was unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the record showed that having her child vaccinated was contrary to the mother's sincere religious beliefs. The court also held that due to the exemption's clear language, it lacked the authority to expand the religious exemption to those, such as the mother, who did not belong to a recognized religious denomination. The court also held that giving preferred treatment to members of recognized religious denominations violated U.S. Const. amends.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Four sets of landlord groups and tenant groups commenced suit against defendant local rent control boards and sought to enjoin the Massachusetts Rent Control Statute (rent control statute). The suits were reserved and reported without decision by the trial court. The court found that one of the landlords did not have standing to bring suit, and declined to issue the injunction as to the remaining landlords. The court held that: (1) the court did not have jurisdiction over the class of tenants challenging the implementation of rent control regulations because the case was not suitable for treatment as a class action under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 842, &sect; 10; (2) the rent control statute was not unconstitutional; (3) the optional luxury housing exemption, contained in Mass. Gen.

The taxpayers then purchased from the manufacturer a factory built prefabricated home that the taxpayers occupied as a permanent dwelling at the mobile home park. The completely fabricated structure was shipped over the road. The issue was whether the dwelling on the land was a &quot;mobile home&quot; within the meaning of Mass. Gen.

The court affirmed the lower court's decisions on the demurrers and reasoned that defendant commonwealth was not an indispensable party to the suit against defendant DOL because the issue presented in either case could have been resolved in the suit against defendant DOL. The statute was not too vague and plaintiffs were not denied equal protection of the laws because the laws were based on permissible classification.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The insurance companies brought the bill concerning the rates that might have been charged for compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance for the calendar year 1970. The case had been referred to a master, whose report was confirmed by the single justice. The companies had requested a hearing on the rates. The Commissioner had informed the companies that 1968 Mass. Acts 643, &sect; 2A, compelled him to reestablish the same rates that were in force for such insurance for 1967. The master had found that the companies had sustained a substantial aggregate underwriting loss in writing compulsory insurance for 1968. If the rates remained the same, the companies would have sustained an estimated aggregate underwriting loss of almost twice the loss in 1967. The court held that &sect; 2A was unconstitutional because it prescribed the level of the premium rates for the years 1969 and 1970 and on the basis of the facts found those rates were confiscatory. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &sect; 113B (as amended through 1968 Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After a rezoning petition was filed with the city council, petitioner property owners filed a written protest that was signed by more than 20 percent of the area affected.

The land court found that the order for rezoning was null and void because the city council's actions had violated &sect; 7, and intervenor property owners appealed. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 7 was not an improper delegation of legislative power to private individuals because it merely required a percentage vote greater than the usual majority where a proper protest has been filed. Equal protection laws were not violated by &sect; 7 because notice and an opportunity to be heard was given to challengers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff insurance companies filed suit against defendant Commissioner of Insurance for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts seeking a declaration that a portion of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 670, &sect; 6, requiring a downward change in insurance premium rates was unconstitutional because it was confiscatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs filed a bill for declaratory and other relief concerning the rates charged for automobile property damage liability insurance. Mass. Gen. Laws &sect; 670, &sect; 6, required insurance companies to charge 15 percent less than the previous year, and plaintiffs contended that it was confiscatory. Plaintiffs also challenged defendant's duty with respect to rates. Defendant filed a demurrer. The court overruled the demurrer and entered a decree declaring that the rates fixed by &sect; 6 were confiscatory and were, therefore, unconstitutional. Plaintiffs properly did not challenge the power of the Massachusetts Legislature to fix the rates for automobile property damage liability insurance, but rather attacked the constitutionality of those rates. The Legislature's express declaration of its determination that the rates were adequate, just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory did not exempt them from judicial review as to whether they were confiscatory. Under the severability clause of the chapter, the holding did not impair any of the remaining provisions of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Senate of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts sought an answer to questions set forth an order that it had previously adopted, which concerned the pendency of two bills, namely S. 1229, &sect; 1, 1970 Leg. (Mass. 1970) and H.R. 6088, &sect; 1, 1970 Leg. (Mass. 1970), that pertained to town meetings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">During a 1970 session, two bills pertaining to town meetings came before the Senate. Due to concerns regarding the constitutionality of the bills, the Senate sought an advisory opinion from the court. Subsequently, the legislature adjourned until its next session following elections. The court declined to give an answer, holding that the solemn occasion that gave rise to the order ceased to exist when the session ended. Although the court was authorized to give an advisory opinion, its jurisdiction was limited by Mass. Const. pt. II, ch. 3, art. 2 (as supplanted by Mass. Const. amend. art. 85), which the court strictly construed. Because the issue did not concern any sort of public emergency exception, the court felt constrained to give an opinion to a succeeding legislative body in reply to a request propounded by a preceding legislative body.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The teachers were employed by the school committee and were not tenured. The teachers, without the consent of their supervisors, accompanied demonstrators outside of the school and conducted classes at another location. The school committee suspended and then consequently dismissed the teachers for unauthorized absence. The trial court ruled that the teachers, as probationary teachers not serving at the discretion of the school committee, had no statutory or constitutional right to a hearing. The teachers contended that they were entitled to a hearing on their suspension and dismissal under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71, &sect; 41. The court held that in the absence of a statute to the contrary a probationary teacher could be discharged without a hearing and that &sect; 41 did not provided express abridgment of the power of the school committee to dismiss or suspend during the school year a teacher who has been elected, but was not serving at discretion.

Respondent guardian ad litem filed a report in response thereto. The case was submitted to the court on a reservation and report of three questions of law regarding 1969 Mass. Acts ch. 422.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The conservator was the ward's heir presumptive. The ward was 87 years of age and a widow. The conservator was the ward's only child, and the ward had no debts except the usual current living expenses and the cost of her home's maintenance. Her annual income was in excess of $ 50,000, was in a 55 percent tax bracket, and had a total estate of a present market value of approximately $ 1,200.000. The conservator filed a petition in the probate court to make gifts of the ward's property for the purpose of minimizing taxes in the ward's estate in accordance with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 201, &sect; 38, as amended by 1969 Mass. Acts ch. 422. The court found that ch. 420 was not an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. It was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers to probate courts by reason of undefined, vague, or uncertain standards. Chapter 420 permitted the guardian or conservator to be a recipient of the distributions of the ward's estate. The court found that there was no reason why a ward should have been deprived of the privilege of making an intelligent decision in the area of estate planning.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect;&sect; 20, 21, 21A were constitutional, noting that the legislature was free to conclude that harm could attend the employment of contraceptive devices and that if so, the prohibition against their distribution bore a substantial relation to legislative purpose.
