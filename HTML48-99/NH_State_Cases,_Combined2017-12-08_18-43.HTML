In 1983, the State petitioned for defendant's recommittal under the statute and testimony at the hearing revealed considerable disagreement among medical experts regarding defendant's condition. The trial court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the same basis of concluding that mental illness was present in 1973 was still present and order defendant recommitted. Reversing, the court held that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 651:11-a, II (Supp. 1983) was invalid because it denied defendant a chance to defeat the inference of potential dangerousness from evidence of his past dangerous act. The court found that &sect; 651:11-a, II subverted defendant's right to confront the State on the issue of dangerousness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant dog owners challenged the judgment from the Superior Court of Merrimack County (New Hampshire), which, upon a jury verdict, awarded damages to plaintiffs, minor and his father, for injuries sustained by the minor when he was bit by the owners' dog. The owners contended that the superior court erred in applying N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 466:20, which authorized the doubling of damages sustained by a victim of a dog bite.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The minor and his father claimed damages resulting from an alleged violation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 466:19 and from common-law negligence on the part of the dog owners. The dog bit the minor when the minor entered the dog owners' home, where his mother was having coffee. The court affirmed the superior court's judgment. The court held that: 1) owners' argument that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 507:7-a, the comparative negligence statute, barred the minor and his father from recovery, might have had some merit with respect to the strict liability statutory count under &sect; 466.10, but it was clearly inapplicable to the negligence count; 2) for the negligence action, &sect; 507:7-a abrogated the bar to recovery created by the doctrine of contributory negligence; 3) the double damages provision of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 466.20 applied to both the statutory and common-law negligence action; and 4) &sect; 466:20 represented a reasonable response to the problem of injuries caused by dogs and, by its deterrent effect, bore a substantial relationship to the object of the legislation and the classifications it created.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">For purposes of the motor vehicle laws, a habitual offender was a person who was convicted of certain combination of motor vehicle offenses within five years. The trial court held a hearing to determine whether a person was a habitual offender. It he is, the trial court ordered him not to drive a motor vehicle until his license to do so was restored by order the trial court. Here, defendant had no counsel in any of his underlying four motor vehicle violations and did not waive any right to such counsel. A stipulation indicated that the trial court found defendant to be a habitual offender. On appeal, the court remanded the case to the trial court. The court found that an earlier uncounseled misdemeanor conviction could be used as a basis to impose an enhanced penalty for a later repetition of the same offense. A habitual offender order was valid if it rested upon an uncounseled conviction of a motor vehicle violation. An indigent defendant was not entitled to appointed counsel at a hearing to determine whether he was a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant brought his dead child to the hospital, he gave two statements that his wife had abused the child and that he had permitted the abuse to continue. Defendant was convicted of endangering the welfare of his child in violation &sect; 639:3, and he appealed. The court affirmed, holding that a bill of particulars was not required because the indictment was constitutionally sufficient by providing sufficient information to enable defendant to prepare a defense. Defendant's incriminating statements were admissible under U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV because they were non-custodial and voluntary based on the totality of the circumstances. During the interviews at both the hospital and the police station, defendant was free to leave and the presence of uniformed police officers did not satisfy the in-custody requirement. Further, the police officers testified to compliance with Miranda, even though no signed waiver from defendant was obtained. Finally, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction, and the trial court properly denied the motion for a mistrial because a curative instruction was given regarding a detective's actions during the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On an interlocutory transfer without a ruling from the trial court, the question before the state supreme court was whether N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 651:11-a, I (Supp. 1983) if applied to defendant on his indictment for second-degree assault would be an illegal retrospective or ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with assault, pled not guilty by reason of insanity, and was committed to a state hospital under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 651:9 (Supp. 1983). Later N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 651:11 was amended to extend the validity of orders of committal from two to five years. The state then petitioned for recommital. Defendant filed a motion in limine in which he argued that any recommital order could not exceed two years because &sect; 651:11-a would be an unconstitutional retrospective law in violation of the N.H. Const. part I, art. 23 and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court agreed and held that &sect; 651:11-a was a retrospective law in violation of the New Hampshire Constitution. The court reasoned that defendant was disadvantaged because the procedure shifted the burden of initiating judicial review of commitment status, for those who were committed prior to the enactment of &sect; 651:11-a and who desired review of their commitment status more frequently than the five-year review provided for now.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ruled that if the statute committing a defendant to a mental hospital were applied to defendant in this case it would be a retrospective law violative of the New Hampshire Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim filed an action in strict liability, alleging that the manufacturer's front-end loader was unreasonably dangerous and that the injuries were the result of a defective design.

The trial court ordered that the victim file a specific objection to the motion, but upon investigation, counsel determined that the limitations period had passed and did not file it. Accordingly, the trial court granted the manufacturer's motion. New counsel for the victim filed a motion for reconsideration, new trial, and to set aside the order, contending that it was misfortune and not neglect that the potential constitutional defect in the statute had not been identified. The trial court conditionally granted the motion. The statute was subsequently deemed unconstitutional and the manufacturer appealed. The court affirmed, holding that it was not an abuse of discretion to find that counsel's reliance on the validity of the legislation was not neglect and, accordingly, that a grant of a new trial was proper under N.H.

The trial court had followed the precise language of the statute to define the elements of the crime charged, and the definition of the crime did not include the term &quot;malice aforethought.&quot; However, the court found that the trial court erred in sentencing defendant to make restitution and vacated the restitution order.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowner sought review of a decision from the Carroll County Superior Court (New Hampshire), which denied his motion for attorney's fees and double costs. The landowner contended that because he was compelled to bear the financial burden of the administrative and judicial process to protect his clearly established property right from an unconstitutional taking by appellee town, he was entitled to attorney's fees and double costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A free-standing sign stood on the landowner's property, which had been used by a tenant. Upon the tenant's departure, the concrete base, iron pole, flat plate and exposed wires remained in place. The town amended a zoning ordinance limiting the number of free-standing signs and providing that they not be illuminated from within. The landowner applied for a permit to replace the message area of the sign, designating the sign as a pre-existing, non-conforming use. The town selectmen denied the application. The zoning board of adjustment upheld the decision. The trial court concluded that the ordinance insofar as it pertained to pre-existing non-conforming uses was invalid. However, the court denied the landowner's request for attorney's fees. On appeal the court held that: (1) the trial court properly determined that the regulation and the resultant denial of the landowner's application constituted an unconstitutional taking of a vested property right; and (2) where the unconstitutional taking of a vested property right was brought about by the town's failure properly to grandfather pre-existing, non-conforming uses, the landowner was entitled to attorney's fees and double costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's decision insofar as it held that the zoning regulation and the resultant denial of the landowner's application for a permit to replace his sign's message constituted an unconstitutional taking. The court reversed the trial court's decision insofar as it denied the landowner attorney's fees and double costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Superior Court (New Hampshire) transferred questions of law relating to the applicability of certain laws to the specific facts of a case. Defendant driver was indicted for manslaughter and defendant car owner was indicted for negligent homicide after a fatal accident occurred. The owner sought to quash the indictments. The driver filed an interlocutory appeal from the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The vehicle owner allowed the intoxicated driver to use his vehicle while he was at work. The driver was involved in a fatal collision. The owner was indicted for negligent homicide and as an accomplice to such, and the driver was charged with manslaughter and reckless driving. The owner filed motions to quash all indictments and the trial court transferred the questions of law raised by the motions. The trial court denied the driver's motion to dismiss the indictments against him and granted him an interlocutory appeal. The court held that the deaths occurred as the result of the driver's conduct. The court held that the imposition of criminal liability on these facts was a legislative policy decision. The court held that no one could be an accomplice to negligent homicide and quashed all indictments against the owner. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the driver's motion to dismiss the indictments. The court held that the laws under which he was indicted were not duplicitous. The court held that the driver had been indicted on the lesser-included offense of reckless driving, death resulting, as well as manslaughter.

The court remanded the case to the trial court for further action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was stopped at a road check conducted by the two agencies for the purpose of determining compliance with motor vehicle licensing and registration laws and fish and game laws. The officer inquired whether defendant had any weapons or deer, and based upon her response, she was arrested. Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence seized from her vehicle. The court remanded the action to the district court and held that the road check was unconstitutional in that the officer inquired into an area beyond the permissible scope of the search. The court held that a road check conducted to inspect motor vehicle licenses and registration was permissible as a means to enforce public safety, and that the inconvenience and privacy invasion were outweighed by the state's legitimate interest. Reviewing each of the agencies' purposes independently, the court determined that the police department could have legally conducted a search. However, the court did not decide on the legality of the search by the fish and game department because the court found that the inquiry about weapons exceeded the scope of a permissible road check, and was a subterfuge for uncovering other evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the motion. On appeal, the homeowner argued that the statute contained a six-year period of repose, which applied to persons in continuous possession of the property after the time of the defect. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's dismissal and held that the homeowner's action was one for breach of contract, and the &quot;discovery rule&quot; did not apply.

</DIV>

On appeal, the court held that because the public concern of redeveloping a blighted area would be served, the contract was not unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two plaintiffs brought counterclaims for wrongful death of their decedents in response to actions filed by the state to recover expenses for plaintiffs' treatment while they were patients. Both claims were dismissed on the ground of sovereign immunity. The second two plaintiffs' actions were deferred pending the resolution of the certified questions: Did N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 171-A:13 (Supp. 1981) constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity as to state statutory and common law claims in an action for damages brought by the administratrix of the estates of plaintiffs? And if so, was the statute intended to constitute a waiver of the state's immunity from suit in federal court on the state law claims and on the related federal civil rights actions? The court reversed and remanded the two decided cases and answered the questions as follows: N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 171-A:13 and 135-B:43 granted plaintiffs a right to adequate and humane treatment and along with that right came a duty for the state to provide that quality of care. Breach of the duty created a cause of action for damages in tort. However, the court found no waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Belknap County Superior Court (New Hampshire) transferred three questions to the court: 1) whether N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 490:4-a was constitutional under the doctrine of separation of powers; 2) whether courts had inherent authority to control the wearing of firearms in the courtroom; and 3) whether a criminal defendant's right to a fair trial was infringed upon by virtue of the presence of law enforcement officers who appeared fully armed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 490:4-a provided that notwithstanding any other rule, regulation, or order to the contrary, law enforcement officers were permitted to wear firearms in any courtroom in the state. The court held that &sect; 490:4-a violated the separation of powers doctrine provided by N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 37. Any legislative act violating the constitution or infringing on its provisions was void because the legislature, when it stepped beyond its bounds, acted without authority. The judiciary, whose duty it was to expound what the law was, simply compared the legislative act with the constitution. Because the constitution could not be adjudged void, the courts had no choice but to declare any act which was inconsistent with it to be of no effect. The power of the judiciary to control its own proceedings, the conduct of participants, the actions of officers of the court, and the environment of the court was a power absolutely necessary for a court to function effectively and do its job of administering justice. Thus, trial judges could, in the exercise of their discretion, determine when and where police could wear guns while appearing in court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court answered that the statute violated the separation of powers doctrine under the state constitution and that trial judges could, in the sound exercise of their discretion, determine when and where police could wear guns while appearing in court, keeping uppermost in mind the requirements of procedural due process and the need to provide security for courtrooms and weapons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a lawsuit between defendant municipality and plaintiff firefighters' unions, the Superior Court of Strafford County (New Hampshire) tendered certified questions, via interlocutory transfer, asking whether the municipality had the power, through its elected officials, power to delegate to a private corporation the duties of fire protection and suppression and, if so, whether such power had been exercised in accordance with state law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Municipality contracted with a private corporation, pursuant to which corporation would provide firefighting services. Firefighters unions sued municipality, seeking a ruling that the contract entered into was invalid and unconstitutional. A preliminary injunction was issued, and two questions were certified for review the first dealing with the constitutionality of the statute authorizing such contracts, the second dealing with whether municipality complied with that statute's requirements. The court declined to reach the constitutional question. On the statutory compliance issue, the court found that municipality had failed to comply with the statute's requirements, and thus its contract was void. Specifically, State law prohibited municipalities from contracting with any private firefighting organization unless the organization was certified by the State fire marshal. Although the corporation in this case obtained post-contract certification, that did not cure the error here. The law required pre-contract certification, and the municipality lacked the power to enter into any contract where the corporation lacked such certification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police went to defendant's auto sales lot with a warrant to search for a vehicle. While on the premises, the officers recorded a vehicle identification number (VIN) from another vehicle, a pickup truck, upon the belief that it was a stolen vehicle. The officers later verified that the pickup was stolen and returned to defendant's lot to retrieve it. However, the pickup was gone. The officers went to an auto repair business to look for pickup, but they did not find it. However, the officers seized a different truck, which bore defendant's dealer plate, for failure to have a VIN. A search of the truck, and a search of a camper on defendant's lot, revealed evidence linking defendant with a stolen car, which was later seized. Defendant was charged with receiving stolen property, i.e., the car. He filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized from the car, the camper, and the pickup. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant was found guilty. The court reversed, holding that the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress because the taking of the VIN from the truck constituted a search, the officers failed to obtain a warrant, and no warrant exceptions were applicable.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the extended term of imprisonment statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. The superior court denied the petition. Plaintiff contended on appeal that he had been penalized for electing to plead not guilty and go to trial. The court affirmed the judgment against plaintiff. The court held that N.H. Rev. Stat.

The court found that, on its face, &sect; 651:6 did not apply only to defendants who asserted their right to plead not guilty and seek a jury trial. The court concluded that selective use of the extended term statute only against those defendants who elected to plead not guilty and go to trial was constitutionally permissible.

On further appeal, the judgment was vacated and remanded for further review. The court reversed, holding that the Act was unconstitutional because the local interests that it sought to protect did not outweigh the excessive burdens imposed on interstate commerce. The court noted that the purpose of the Act was 1) to protect resident security holders and 2) to regulate the internal affairs of corporations. The definition of a target company in the Act was broader than necessary to ensure that the state was regulating only corporations that had both substantial assets and shareholders in the state.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father, a Methodist, and mother divorced after the mother became a zealous convert to a non-traditional religion. The trial court awarded custody to the mother and structured the father's visitation with specific reference to Methodist holidays. The father thereafter obtained joint legal custody of the children and a change in the visitation schedule that deleted the reference to the Methodist religion, but otherwise the schedule remained the same as before. The mother sought a &quot;clarification&quot; of the decree, alleging that the schedule established a preference for the husband's religion in contravention of the Constitution. The trial court denied her request and she sought review. The court affirmed the joint legal custody, but reversed and remanded the part of the judgment awarding the visitation rights. The court found that the visitation schedule showed a preference for the father's religion, and held that in awarding visitation rights a trial court was bound by the Constitution to stay neutral and not prefer one religion over another.

Thereafter, the trial court reserved and transferred all questions of law raised by the defendants' exceptions. The court affirmed the defendants' perjury convictions. The court held that although the evidence of falsity was circumstantial, it was sufficient to support the guilty verdicts beyond a reasonable doubt. Also, the determination of materiality was a question of law and therefore did not fall within the purview of the jury. Further, the prosecutor's comment concerning tax fraud in his closing arguments was not unduly prejudicial. Likewise, the oath given to the defendants in connection with the depositions containing the false statements was sufficient to satisfy N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 641:1. Additionally, financial statements from the civil suit were admissible for identification purposes. Finally, the jury instructions were not erroneous, as they contained clear, concise, and accurate statements of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The senate requested the opinion of the court in regards to House Bill 821, which allowed the administration of compulsory medication, under certain conditions, to mental patients who were committed or temporary involuntary emergency hospitalization pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 135-B:19. Specifically, the senate asked whether a proposed amendment violated the patient's due process right to privacy, bodily integrity, or personal security. The court held that House Bill 821 violated an involuntary hospitalized patient's due process rights. The administration of medical or psychiatric treatment, particularly the use of antipsychotic drugs, could have drastic effects upon one's well-being. Effects included muscular disorders, diminished spontaneity, and blurred vision. Thus, the right of a mentally ill person to refuse medical treatment was a liberty interest protected by the state constitution. The right to refuse medical treatment was not absolute; however, the court did not agree with the proposed finding of probable cause for involuntary emergency hospitalization.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff injured persons brought actions against defendant manufacturers in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, challenging the constitutionality of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 507-D (Supp. 1979). The cases were consolidated and the matter was certified to the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured persons were hurt while using products of the manufacturers. Their cases were consolidated and the question of the constitutionality of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 507-D (Supp. 1979) was reviewed. The 12-year statute of repose under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 507-D:2, II(a) (Supp. 1979) was unconstitutional. It was not reasonable because it nullified causes of action before they arose, nor was it substantially related to an important legislative objective because the products liability insurance crisis had abated on its own. The three-year statute of limitations for products liability actions in N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 507-D:2, I (Supp. 1979) violated equal protection because it was not reasonable nor substantially related to a legitimate legislative objective for it to be less than that for all other personal actions. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 507-D:3 (Supp. 1979) violated equal protection because it denied those injured by modified products the right of apportionment enjoyed by all other products liability plaintiffs. Finally, the &quot;state of the art&quot; defense under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 507-D:4 (Supp. 1979) was rational but was stricken as part of the voided statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured persons were successful in their challenge to the constitutionality of certain products liability statutes in New Hampshire. Both the statute of repose and the statute of limitations violated equal protection. The statute preventing those injured by modified products from recovering also violated equal protection. Although the &quot;state of the art&quot; defense was rational it had to be stricken because the rest of the statute was voided.</SPAN></P>

The question was whether establishment of &quot;alternate business profits&quot; as a class of property, as proposed in HB 316, exceeded a reasonable exercise of the general court's power to classify property for purposes of taxation N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 6. In answering the inquiry, the court considered the adjustment, deductions, and credits provided in 316 and concluded that the deductions appeared to be valid because they were applicable to all businesses that suffered a loss and was reasonable and uniform. Therefore, the court concluded that the establishment of alternate business profits as a taxable class appeared to be constitutional. However, the court held that the taxation of the alternate business profits impermissibly classified taxpayers under art. 6. As to Bill 674, the court held that the establishment of a &quot;tax base&quot; as a class of property appeared to be a reasonable means of enlarging the taxable class of property beyond the narrower base under the present business profits tax.</SPAN></P>

In 1973, the company received a license from the racing commission to hold race meets in the town. Between 1974 and 1979 the citizens of town voted against allowing Sunday dog racing. In 1981, the legislature changed the statutory provision governing local control over Sunday racing by authorizing any licensee who requested a license to hold greyhound race meets on Sundays. The company received permission to commence greyhound races on Sundays at its facility in the town. The company held Sunday race meets through the end of 1981. The town residents argued that the 1981 legislation unlawfully deprived them of a vested right to local control over Sunday greyhound racing. The court affirmed the judgment of the superior court. The court held that: (1) the residents had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the 1981 legislation; (2) the state legislature, which in 1971 gave the towns local option on Sunday greyhound racing, could lawfully take it away in 1981; and (3) neither the town nor its citizens had any constitutional rights to local option control over greyhound racing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After stolen property was discovered at defendant's apartment, defendant made a full confession and was indicted for theft by unauthorized taking, burglary, and conspiracy to receive stolen property. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court rejected defendant's argument that the burglary indictment was defective as it failed to enumerate any facts of the crime of theft because all the state was required to prove was a purpose to commit theft. Second, the statutory definition for the crime of receiving stolen property was not unconstitutional as the use of the word &quot;probably&quot; in N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 637:7, I did not permit the state to convict a defendant without proving the defendant's required mental state beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, the finding that the search warrant affidavit did not contain material misrepresentations was not unreasonable. Finally, the court found that the trial court's policy of refusing to permit any witness, including the state's witness against defendant, to be impeached with a prior criminal conviction constituted reversible error as it violated defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 181:9-a upon an applicant for a liquor wholesaler's permit was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The stockholders desired to sell their interests in the corporation. The prospective purchaser was willing to purchase the corporation, provided he could qualify for a wholesaler's permit to distribute alcoholic beverages. Defendants, members of the New Hampshire State Liquor Commission, took the position that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 181:9-a prohibited them from issuing a wholesaler's permit to the purchaser because he had not been a New Hampshire resident for three years. The corporation and the stockholders alleged that &sect; 181:9-a was unconstitutional. The court dismissed the petition as to the corporation and the stockholders because they lacked standing to litigate the validity of the residency requirement and they could not raise the constitutional claims of another. As to the purchaser, the court held that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 491:22 required the purchaser to have a &quot;present legal or equitable right.&quot; The record showed that the purchaser only consulted the Commission about the possibility of receiving a wholesaler's license and that no formal application had been made to the Commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission ordered that the company not issue any securities to further work on the second phase of the construction of an electrical plant until the company had divested itself of a fixed portion of its plant stock, its financial condition improved, or the first phase of construction was completed. The commission held that the conditions would strengthen the company's financial condition. On appeal, the court held that under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 369:1, the commission lacked the authority to impose conditions on the company's future financing. The commission had misinterpreted the scope of its authority to define the &quot;public good&quot; under &sect; 369:1. The commission had issued certification of the plant site and facility eight years prior, and the curtailment of construction amounted to a taking without just compensation under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 12. The commission violated the company's due process rights by determining, without notice to the company, that the company had imprudently retained too many employees at the plant site. The company was entitled to proper notice before the commission's determination of costs that could affect future utility rates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners initially filed suit in Massachusetts alleging wrongful termination of service by the corporation. Relief was denied for both parties when the court found that no contract existed. The landowners later filed this declaratory judgment action for a determination of their right to water service from the district. The trial court ordered a temporary injunction requiring water service and the corporation intervened and counterclaimed. The trial court then denied the landowners a nonsuit and consolidated a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action. The parties appealed the judgment finding a violation by the district and money owed by the landowners. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. The court held that the corporation's quantum meruit claim was a counterclaim barred by res judicata because it should have been asserted in a Massachusetts case when it arose out of the same transaction as the landowners' suit. The trial judge was correct in refusing to award the landowners damages because there was insufficient evidence in the record to justify an award.

The supplier appealed and contended that the statute violated the equal protection clauses of the United States Constitution and the New Hampshire Constitution.

The court ruled that the statute did not grant materialmen and suppliers of labor the same protection as it gave architects and contractors. The court found that in the construction of a building the end product was the result of collective efforts, and fundamental fairness required that all who participated in the enterprise account for their share of the blame for any negligent acts performed or defective materials supplied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The creditor filed an action against the debtors to collect money owed. The action was concluded when the parties entered into an agreement whereby the debtors would make monthly payments until the money was paid in full.

After one debtor was arrested and deposited bail, the debtors filed a motion to quash the writ of capias and recover the bail. On appeal of the district court's order denying the motion, the court reversed and held that the use of an ex parte capias writ to initiate collection or civil contempt proceedings before the debtors had notice or any opportunity to appear voluntarily for a hearing concerning their reasons for nonpayment and present ability to pay violated the debtors' procedural due process rights under both U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.H. Const. pt. 1, art. 15.The court ordered that use of writs of capias or other forms of arrest warrants to initiate civil contempt proceedings against judgment debtors cease.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the decision of the Rockingham County Superior Court (New Hampshire), which convicted him, pursuant to a jury verdict, of first-degree assault. Defendant argued that the superior court improperly admitted certain testimony that defendant claimed was protected by the physician-patient privilege and that his jury was unconstitutionally selected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant allegedly shot his wife and then himself. Both survived. Defendant made admissions to two emergency medical technicians (EMT's), who transported him to the hospital. While in the emergency room (ER), one EMT heard defendant tell the physician that he had shot his wife and had shot himself. The court affirmed the judgment. Although statements about how the injury occurred were customary and necessary for diagnosis and treatment, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 329:26 (Supp. 1979), applied only to physicians and surgeons and those working under their supervision. Because EMT's were not physicians or surgeons and there was no evidence that the EMT's were working under their supervision, the privilege did not protect defendant's admission in the ambulance. Defendant conceded that the EMT who heard defendant in the ER was not working under the supervision of the physician, but was lingering in the ER out of curiosity. Ordinarily, the presence of an extraneous third party to a privileged conversation destroyed the privilege. Defendant failed to put into the record any facts that would have prevented the application of that rule. Thus, defendant's admissions were properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 169-B:26), his election to be tried as an adult was invalid; and the sentencing procedure in his case was improper due to the lack of a presentence investigation report when he was originally sentenced. The trial court denied the writ, but ordered that a presentence report be prepared and that a new sentencing hearing be held. The order was stayed pending appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the writ of habeas corpus, but held that it erred in its determination that the juvenile had to be resentenced. The court held that the juvenile not only did not object to the sentencing procedure at the time, but he also failed to raise any objections to the sentencing procedures when he had subsequent opportunities to do so.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 556:12. The Superior Court, Grafton County, (New Hampshire) granted the employer's motion to dismiss on the basis that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 281:12 (Supp. 1979) barred the action and limited recovery by the estate to that expressly provided under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 281:22. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 20-year-old decedent was crushed to death while performing maintenance on a machine used to remove bark from logs. On appeal from the dismissal of the wrongful death action, his father attacked the constitutionality of a statute that barred the estates of deceased employees from bringing statutory actions against an employer and limited recovery to funeral expenses. The court noted that in all other wrongful death cases, the legislature provided that the estate of a person who died without dependents was entitled to receive up to $ 50,000. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 281:12 (Supp. 1979) prevented the estates of employees from bringing a wrongful death action and possibly recovering up to $ 50,000. In return, the estate was given the right to receive up to a maximum of $ 1,200 toward burial expenses under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 281:22 IV. Thus, an employer, no matter how negligent or egregious its conduct, except for the possible payment of $ 1,200, could escape all liability for the work-related death of an employee. The court held that this limit was not only contrary to sound public policy but also violated the equal protection provisions of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the action and directed that the father was entitled to proceed with an action for wrongful death against his decedent's employer if he elected to forego the benefits otherwise provided by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty of aggravated felonious sexual assault. On appeal, he contended that the trial court improperly denied him the opportunity to cross-examine the prosecutrix concerning inconsistent statements she made concerning whether she was a virgin at the time of the rape. The court found that because the prejudice to the prosecutrix resulting from the disclosure that she might not have been a virgin at the time of the alleged rape was minimal, defendant must have been afforded the opportunity to cross-examine her concerning her inconsistent statements. The court determined that the trial court's ruling barring any evidence of the prior sexual activity of the prosecutrix with any person other than defendant violated defendant's constitutional right to rebut the case against him by attempting to establish that she had sexual relations with a person other than defendant and that such relations accounted for the presence of sperm in her vagina on the day of the alleged rape.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Cheshire County (New Hampshire), which ruled that an amendment to the city's zoning ordinance had deprived plaintiff property owners of all reasonable use of the portion of their property which was included in the conservation zone created by the amendment, and the amendment constituted inverse condemnation. A determination of damages was ordered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners argued that an amendment to the city's zoning ordinance, which had the effect of including a substantial part of their land in a conservation district and prohibited them from developing that land, resulted in a taking of their property. The supreme court agreed, dismissed the appeal, and remanded the case for a determination of damages. The court held that the creation of the conservation district in the city constituted a taking with respect to all of the property owners' land that fell within that district, entitling the property owners to compensation for inverse condemnation in an amount equal to the diminution in the value of all of the land impacted by the regulation. The court reasoned that a taking resulted when the application of a zoning ordinance to a particular piece of property denied the owner economically viable use of his land. The court declined to follow cases that had held that a landowner was not entitled to inverse condemnation damages in such a situation but was limited to the remedies of mandamus or a declaratory judgment to invalidate the regulation, opining that such an approach was contrary to well established law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court dismissed the appeal and remanded the case for a determination of damages and for assessment of additional reasonable counsel fees and costs at the lower court level incurred after the effective date of the zoning regulation amendment in the property owners' inverse condemnation action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The New Hampshire House of Representatives requested an opinion on the constitutionality of proposed legislation that would amend the Administrative Procedures Act, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 541-A, by creating a mechanism by which the legislature could review, and either accept or reject, rules proposed by state administrative agencies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A question was raised as to the constitutionality of proposed legislation requiring state agencies to submit rules for legislative approval prior to filing a notice of intended action. Under that statute, the proposed rules would be presented to standing committees of both the House of Representatives and the Senate for their approval by a quorum of their members. The court held that with substantial changes, the proposed legislation could be constitutionally enacted. The creation of a legislative veto for rules and regulations promulgated by administrative agencies was not per se unconstitutional. Instead, it actually buttressed the underlying delegation of rulemaking authority by restricting the extent to which the executive branch could engage in unilateral lawmaking. However, the court found that the statute violated the state constitution in that a proposed rule could become effective without executive approval, and executive disapproval would not have affected the rule's adoption. The court determined that there was no reason to treat rules proposed by administrative agencies differently than bills or resolutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The request asked whether a proposed prohibition on sales and advertising of drug paraphernalia violated any provision of the federal or state constitution. The court replied to the request.

The court stated that that portion of the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. However, the court found that the language of the proposed statute on advertising was broad enough to apply to speech entitled to full First Amendment protection and was therefore unconstitutional. The court further found that the proposed statute violated N.H. Const. pt. 1, art. 22.

The superior court followed a master's recommendation and declared that an approval letter issued under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 147:30-d was valid, but plaintiffs had to comply with the town's dump ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner agreed to let the landfill operator open a private disposal site on a farm that had hosted a small public dump. The town issued a &sect; 147:30-d approval letter but later disclaimed the letter and notified plaintiffs to comply with its dump ordinance. On appeal, the court held that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 147:30-a to -d did not preempt local authority to regulate private disposal sites. Rather, it provided for towns to participate in the approval and regulatory process. The court rejected an argument that the dump ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and held that the terms &quot;good cause and sufficient reason&quot; for the issuance of a license provided adequate criteria for the town board of selectmen to exercise discretion, particularly when the ordinance contained a statement of purpose that further defined the terms of the ordinance. The court found that plaintiffs had notice of what facts they had to establish to obtain a license. The court also held that the ordinance was a valid exercise of the town's police power under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31:39 (Supp. 1979) and was not a zoning law that required adoption in compliance with N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31:60 to :89.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff bank sought review of a decision of defendant New Hampshire State Tax Commission, which disallowed certain deductions the bank had taken under the business profits tax law, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 77-A, for dividends paid to it by its subsidiary. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court, Hillsborough County (New Hampshire) transferred, without ruling, questions of law raised by the motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the business profits tax law (BPTL) , N.H. Rev. Stat. ch. 77-A, became effective, the subsidiary paid dividends to the bank for earnings accumulated before the law's effective date. The bank deducted the dividends from its earnings pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-A:4 V (Supp. 1979). The Commission denied the deductions, and the bank sought review of the Commission's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed the Commission's ruling, holding that the bank could not claim the deduction because the subsidiary had itself never paid taxes on the earnings represented by the dividends. The court also ruled that chapter 77-A did not result in double taxation in violation of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 5 or an unreasonable tax under N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 5 because banking taxes paid by the subsidiary under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 84 did not tax the bank's business profits. The court found further that the BPTL did not apply retroactively in violation of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 23 because the bank had not received the dividends until after the BPTL became effective. The court held that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 84:18 did not allow the subsidiary to pass its tax credits on to the bank.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded after answering the questions transferred in such a way as that it upheld the Commission's decision that had denied the deductions claimed by the bank.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee, a college instructor, received a notice of special appointment to teach at an elementary school operated by the college as part of its teacher education program. Although the notice of appointment required the employee to sign and return it, she failed to do so. She performed the duties of a teacher and cashed the checks that she received. At the end of the school year, the employers decided not to rehire the employee and hired another person instead. The employee alleged that the faculty handbook entitled her to earlier notice and that the lack of such timely notice entitled her to employment for the following year. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court that granted summary judgment to the employers. The court held that by not signing the acceptance, the employee was not entitled to the protection of the termination provisions of the contract contained in the faculty handbook. She could not deny the employers their right to enforce the contract against her and at the same time claim its benefits against them. The employee's general and bare allegations of expected proof were insufficient to raise genuine issues of fact to preclude summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The town instituted an action to enjoin the landowner from using a parking lot until he obtained proper permits from its zoning authorities. The trial court granted an injunction based upon Durham, N.H., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 10.32 and denied the landowner's motion for reconsideration and clarification. Another court ruled that the authority of the city's planning board under &sect; 10.32 to require site review approval for internal changes to buildings exceeded the authority that was delegated to the town by N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 36:19-a (Supp. 1979). The trial court subsequently granted the landowner's motion to dissolve the injunction. On appeal, the court reversed the order against the town. The court held that the trial court erred in granting the motion to dissolve the injunction without first determining that Durham, N.H., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 10.32 as a whole was invalid. The court found that &sect; 10.32 was valid, except insofar as it required site review for internal changes. The court held that the trial court was correct in issuing the injunction and was in error in dissolving it because &sect; 10.32 required site review plans for the construction of the parking lot.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding no unconstitutional vagueness in the statute in question and holding that the indictment gave defendant ample information to enable him to prepare for trial and, therefore, was constitutionally sufficient.

The trial court found him to be a dangerous sexual offender and sentenced him to 11 to 20 years imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The court rejected defendant's argument that because the only issue was whether he was the perpetrator and since the victim's consent was not at issue, the evidence of her prior chastity was inadmissible and required a new trial. The court held that defendant waived his right to challenge the trial court's ruling that the victim should submit an affidavit in response to defendant's request to depose the victim because he did not object at the time the ruling was made. The court ruled that the fact that a small number of persons under the age of 30 were included in the jury array did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. Lastly, the court ruled that the possible prejudice to defendant caused by the prosecutor's arguing facts not in evidence and asking the jury to use its imagination was cured by the prosecutor's own retraction of his statements and the trial court's curative instructions.</SPAN></P>

VI was violated, that he was deprived of his right to use the competing harms defense, and that he was deprived of an impartial jury. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Defendant's right to speedy trial was not violated by the state's failure to arraign him in superior court for 13 months. Defendant's failure to request a speedy trial was weighted against him even though he was without counsel because he elected to proceed pro se. Defendant was aware that he did not have the right to enter the property based on the &quot;no trespassing&quot; signs posted on the property. Thus, it was not error to deny him the opportunity to use the competing harms defense. The trial court adequately questioned the jury regarding their qualifications to serve.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">&nbsp;N.H. Rev. Stat.

When the defendant challenged the jury, the trial court took testimony from 10 selectmen regarding the jury selection practices. The method varied widely. One selectman testified that he picked people who wanted to serve and who had the time to do so because they were retired. Another selectman testified that he specifically excluded people who volunteered. Another selectman picked the jurors by placing the checklist on the floor and tossing a coin. Statistical evidence showed that people between the ages of 18 and 34 made up about 38.4 percent of the population of the county and 11.4 percent of them were jurors. Statistically, the court did not find that young blacks were unconstitutionally underrepresented. However, until the legislature enacted a new statute that prescribed a suitable alternative method for selecting the jurors, the court required all future jury lists to be drawn at random from voter checklists under the supervisory direction of the clerks of court.</SPAN></P>

In so holding, the court found that: 1) the classifications created by &sect; 507-C were required to be reasonable and to have a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation; 2) the restrictions on expert testimony placed too burdensome a restriction on the patients; 3) the statute of limitations set forth in &sect; 507-C improperly made the &quot;discovery rule&quot; unavailable to the patients and impermissibly extinguished the &quot;saving clause&quot; for minors and incompetents; 4) the notice provision of &sect; 507-C afforded special treatment to doctors and bore no reasonable relationship to &sect; 507-C's stated purpose; 5) the statute improperly restricted the amount of damages the patient's could recover; and 6) the valid provisions of &sect; 507-C were not severable from the invalid ones.</SPAN></P>

By the terms of its contract with one insurer, notice was given to plaintiff of the insurer's intent to terminate their contract. Plaintiff filed a complaint with the state's Insurance Grievance Committee, which had been created to review the termination by insurance companies of agency agreements. The Committee affirmed the termination, but extended its effective date. Plaintiff appealed to the superior court, which certified questions to the state's Supreme Court. The issue before the Supreme Court was the constitutionality of the Committee. The court held that the statute that created the Committee was an unconstitutional and unlawful delegation of legislative power, an unlawful usurpation of judicial power, and an unlawful interference with pre-existing contracts because state law prohibited the delegation of legislative powers without proper restriction upon that power. It remanded the cause to the superior court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The issue on appeal was whether &sect; 644:2(I) was void for vagueness or overbreadth. The court reversed defendants' convictions. The court concluded that the language of the statute swept unnecessarily broadly into the constitutionally protected area of free speech. The court held that the portion of &sect; 644:2(I) at issue was unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and N.H. Const. pt. 1, arts. 22, 32. The court found that the State had the authority to pass statutes that vested a limited amount of discretion in police officers to insure and protect travel on the streets. The court further found, however, that there was no evidence that the police could not have insured the safe flow of traffic without having to resort to arrests and criminal charges against defendants.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 541:6, petitioner water works sought review of an order of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) (New Hampshire), which granted the water works request to establish temporary rates, but made them effective on a date later than the one requested by the water works.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The water works, a public utility, proposed increased rates and filed new rate schedules. Due to the staggered quarterly billing system it used, the commencement date of the new rates would have resulted in many customers paying the higher rate for water they already used before the water works had even filed for the increase. The PUC prevented the proposed rates from going into effect by suspending their effective date pending investigation under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 378:6. The water works filed a petition pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 378:27, 378:29 for approval of the rates. The PUC granted the temporary rates, but made them effective four months later than the date the water works had requested. On appeal, the court remanded and held that if the rate increase were allowed it would have retroactively altered the law and the contractual agreement between the parties and would have created a new obligation in respect to a past transaction, in violation of N.H. Const. pt. 1, art. 23. The court held that the PUC may have decided the matter differently if it had been aware of the full extent of its authority, so it was proper to remand the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commissioner initiated procedures to acquire the condemnees' land for park purposes by eminent domain pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 219:2. The condemnees did not wish to sell their property and filed a complaint in federal district court and argued that the exercise of eminent domain was unconstitutional. The court held that to deny a hearing to the condemnees prior to the taking merely because their land was sought for park purposes rather than highway purposes violated the equal protection guarantees of the state constitution. The classification of the land as to the purpose for which it was sought was not logically and reasonably related to a valid state interest. To withhold from the condemnees certain procedural safeguards that would have been available if their land had been sought for highway purposes denied them equal protection under the law. The condemnees' ownership, use and enjoyment of their private property were fundamental personal rights under the state constitution. The state had no compelling state interest in denying a hearing. A hearing on the question whether the taking should go forward was required before the filing of a declaration of taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, the Commissioner of Insurance, ruled that the state could regulate an insurance plan insured by plaintiff, under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 415:18-a (1977). Plaintiff filed a motion for rehearing and defendant reaffirmed the original decision, and plaintiff appealed. The commissioner ruled that state regulation of the benefits provided under the plan insured by plaintiff was not preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1001 et seq., which provided insurance coverage for state residents employed in the state and their dependents. Plaintiff maintained that the commissioner's decision misinterpreted ERISA. The court dismissed plaintiff's appeal. The court found that Congress, in its enactment of ERISA, did not manifest a clear and manifest purpose to preempt the historic police powers of the states to regulate the contents of group insurance contracts. The court rejected plaintiff's contention that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 415:18-a (Supp. 1977) violated the commerce clause of the United States Constitution and conflicted with the policies of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 141 et seq.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 262-A:62:1, as amended by 1979 N.H. Laws 362:1. Defendant pleaded not guilty, and pending trial on the merits, the Nashua District Court transferred three questions of law concerning interpretation of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statute provided that if a defendant had a prior conviction within seven years preceding the date of the second offense, such person would have been guilty of a misdemeanor and had to be sentenced to imprisonment for a period of not less than seven days and fined not less than $ 1,000. The questions were whether the legislature intended to make the imposition of sentences mandatory upon the sentencing judge so as to eliminate and terminate any judicial discretion to suspend the jail sentence, whether the legislature could have adopted legislation so as to terminate and eliminate the judicial discretion in offenses such as driving while intoxicated, and whether the sentencing provision of the statute, as amended, was unconstitutional for failure to set forth a maximum jail sentence. The court determined that the statute, as amended, made no reference to a withdrawal of the inherent common-law judicial authority to suspend imposition or execution of sentence. The court concluded that the statute referred only to the minimum sentence and in way affected the maximum sentence established by N.H. Rev. Stat. &sect; 651:2(II)(c).</SPAN></P>

The city argued its liability was limited to $ 50,000 in each case, pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 507(B)(4) (Supp. 1977), which plaintiffs argued was unconstitutional. The court held the statute was not unconstitutional in that it did not violate N.H. Const. art. 14, &sect; I. The court also held that it was not unconstitutional for denying plaintiffs equal protection, nor did &sect; 507(B)(4) create the type of suspect classification that demanded a strict scrutiny analysis. Plaintiffs argued that the $ 50,000 limitation violated due process because it was harsh and unreasonable compared to their alleged damages.

The court denied the writ, finding that the constitutionally guaranteed right of privacy did not extend to private heterosexual intercourse with a person whom the legislature determined was unable to give consent due to minority. The court found that the state's independent interest in the well being of its youth gave the state broader authority to proscribe children's privacy rights. The court ruled that there was no requirement of a culpable mental state in order to be convicted of statutory rape, and a good faith belief that the minor was actually of legal age was no defense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a dangerous sexual offender (DSO), filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the Hillsborough County Court (New Hampshire), which alleged that the procedural aspects of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. Ch. 173-A were unconstitutional. The county court transferred the petition without ruling upon the merits of defendant's claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to five counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault. Pursuant to the Dangerous Sexual Offenders Act (Act), N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 173-A:3 (Supp. 1977), he was adjudicated to be a DSO and committed to the Director of Mental Health for an indefinite term. Two years later, defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which challenged the procedural aspects of the Act. Defendant claimed that the Act's release procedures violated his constitutional right to equal protection because there was no rational basis for distinguishing between a DSO and other individuals involuntarily committed to the New Hampshire Hospital. The court found that the system of imposing a sentence only if a defendant was not declared to be a DSO was unconstitutional because it permitted different procedures for the commitment and release of a DSO from those provided for commitment of persons acquitted by reason of insanity or civil commitments. Accordingly, the court imposed a new requirement that required the trial courts to impose an appropriate sentence for crimes committed by a DSO.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded defendant's petition for habeas corpus so that a sentence could be imposed on his underlying criminal conviction with full credit for all prior periods of confinement. The court authorized other DSOs who were incarcerated to petition their convicting courts for discharge or for imposition of sentence. The State was authorized to petition for imposition of sentence, discharge, or for civil commitment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff father brought a petition under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 460:29 (Supp. 1977) to legitimate a child born to defendant mother. The Merrimack County Superior Court (New Hampshire) transferred two questions to the present court: whether &sect; 460.29 violated the Equal Protection Clause and N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 2 and whether the trial court could issue child support and visitation orders under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 460.29.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother argued that &sect; 460.29 was unconstitutional because a mother could not file a petition for legitimation under the statute and because N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 168-A, which allowed a mother to petition to have a putative father charged with the support of a child born out of wedlock, prescribed that such a petition must be brought within two years from the date of birth of said child, while N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 460:29 contained no similar time limitation. The court stated that &sect; 460.29 did not impose additional support obligations upon a mother; thus, her situation was in no way similar to that of a father under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 168-A. Moreover, the court stated, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 460.29 did not give rights to a father that a mother did not already have under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 561:4 and 561:5. Next, the court held that the visitation rights of a father should not depend on legislative enactment. Furthermore, the court stated, the fact that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 460:29 did not include a child support enforcement provision did not bar the trial court from ordering child support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the legitimation statute was not unconstitutional and that the trial court had the discretion under it to issue child support and visitation orders. It remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Rockingham County (New Hampshire), which convicted him of criminal trespass and sentenced him to six months, two months suspended, in the house of corrections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested with other protestors. He was charged, convicted in the district court, and fined and sentenced to 15 days. Defendant appealed to the superior court and a jury found him guilty, he excepted to various rulings and instructions, and his sentence was increased. Defendant appealed based on erroneous jury instructions pertaining to reasonable doubt and the elements of criminal trespass under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 635:2. He also alleged abuse of discretion in sentencing. The court held that the instruction pertaining to reasonable doubt as a whole was not such error as to require a reversal and that the language, a strong and abiding conviction, remained did not work a reversal of the burden of proof, rather it required the state to remove it the issue of doubt. Further, the court found that taken in its entirety the instruction conveyed the correct concept of reasonable doubt. Also, the criminal trespass charge as a whole, made the requirement of knowledge of lack of privilege or license sufficiently clear, and it was improbable that the jury could have been misled by the trial judge's choice of words. Finally, the sentence was well within the guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding that no error had been committed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorneys challenged the system designed to compensate court-appointed counsel who represent indigent defendants. Under the statutory system, court-appointed attorneys' reimbursement could not have exceeded $ 10 per hours for case preparation and $ 15 per hour for time in court. The court found that the courts had the exclusive authority to determine the reasonableness of compensation for court-appointed counsel and held that N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 604-A:5 and 1975 N. H. Laws, ch. 505, &sect; 1.01(04)(05) intruded upon this judicial function in violation of the constitutional separation of powers mandate. The court held that N. H. Rev. Stat.

Laws, ch. 505, &sect; 1.01(04)(05) were unconstitutional insofar as they shifted much of the State's obligation to the legal profession and intruded impermissibly upon an exclusive judicial function. The court found that the attorneys should have been paid a reasonable fee, but one somewhat less than that which an ordinary fee-paying client would have paid.

The school resident was a severely retarded 39-year-old man who received medication daily, had no income and almost no financial resources, and had been deemed incompetent by inquisitors pursuant to a petition for the appointment of a guardian filed by the school. The State argued that the probate courts were obligated to obtain guardians when guardianship petitions were filed. The court held that the State was required to obtain guardians for incompetent institutionalized persons. The State's obligation was concomitant with its statutory duty to petition the probate court for the appointment of guardians. The administrator of the school was required to petition the probate court for the appointment of a guardian if the resident was over the age of 18 and was deemed incompetent.

However, the master made no findings whether the proposed development would comply with valid parts of the zoning ordinance. When a city building inspector told the developer that the property was in a zone that did not permit the proposed use, the developer filed a motion to amend its declaratory judgment petition to add a prayer for injunctive relief. After hearing the motion to amend, the trial court issued a decree enjoining the city from interfering with the development. The court vacated the decree. The city did not have adequate notice that the merits of the motion for injunctive relief, as distinguished from the motion to amend, was to be heard.

Defendants contended that the legislature did not have the power to prescribe the penalty of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for first degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were convicted of first degree murder. In order to be convicted of first-degree murder under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 630:1-a(II) (Supp. 1977), defendants must have purposely caused the death of another, requiring proof that the actor's conscious object was the death of another and that his act or acts in furtherance of that object were deliberate and premeditated. Upon conviction for first degree murder, defendants were required by N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 630:1-a(III) to be sentenced to life imprisonment and not to be eligible for parole at any time. On appeal, defendants challenged the power of the legislature to prescribe the penalty of life imprisonment without the possibility for parole for first degree murder. Defendants argued that the right to parole was guaranteed by the substantive aspect of the Due Process Clause and that life imprisonment without the possibility of parole constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that no right to parole existed in substantive due process. The court also concluded that life imprisonment without parole was not cruel and unusual punishment because it was not disproportionate to the crime for which it was imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court overruled defendants' exceptions and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The National Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-641, 88 Stat. 2225 (codified at 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 300k et seq., took effect on January 4, 1975. The Act restructured the delivery of health services in the states by consolidating a multitude of preexisting federal programs. Section 1521 of the Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 300m, required each participating state to establish a health planning and development agency as one of the principal vehicles by which health planning and regulation is executed. The governor of the state did not desire to select the Department of Health and Welfare as the agency to supervise the Office of Health Planning and Development (OHPD) to perform the functions under the Act. The court ruled that N.H. Const., pt. 1, art. 37 did not preclude the legislature from requiring the governor to make a particular designation of an agency to include the OHPD. Further, the Supremacy Clause did not preclude the legislature from requiring the governor to make the designation. The Act did not confer on the governor the right to disregard the state's constitutional processes in selecting the agency for the administration of the state health plan.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the general court could impose a contingent annual license fee on an operator of an oil terminal facility having a storage capacity in excess of 500 barrels, within the framework of the provisions of the Constitution of New Hampshire. The court found that the provisions of the proposed bill would not impose any unwarranted restrictions on interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause of the United States Constitution, to the extent that the tax did not in practice discriminate against foreign or interstate commerce.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State Senate requested an opinion relating to a proposed bill imposing limitations on oil suppliers: whether the general court within the provisions of the state constitution could have enacted a statute as proposed and whether any provision of the United States Constitution would have been violated by the bill. The court answered the first question in the affirmative and the second question in the negative. The court found that the general court could have reasonably concluded that suppliers' control of the retail gasoline market would have adversely affected free competition. The court found that the bill's requirements of uniform extension of voluntary allowances to dealers and equitable allocation of petroleum products would have prevented suppliers from giving favorable treatment to some retail dealers to the detriment of others. The court found that the bill involved neither a suspect classification nor a fundamental right. The court found that because the legislation would have promoted free and fair competition by eliminating suppliers from the retail marketplace, the classification was rational and sufficiently related to the achievement of the legislative goal.</SPAN></P>

The lower court reserved and transferred the case to the court without ruling on the questions of law presented.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the review of the board's decision concerning the taxpayer's business profits tax liability for two specified years, the parties filed an agreed statement of facts and the superior court reserved and transferred without ruling the questions of law presented. The court was called upon to consider the constitutionality of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-A:3 III (Supp. 1975), which set forth the income apportionment formula for business organizations doing business in the state and in one or more other states. In remanding, the court held that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-A:3 III (Supp. 1975) did not deprive the taxpayer of its property without due process, was not an undue burden on interstate commerce, did not violate the equal protection clause, and its &quot;throwback rule&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. Because the record was silent regarding the taxing powers of other foreign countries where the taxpayer delivered its products, the court was unable to determine whether or not such sales were properly allocated to the state under the &quot;throwback rule.&quot; The court remanded for the proper determination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded for a determination of whether the taxpayer was taxable in any of the states or foreign countries where it made sales.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested and charged with a violation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 268:25 (Supp. 1975) for operating without proof of financial responsibility. While being transported to jail, defendant gave to the deputy a belt buckle, which had a blade attached to it. Defendant was subsequently charged with a violation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 159:15 (Supp. 1975). The statute provided that if any person, when arrested for an alleged offense, was armed with certain dangerous weapons, he was guilty of a misdemeanor. Defendant claimed that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 159:15 was unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the statute did not threaten a fundamental right such as freedom of speech so as to require special judicial scrutiny.The court had no hesitation in saying that defendant's blade was a dangerous one. The court found further that, although doubts as to the applicability of the language of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 159:15 in marginal fact situations was conceivable, the statute gave defendant adequate warning that his instrument was a dangerous weapon within the meaning of N.H. Rev. Stat.

Rev. Stat. 356:1 I, III, IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an anti-trust action against defendant association, plaintiff issued subpoenas for certain documents. Defendant objected, arguing that the subpoenas were unconstitutional and failed to provide procedural safeguards. Plaintiff's motion to compel was granted. A series of exceptions and motions followed, which ultimately resulted in defendant petitioning for a writ of certiorari, arguing that the superior court exceeded its jurisdiction when it denied a motion for interlocutory review and that the order to compel discovery abused its discretion because the court did not rule on the constitutional issues. In considering the petition, the issue before the court was whether compliance with the discovery order would have prejudiced defendant to the point that it would not be able to obtain adequate relief upon an appeal after trial. The court denied the petition. It held that company records were not constitutionally protected against self-incrimination; therefore, no irreparable harm would result from compliance with the order.</SPAN></P>

When the crowd's attention appeared to wane, defendant used foul and derogatory language to refer to the members of council. After the dance was over, defendant was arrested and charged with rude and disorderly conduct pursuant to &sect; 570:1. On appeal, defendant contended that his speech was protected under the First Amendment. The court sustained defendant's exception and dismissed the State's complaint. The court held that defendant's speech was not &quot;fighting words&quot; because defendant's references were not to persons present at the time or to the police in general. Also, defendant did not exhort the crowd to violence, and there was no violent reaction to the speech beyond elevation of the noise level. Further, the State's police power did not overcome defendant's First Amendment right to free speech because any unwilling listeners could have retreated downstairs without forfeiting their right to return when the dance resumed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While an order prohibiting defendant from driving a motor vehicle was in effect, defendant was stopped when the automobile he was driving showed a defective taillight. The trial court convicted defendant of driving while certified an habitual offender pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 262-B:7 (Supp. 1973). At sentencing, defendant's motion for consideration of a suspended sentence was denied. Sentence was thereupon imposed for a term of not less than one year and not more than five years as provided by &sect; 262-B:7. Defendant appealed, contending that the mandatory sentencing provision of the Habitual Offenders Act, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 262-B:7 (Supp. 1973), constituted an improper legislative encroachment on judicial discretion in sentencing and that the Act violated constitutional prohibitions against disproportionate or cruel and unusual punishment under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 18; U.S. Const. amend. VIII. On appeal, the court held that the Act was not in violation of either N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 18 or U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Any amelioration of the mandatory sentencing provision of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 262-B:7 (Supp. 1973) was a legislative, not judicial, function.</SPAN></P>

Each defendant was convicted of rape and/or unnatural acts, depending upon the specific acts in which he engaged, and the trial court denied the motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court first held that the trial court did not err when it denied the motion for a new trial. The evidence did not permit the court to rule that the trial court was compelled to find that a different result on retrial was probable. The court then found that the trial court did not err when it ruled that the government was not required to disclose exculpatory evidence. There was no reasonable likelihood that it would affect the judgment of the jury and defendants did not make an explicit production request. With regard to defendants' assertion that the sexual acts were not unnatural according to modern social mores, the court decided that cunnilingus and fellatio were unnatural acts, as a matter of law, for purposes of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 579:9 (repealed by 1973 N.H. Laws ch. 532:26). The court overruled exceptions to the convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff victims challenged orders from the Superior Court, Grafton County (New Hampshire), granting the motions of defendant State of New Hampshire to dismiss their actions for negligence, as barred by sovereign immunity. The trial court reserved and transferred the victims' exceptions. The victims urged the court to reconsider and abolish the existing immunity of the State from liability for negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victims were injured when the truck in which they were riding crossed a bridge and the bridge collapsed. The victims brought negligence actions against the State that maintained the bridge. The trial court dismissed the claims because the State was immune from liability for torts. The victims raised exceptions, which the trial court reserved and transferred to the court. The victims urged the court to abolish the State's sovereign immunity. The court declined to do so. It explained that the doctrine of sovereign immunity was deeply entrenched in New Hampshire, and differed from municipal immunity that it had recently abolished. Striking a balance between granting relief to injured claimants and protecting the solvency of the State was a more complex problem than it was for most cities and towns. It involved extremely broad considerations of public policy and government administration. In this respect, the legislature's machinery was well adapted to conduct investigations and give consideration to plans advanced as a solution. Thus, the court concluded that it would be inappropriate for it to abrogate by judicial action the rules of state immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant premises owners, citing N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 556:10, appealed an order of the Hillsborough County Superior Court (New Hampshire) which granted plaintiff administratrix's motion to transfer an action initially brought by her decedent for personal injuries suffered in a fall without ruling on whether the limitations period of &sect; 556:10 violated the administratrix's right to equal protection of the laws under U.S. Const. amend XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 556:10, the time allowed for the administrator to be substituted after the decease of the plaintiff depended on the number of terms of the superior court in the county where the action was brought. The premises owners contended on appeal that the action was thus barred by limitations. The administratrix argued that &sect; 556:10 violated her right to equal protection of the laws. The court remanded the cause. The court observed that the difference in the time allowed bore no rational relationship to the statutory purpose of providing for the survival of pending tort actions and that as to those litigants in counties with three terms, the provision operated to defeat the statute's purpose to limit the extent of survival. The court determined that the differential impact of &sect; 556:10 violated the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection of the laws. The court held that the requirement that an administrator assume prosecution of the action before the end of the second term after the decease of the plaintiff was unconstitutional to the extent that it allowed administrators in counties with three terms less time to assume prosecution of actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the cause in the administratrix's negligence action against the premises owners for personal injuries suffered by her decedent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, at age 18, was convicted of the theft of a ping pong ball. Later, he sought annulment and vacation of the record. The trial court reserved and transferred the question of whether a trial court had the authority to grant the relief as to a sentence imposed prior to the enactment of the statute allowing for the relief. The court found that the New Hampshire criminal code was not to be construed strictly but to promote justice, as provided for by N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 625:3. Further, under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 625:2-II, a person prosecuted for an offense committed prior to the effective date of a code could elect to be prosecuted under the prior or the subsequent code. Thus, the court found that retroactive application of the statute in question did not violate N.H. Const. Art 23, pt. I that did not allow for such retroactive application. Further, the court rejected the prosecution's argument that the statute in question offended the Governor's pardon power. The court found that the relief allowed by the statute and that available under a gubernatorial pardon were very different.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the definition of obscene material in N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 571-A:1 (Supp. 1972) contained sufficiently rigorous standards to withstand constitutional scrutiny. Part (a) of &sect; 571-A:1 required that the predominant appeal be the &quot;prurient interest&quot; and specifically described such an interest as a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion. Part (b) of the statute required the material to go substantially beyond customary limits of candor in describing or representing nudity, sex or excretion. Finally, Part (c) of &sect; 571-A:1 required that the material be utterly without redeeming social importance. The court held that &sect; 571-A:1 was designed to limit regulation of obscenity to those materials which primarily sought to exploit unhealthy, antisocial attitudes toward sexual conduct, as defined above, by graphically depicting or representing such conduct in a patently offensive manner, leaving nothing to the imagination and having as a theme sex for the sake of sex alone. The court held that the statute was constitutional under the Miller decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation was in the process of liquidation. During the tax period involved in the case, the corporation owned shares of stock in various corporations, including two from New Hampshire. The corporation derived income from dividends on that stock. The court dismissed the petition. Although the corporation was formed for the purpose of managing an investment portfolio, it was a business organization as defined by N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-A:1. The corporation derived economic benefit from its intangible property and employed labor in the investment and distribution of its income. Also, the imposition of the business tax did not constitute double taxation of the income it derived from the receipt of dividends from the two New Hampshire corporations. Neither of the two corporations was subject to the same business tax that applied to the corporation. And, even if they were, no &quot;identity of taxation&quot; existed between the tax the New Hampshire corporations would pay on their profits before declaring a dividend and the tax that would apply to the dividends once they were received and included in the corporation's gross profits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the non-resident taxpayers were residents of Maine who earned income while working in New Hampshire. During the taxable year in question, the non-resident taxpayers earned income in New Hampshire, paid the commuters income tax, and then brought the instant declaratory judgment action, challenging the tax as violative of the Constitutions of the United States and New Hampshire. The court upheld the constitutionality of the tax, holding that because the tax was not discriminatory in its practical operation on the non-resident taxpayers, it was not violative of the privileges and immunities clause or the equal protection clause the federal or state constitutions. The court noted that the withholding and filing arrangements were necessary incidentals to administering the tax and did not create the &quot;substantial difference&quot; in treatment, which would have sustained the non-resident taxpayers' burden in proving the tax discriminatory to the point of being arbitrary and unreasonable. Additionally, the court held that the commuter's income tax was a tax upon the receipt of property in the form of income in New Hampshire and was, therefore, within the power of the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The governor promulgated executive orders that restricted the hiring of classified employees, banned the purchase of automobiles for State use, and restricted the transfers and promotions of State employees. The court held that a declaratory judgment action was appropriate because it was not an action against the State but was rather a proceeding to prevent the governor from enforcing orders that were claimed to be beyond his powers to promulgate. The court held that the executive orders were invalid and granted the declaratory judgment. The governor was exercising powers assigned by the constitution and statutes to the general court. There was no claim that the executive orders were occasioned by any failure in the faithful execution of the laws. The executive orders contravened the legislative intent expressed by the appropriations made by 1973 N.H. Laws ch. 376 for the hiring of new personnel and the purchase of automobiles. Insofar as the executive orders related to the classified personnel of the State, they contravened the powers of the general court granted by the constitution and exercised by enactments in N.H. Rev.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 318-B:26(I)(c) (Supp. 1972). Defendant contended, in part, that the police officer's affidavits did not establish probable cause for the search warrant under which his trailer was searched and 54.7 ounces of marijuana was seized.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One officer executed a probable cause affidavit that stated a confidential informant had purchased a substance identified as marijuana from defendant at the trailer. Another officer's affidavit was based on information received from a reliable confidential informant who had seen marijuana in the trailer. On appeal, the court held these affidavits were sufficient to support the search warrant. When defendant did not offer evidence to contradict an officer's testimony concerning custody of the drugs after seizure, the drugs were properly admitted into evidence. Testimony by the trailer's owner that he rented it to defendant, the presence of defendant in the trailer during the search, and the fact that the drugs were found in the closet and on the bureau of the bedroom established defendant's knowledge of, and control over, the drugs. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 318-B:22 (Supp. 1972), which required to prove his possession of the drugs was authorized, did not violate U.S. Const. amend. V and N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15 because the presumption of illegal possession was reasonable, given that the only entities authorized to possess drugs would not likely store them at a private dwelling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The creditor delivered trustee process writs to a deputy sheriff in order to begin an action on a promissory note. The deputy sheriff attached the debtor's checking account without notice to him and served a writ of summons on the debtor days later. The writ was returnable to a state district court. The debtor filed a petition to remove the action to the trial court under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 502-A:14 III. Prior to trial, the debtor filed a motion to vacate the attachment, which was denied. On appeal by the debtor, the court overruled the exception. The deputy sheriff attached the account pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 512:9-b, which did not require that any prior notice be given to the debtor. The court held that a prejudgment attachment of a person's checking account under &sect; 512:9-b by a sheriff at the request of a creditor without giving the person prior notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the validity or probable validity of such creditor's underlying claim violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city challenged a ruling from a trial court (New Hampshire), which granted injunctive relief under the Right to Know Law, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 91-A (Supp. 1972), to plaintiff economics professor in the professor's action to compel the city to release to him for study a computerized tape of field record cards related to real estate tax assessments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">To gather data for a college sponsored tax study, the professor sought the computerized tape of field record cards that the city had compiled for use in arriving at tax assessments. The city refused the professor's request on ground that the tape was not a public record. Even if it were, the city averred, the tape was exempt from disclosure under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 91-A:5 in that the tape contained confidential, commercial, or financial information, the disclosure of which would constitute invasion of privacy. The professor filed the instant action and prevailed. The city appealed, and the court overruled the city's exceptions. The court held that nothing in the information qualified as an invasion of privacy and that the city's argument that the information was within the statutory exemption from disclosure could not prevail. The trial court correctly ruled that the material sought was a public record within the meaning of &sect; 91-A:4 (Supp. 1972). Recent amendments to the Right to Know Law indicated a disposition to broaden the statute's scope and application. The professor should be permitted to have the tape reproduced at the professor's expense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court overruled the city's exceptions in the professor's action against the city to compel access to the computerized tapes and remanded the cause for appropriate action. The court held that allowing the professor access to the tape neither constituted a violation of privacy rights nor fell within the statutory exemptions from disclosure.</SPAN></P>

The action was submitted to the superior court of Belknap County (New Hampshire) and transferred without a ruling.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer assumed the shareholders' adjusted basis in the fixed assets under I.R.C. &sect; 362 (1954). The taxpayer sold the entire resort business. The taxpayer reported the gain in installments in its federal income tax return. Under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-A:1 III(a). The taxpayer filed its New Hampshire business profits tax return and applied to the tax commission for a determination of the basis for computing its business tax gain. The tax commission determined that the gain should be computed by using the federal adjusted basis. Remanding, the court found that it was constitutional for N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 77-A to use the federal adjusted basis to determine net taxable income. The court found that the legislature intended to incorporate by reference the federal income tax method of determining taxable income. The court found that the appreciation of the property before the year of sale was included in the taxable income because, under federal tax principles, the unrealized appreciation did not become profit before the taxpayer realized it through the sale.</SPAN></P>

The Senate proposed an amendment to the House bill that provided for voluntary silent meditation in place of the Lord's Prayer and asked the court to give its opinion as to the constitutionality of the proposed legislation. The court advised that the House bill, by encouraging and authorizing the daily recital of the Lord's Prayer in the public schools, sanctioned and encouraged a religious exercise to be conducted by teachers in the public schools and therefor was in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, the court found that neither the encouragement nor authorization of voluntary silent meditation nor a voluntary pledge of allegiance to the flag violated the First Amendment, and, thus, the proposed Senate amendment to the House bill was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 573.4 proscribed publicly mutilating, trampling upon, defiling, defacing, or casting contempt upon, either by words or acts a flag. Defendants contended that their convictions were void due to the unconstitutionality of &sect; 573.4, both on its face and as applied. The state prevailed. Section 573.4 was more narrowly drawn than some flag statutes. It dealt only with the flag itself or any flag or ensign evidently purporting to be the flag. Violations of the statute did not therefore depend upon the attitude or politics of the actor, but all who did the same act were treated alike regardless of their attitude. The specific acts prohibited or any similar acts upon the flag which ordinary men would know cast contempt upon it were within the orbit of the prohibition without regard to the purpose of the person committing the act.Section 573.4 was neither vague nor overbroad. The statute: was within the constitutional power of government; furthered an important governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression; imposed incidental restrictions on First Amendment freedom that were no greater than necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

At trial, defendant stated that his intent was to display the symbol as a protest against the war in Vietnam and to symbolize peace and American justice. On appeal the court held that: (1) &sect; 573:2 was not void for vagueness because it gave all persons, including law-enforcement authorities, adequate notice of its prohibitions and it restricted itself to certain specified and easily identifiable acts visited upon the flag itself and clearly defined the acts which were forbidden in a way that left no doubt what was prohibited and (2) &sect; 573:2 was not overbroad with respect to First Amendment rights of free speech because the statute in no way restricted pure speech and it placed no unconstitutional burden on &quot;symbolic speech&quot; since the acts prohibited by the statute were only those which affected the physical integrity of the flag, it was narrowly drawn and related only to the flag itself, and it did not prohibit the use of the colors, stripes, and stars in any arrangement or number or any representation of the flag.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The House of Representatives requested the opinion of the court on whether a pending house bill implementing a guaranteed protection plan of motor vehicle insurance was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One question concerned whether the federal or state constitutions would have been violated by the enactment of the provisions of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 407-C:9, which eliminated pain and suffering damages in personal injury claims arising out of auto accidents. Section 407-C:9 was a threshold provision which set a dollar amount of medical expenses below which injury victims would have been denied access to general damages except under certain conditions. The court concluded that the proposed provision would not have violated any constitutional provisions because it bore a reasonable relationship to the goal of eliminating congestion of the courts. However, the court concluded that the proposed N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 407-C:10 was unconstitutional. Section 407-C:10 authorized arbitration where damages were below $ 3,000. It provided the right to appeal from the arbitration but required an appellant to pre-pay the costs of arbitration, which would have been recoverable by the appellant if the appeal was successful. The court concluded that the requirement would have been an unreasonable condition on the right to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found a provision of the proposed legislation precluding pain and suffering damages if medical expenses were below a certain threshold to be constitutional. The court found a provision authorizing arbitration, but conditioning an appeal from arbitration on the pre-payment of costs, to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 318-B:26(II)(b) (Supp. 1972). She was 17 on the date of the alleged offense, and moved to be heard as a juvenile under the provisions of the Neglected and Delinquent Children statute, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 169. The Nashua District Court (New Hampshire) denied the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The last amendment to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 169 had the effect of extending the power to classify as &quot;delinquent&quot; wayward, disobedient, or uncontrolled 17-year-old children who otherwise could not be proceeded against as either juveniles or adults. The State did not allege that defendant was wayward, disobedient, or uncontrolled, and since 1965 all children of her age had been subject to treatment as adults for violations of the law. Defendant contended that by establishing these jurisdictional criteria ch. 169 denied her equal protection of the laws under the 14th Amendment because there was no reasonable basis for denying the protection of the act to defendant while extending such protection of the act to persons 17 years of age who were not charged with violating a law. The legislative choice to achieve its rehabilitative and protective purposes by reference to the age of a minor and the character of his or her behavior was certainly rational and consistent with constitutional principles. For this reason the court concluded that the ruling of the district court did not deprive defendant of her right to equal protection of the laws under the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court overruled the exceptions defendant took with the district court's denial of her motion to be heard as a juvenile, and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of attempted statutory rape and of attempted incest. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court had sufficient discretionary grounds to exclude defendant's witnesses from the courtroom during the alleged victim's testimony because there was a possibility of intimidating a child witness and of a subsequent coloring of the sequestered witnesses' testimony. The court held that defendant's indictment could not be challenged on the ground that only hearsay evidence was presented to the grand jury. The court found that defendant waived his argument related to the denial of a motion for a mistrial by failing to make a timely objection to the state's leading questions and by failing seasonably to move to strike witnesses' answers. The court held that the prosecution was permitted to charge and convict defendant of the lesser of the two felonies despite evidence of guilt on the greater. The court held that defendant's right to a speedy trial was not denied because the State did not attempt to cause the delay and defendant was not prejudiced by the delay.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 609-A:1(II) (Supp. 1972), which defined mob action as the assembly of two or more persons to do an unlawful act, was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and transferred the question to the court without ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants moved to dismiss their charges for failing to withdraw from a mob action after being commanded to do so by a police officer. Defendants argued that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 609-A:1(II) (Supp. 1972), which defined mob action as the assembly of two or more persons to do an unlawful act, was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The question was transferred without ruling to the court, which held that the statute was not vague and overbroad and was constitutional on its face. The court found that the &quot;to do&quot; and &quot;unlawful act&quot; language in &sect; 609-A:1(II) did not render the statute unconstitutionally vague. The statute prohibited only gatherings assembled for the specific purpose of imminently committing a crime in concert, resting firmly upon the valid and substantial state interest in protecting against riots and other unlawful, concerted activity. Since the statute at most restricted lawful protest demonstrations and other assemblies only incidentally and peripherally, it was not overbroad. The court concluded that the prohibition of unlawful assemblies did not tip the scales too heavily in favor of order at the expense of liberty.</SPAN></P>

She was charged as a principal under &sect; 585:14 for second-degree murder by administering a substance to the victim with the intent to procure a miscarriage, causing the death of the victim. She was also charged as an accomplice under &sect; 585:14 for second-degree murder in facilitating the commission of an offense in procuring an illegal miscarriage of an unquickened fetus under &sect; 585:12. The court held that the State could not prosecute defendant for second-degree murder under &sect; 585:14 for a violating &sect; 585:12 without alleging malice aforethought as provided by N.H. Rev.

The court concluded that the State could indict defendant for second-degree murder under &sect; 585:14 if it alleged malice aforethought or it could indict her for manslaughter under &sect; 585:8, but it could not prosecute defendant under the pending indictments.</SPAN></P>

After the guilty verdict, the trial court suspended imposition of sentence and transferred defendant's exceptions to &sect; 262-A:69-k, which permitted the admission of blood alcohol evidence without the operator if that presence was not requested. The court overruled defendant's exceptions because the reference in &sect; 262-A:69-k to the &quot;official report of said test&quot; showed a legislative intent to incorporate the common-law official written statements exception to the hearsay rule. The officially administered test was sufficiently trustworthy to permit admission of the test report as a public record without violation of defendant's constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him because the right to confront the operator was statutory and not constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff school board sought review of a decision by the Superior Court, Belknap County (New Hampshire), which denied the school board's requests in its petition for a declaratory judgment against defendant city to require the city council to increase its appropriation in the budget to the school board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The school board filed a petition for a declaratory judgment to require the city to increase its appropriations for the school board in the original budget. The trial court concluded that it should not intervene and denied the school board's requests. On appeal, the court agreed and issued a declaratory judgment, concluding that the city had control over all appropriations for education subject to at least two limitations. The city could not refuse to appropriate money for statutorily mandated service and programs, such as N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 189:1, 1-a, 12, 14-a, 24, 39, 198:1-3. The city also could not refuse to appropriate money to meet the minimum standards required by the State Board of Education. Thus, the school board was required to eliminate or reduce other programs that were desirable or optional but not mandatory as the appropriations in the city budget were sufficient for mandatory programs. The court stated that if a situation occurred where funds were not sufficient to meet the mandatory requirements, then it would be entitled to force the city to provide the funds for the required programs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ordered a declaratory judgment concluding that the city had appropriated funds sufficient to meet the State Board of Education's minimum standards and other statutory requirements and that the school board had the authority to determine the areas of the school district's budget that would be affected by the city council's reduction. If the budget fell below the required minimums, the school board could pursue further action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bill pending before the house was Senate Bill 103. It was an act authorizing the State of New Hampshire to acquire and dispose of industrial facilities. The House sought an opinion of the court regarding the constitutionality of the proposed act. In its answer to the first question proposed, the court answered that the proposed act was not unconstitutional as an authorization of an expenditure of public funds for other than a public purpose. The court noted that the stated purpose of the proposed act was essentially the same as those state in N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 162-D (Supp.), and therefore, the court found that the proposed act would serve a public purpose. As to the second and the third question, the court answering the questions in the negative concluded that there was no particular time or stage before the Authority can acquire the facility or issue any bonds therefor. The court answered yes to the fourth question regarding tax exemption because the authority of the legislature to exempt from taxation income from certain sources had not been questioned. The fifth and six questions were also answered affirmatively.</SPAN></P>

The trial court transferred all questions of law to the court on an agreed statement of facts without ruling by the trial court. The court held that the ordinance was invalid because the ordinance placed a restriction on a fundamental right of the city's employees to live where they wished and the requirement forcing the employees to live within the city did not serve a public interest which was important enough to justify the restriction on the private right. The court also noted that the qualifications of schoolteachers were certified by the State Board of Education and, once certified, they were entitled to pursue their calling anywhere in the State and their qualification to perform their important function did not depend upon their place of residence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant town sought review of a decision of the trial court, Belknap County (New Hampshire), which reversed a master's ruling against the corporations on their petition for a declaratory judgment under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 491:22. The petition was brought against the town, seeking a determination that a town ordinance regulating building heights was void, unconstitutional, without force of law, and inapplicable to the corporations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The town passed an ordinance restricting the height of buildings. The master ruled in favor of the town, but the trial court ruled in favor of the corporations. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court rejected the corporations' claim that there was ambiguity as to when the ordinance was adopted since this was cured at the following town meeting. The court found that the town's arguments that aesthetics or the appearance of a community, expanding summer season population, and protection of its shore line were all proper considerations laying foundation for the validity of the ordinance. The court also rejected the corporations claim that the town did not have authority to invoke the ordinance; the police powers granted to the town by &sect; 31:39 to protect its public institutions and to promote the general economy, welfare, and prosperity of the town, gave the town the power to enact the ordinance. The court held the corporations were not vested such that the ordinance did not apply to them since they knew that the town was pursing an ordinance to restrict the height of buildings, yet they continued to spend considerable money.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that the town's ordinance was valid against the corporations.</SPAN></P>
