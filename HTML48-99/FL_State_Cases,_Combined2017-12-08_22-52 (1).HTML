<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A prosecution against defendant attorney for unlawful solicitation of clients involved in motor vehicle accidents in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 817.234(9) was dismissed on the grounds that the statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the trial court was in error in granting the defendant's motion to dismiss predicated upon a finding that Fla. Stat. ch. 817.234(9) was unconstitutional on U.S. Const. amend. I grounds. The appellate court held that the record, including the information filed by the state, was insufficient to support such a finding. The court found that Fla. Stat. ch. 817.234(9) did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, where a rational basis existed for the disparate treatment of those who solicited motor vehicle claims. The appellate court reversed the dismissal predicated on First Amendment grounds and remanded with directions to permit the state to amend the information to specify what act or acts of defendant were alleged to have violated the statute. The appellate court reversed the dismissal as it pertained to the equal protection challenge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged the order of the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit (Florida) providing for visitation by appellee maternal grandparents of an out-of-wedlock child whose mother was dead, under Fla. Stat. ch. 752.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee maternal grandparents were awarded visitation of a child who had been born out of wedlock, but whose mother had died. Appellant father had been actively involved in the child's life, and the child had lived with him since the mother's death. The court found that appellees were relying upon Fla. Stats. ch. 752.01(d), providing for grandparent visitation rights where children were born out of wedlock. Based on the reasoning that Fla. Stats. ch. 752.01(e) had been held unconstitutional in the case of a child born into a marriage where the mother was deceased, because the father had a right of privacy, the court held that it followed that the father of an out-of-wedlock child had that same right of privacy. Fla. Stats. ch. 752.01(d) was therefore also unconstitutional. Further, appellees could not rely upon grandparent visitation provided by Fla. Stats. ch. 61.13(1)(a) because that was applicable only where there was a pending paternity proceeding, which was not true in the instant case. The lower court's order was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The applicable statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stats. ch. 752.01(d), violated the right of privacy of the appellant father and was therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged the order of the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) adopting the general master's report upholding appellee property appraiser's full valuation of appellant's building, although it was not substantially completed at the beginning of the tax year. The general master had found Fla. Stat. ch. 192.042, which provided that no value should be placed on buildings not substantially complete, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee property appraiser assessed the land and building of appellant taxpayer at its full value, although the building was not substantially completed. Appellant sought review by the value adjustment board, which reduced the valuation. Appellee brought an action in the lower court to defend his original assessment. The lower court appointed a general master hear the matter; his recommendation, adopted by the trial court, upheld the original assessment on the basis that Fla. Stat. ch. 192.042, which provided that no value be placed on a building not substantially completed, was unconstitutional. Appellant argued that appellee did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute. The appellate court noted that, where appellant brought the operation of a statute into question, appellee, a constitutional officer, did, in defense, have standing to question the validity of the statute. However, Fla. Stat. ch. 192.042 was constitutional because it did not create an additional exemption in violation of Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4, but merely related to the timing of the valuation and assessment of incomplete improvements to real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order upholding appellee property appraiser's full valuation of appellant's building. Because the building was not substantially completed, it should not have been assessed for that tax year, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 192.042.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee taxpayers filed a class action lawsuit against appellant state department of motor vehicles, contending that the Clean Outdoor Air Law, Fla. Stat. ch. 325.214, was unconstitutional because appellant assessed automobile inspection fees from the drivers of six counties but placed the fees in a fund earmarked for use by the entire state. Appellant sought to use its home venue privilege to transfer venue. Appellees claimed that the &quot;sword wielder exception&quot; prevented the transfer because appellant mandated that each motorist pass emissions inspection tests each year and pay registration fees. The trial court denied the motion to transfer. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for grant of the motion. The fee assessment was not an action justifying the application of the &quot;sword wielder exception&quot; because appellant had not yet enforced the statute against violators. Appellant was entitled to home venue privilege because appellees sought a determination of their rights under ch. 325.214.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), convicting appellant of attempted aggravated battery to cause great bodily harm and misdemeanor battery, finding that appellant was to be considered a gang member in order to enhance the sentence under the Criminal Street Gang Prevention Act of 1996, Fla. Stat. ch. 874.04, and sentencing appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution charged appellant juvenile with attempted aggravated battery to cause great bodily harm and misdemeanor battery. The prosecution moved under the Criminal Street Gang Prevention Act of 1996, Fla. Stat. ch. 874.04, to treat appellant as a gang member for sentence enhancement. Appellant alleged that ch. 874.04 was unconstitutional and moved to dismiss the enhancement motion, which the trial court denied. At the close of evidence, the trial court denied appellant's motion for acquittal upon the attempted aggravated battery charge. The court convicted appellant, found that appellant was a gang member, and enhanced the sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction as supported by the evidence but reversed the denial of appellant's motion to dismiss the enhancement request. The court held that ch. 874.04 was unconstitutional as no nexus was required between the criminal act and membership in a gang; chapter 874.04 thus improperly used non-criminal acts to enhance criminal sentencing. The court remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction but reversed the sentence and remanded for resentencing; the law providing for sentence enhancement upon a finding that a defendant was a gang member was unconstitutional because the prosecution was not obliged to show any connection between membership and the charged crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant committed a robbery less than one year after he was released from prison. The state sought an enhanced penalty for the robbery charge pursuant to the Prison Releasee Reoffender Act (Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082 (1997), which provided enhanced penalties for certain offenses committed within three years of release from a state correctional facility. Appellant pleaded no contest and was sentenced to 15 years in prison, pursuant to enhancements under the Act. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the Act, claiming it was ambiguous because it did not specifically include prisoners released prior to its effective date, and that it violated the single subject requirement of Fla. Const. Art. III, &sect; 6. On appeal, the court affirmed. The appellate court found that the all-inclusive language of the Act required no statutory interpretation and included appellant. Further, the statute did not violate the single subject requirement of the Florida Constitution. The court found no duplicity of subject matter because the preamble to the Act stated that its purpose was to impose stricter punishment on reoffenders, and each amended section of the statute dealt with reoffenders.</SPAN></P>

The commission refused to adopt the ordinance and, in accordance with the county's charter, it was therefore ordered to be placed on the ballot at the next general election. The plaintiff brought an action which challenged the proposed ordinance, asserting standing on the basis of its construction of a facility in the county which would be impacted by the ordinance. The lower court entered judgment for the defendants. The court held that since it was possible that the ordinance could become an element of a pollution control program administered by the county and approved by the department of environmental protection, the plaintiff failed to establish that the ordinance was unconstitutional on its face and in its entirety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, which entered judgment for the defendants, because the court found no error in the trial court's conclusion that the proposed ordinance was not a land development regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital battery and lewd and lascivious acts. His victim was 8 years old. First, a motion to suppress a statement was not preserved for appeal. Next, the court held there was no reversible error in the trial court's refusal to grant a motion for continuance based on an amendment to the information and on a last-minute change by the public defender's office in his legal representation. Last, defendant raised the issue, under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 or U.S. Const. art. VIII or Art. XIV, of whether the legislature had the power to impose a mandatory sentence of life without possibility of parole for the crime of penile union with the vagina of a girl less than 12 years of age when a defendant had no prior criminal record. The court based its decision upon a proportionality analysis guided by objective criteria, including: the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty, the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction, and the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions. The court held the punishment was neither unusual nor cruel and affirmed the convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the defendant's convictions of capital sexual battery and lewd and lascivious acts. Neither the conduct of law enforcement during pretrial interviews nor the events immediately preceding this trial resulted in preserved, reversible error. Moreover, a sentence of life with no possibility of parole was neither cruel nor unusual.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was convicted of battery, escape from a juvenile detention center, and grand theft. After the trial court imposed 18 months of community control when defendant admitted possession of marijuana following a five-year prison sentence, defendant appealed, claiming that community control combined with the prison sentence to violated a five-year maximum. On appeal, the court stated that sentences which exceeded the maximum were considered void to the extent that they exceeded the statutory maximum. The court reversed sentence and remanded for resentencing because the court agreed with defendant that his sentence exceeded the maximum period for the felonies he committed, and that constituted an illegal sentence. While testing positive for marijuana may qualify as a substantive violation, it was not clear whether the trial court in this case would have imposed the sentences it did based solely upon the allegations in an affidavit.</SPAN></P>

Appellee received damages for that claim in a separate proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former husband filed a petition for dissolution of marriage. Appellee former wife filed a counterpetition, alleging that during the marriage appellant had depleted marital assets in furtherance of an adulterous relationship.

The trial court entered judgment against the lover and awarded damages to appellee in a separate proceeding. The court later entered a judgment of dissolution and divided the marital property. Both appellant and appellee challenged. The court found that the trial court was wrong when it construed Fla. Stat. ch. 61.075(1)(i) as a statute of limitation and thus declined to consider appellant's intentional dissipation of marital assets more than two years before his filing for dissolution, when it made its equitable distribution order. The court also found that because the judgment against the lover was appellee's separate property, it should not have been treated by the trial court as a marital asset. Among other findings, the order was thus reversed in part and remanded for a recalculation of the equitable distribution award.</SPAN></P>

The court awarded workers' compensation benefits to appellee claimant.

The court held that appellee claimant was covered by the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 901 et seq., because he was injured while engaged in maritime employment upon actual navigable waters. The court said that where LHWCA applied, Florida workers' compensation benefits were expressly precluded under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.09(2). The court noted that state workers' compensation laws typically did not extend beyond the water's edge. Although the boundaries of the &quot;federal zone&quot; were imprecise, the court found that appellee claimant was clearly injured while working on navigable waters and was within the LHWCA coverage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After losing its certificate of exemption from state sales and use taxation on off-reservation purchases, appellee Indian tribe sued appellant department of revenue for declaratory and injunctive relief. Appellant filed a motion to transfer venue in accordance with the home venue privilege. The circuit court denied the motion finding that the privilege was waived because the suit was brought under section Fla. Stat. ch. 72.011 which provides for circuit court jurisdiction over actions in which taxpayers contest either the assessment of certain specified taxes or the denial of a refund of those taxes and specifically permits venue in such actions to be in the county where the taxpayer resides or maintains its principal commercial domicile. Appellant sought review and the court reversed after explaining that the fact that appellee had to pay sales tax could not be construed as an assessment within the meaning of ch. 72.011 because there had been no assessment against appellee nor had appellee been denied a refund. Because the action did not fall within a statute waiving appellant's home venue privilege, appellant was entitled to have the case transferred as requested.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following appellant's convictions of burglary of a dwelling with a battery and aggravated battery, appellant sought the court's review asserting, among other things, that the Prison Release Re-offender Act, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 775.082(8)(a) (1997) (the Act), was an ex post facto violation as applied to him. The court held that the Act provided for greater penalties for offenses committed within three years of release from a state correctional facility. Here, the Act increased the penalty for a crime committed by appellant after the Act, based on appellant's release from prison resulting from a conviction which occurred prior to the Act. As such, the situation was no different than a defendant receiving a stiffer sentence under a habitual offender law for a crime committed after the passage of the law, where the underlying convictions which gave the defendant habitual offender status occurred before the law was passed. In such circumstances, habitual offender laws did not constitute ex post facto law violations, and as a result, appellant's assertion was without merit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the lower court's grant of summary judgment to appellees, manufacturers of sandblasting equipment, in appellant's products liability action. Appellant claimed to have contracted silicosis from exposure to silica dust while he was employed as a sandblaster. The lower court had found that appellant's action was barred by a repealed products liability statute of repose, which eliminated any cause of action based on fraud or products liability filed more than 12 years after the fraud was committed or after the product was sold to its original purchaser. The appellate court determined that at the time appellant had surgery to remove a lung, he did not know that his illness was caused by his exposure and was told otherwise by his doctors. The appellate court determined that manifestation of the injury occurred when appellant was on notice of the causal connection between his exposure and his injury and that the question of when he should reasonably have been on notice of the connection was one for the jury. The appellate court concluded that the issue was an issue of fact and that, therefore, the trial court's grant of summary judgment was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurers in a consolidated appeal challenged the orders of the County Court for Orange County (Florida), which denied their motions to dismiss and compel arbitration and that declared a portion of Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(5) (1995) to be unconstitutional as violative of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's denial of appellant insurers' motions and held that the compelled arbitration clause in Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(5) (1995) violated the state constitution. The statute compelled arbitration of disputes between medical providers and insureds concerning the medical benefits available under personal injury protection insurance. Appellee medical care providers had been assigned the policy rights of persons injured in car accidents, and appellants had denied their claims. The court found that the statute violated substantive due process rights under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 because it denied appellees their Fla. Const. art. I &sect; 21 right to redress wrongs in court based on who owned the claim. Appellants were not required to submit to arbitration of their claims against insureds, but insureds were required to do so. Therefore, the statute was discriminatory. Moreover, the statute penalized medical providers compelled to arbitration because it substituted the prevailing party standard for obtaining attorney's fees in place of Fla. Stat. ch. 627.428(1) (1995), which controlled fee awards in litigation between insurers and their insureds in court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the lower court's finding that a law requiring appellee medical providers to submit to arbitration violated their due process rights under the state constitution because their access to the courts was limited by who they were, not the type of claim that they had. The appellate court concluded that the attorney fee provision was similarly unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of her conviction for the capital sexual battery of one of her sons in the Circuit Court, Duval County (Florida). Appellant contended the trial court erred by failing to make a statutorily sufficient, individualized determination of necessity that the child victim's testimony be presented at trial by means of his videotaped deposition, as opposed to his live, in-court testimony in the presence of appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury found appellant guilty of capital sexual battery on the basis of videotaped testimony by her son. Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 92.53(1) allowed the use of videotaped testimony where the court found that the child would suffer at least moderate emotional or mental harm due to the presence of defendant if required to testify in open court. However, the mere recitation that the child would suffer such harm was not sufficient in determining whether to allow such testimony and the lower court failed to state its findings as to pertinent facts in allowing the testimony. The error was not harmless because appellant's right of confrontation under U.S. Const. amend. VI had been violated and the case was remanded for the required determination. Appellant's assertion that evidence of similar sexual abuse by a sibling should not have been allowed was rejected because there was a relaxed standard of admissibility in the familial context for similar corroborating fact evidence where the charged and collateral offenses shared a unique combination of characteristics. However, on retrial the admissibility of such evidence was to be independently determined by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for capital sexual battery was reversed and remanded because the trial court's failure to state its findings as to pertinent facts in allowing appellant's son's videotaped testimony was a violation of appellant's constitutional right of confrontation. On remand, the trial court was to independently redetermine whether appellant's other son's similar corroborating fact evidence should be admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant automobile manufacturer sought to amend its franchise agreement with dealers in Florida. A group of dealers opposed to the proposed amendment filed a complaint with appellee state department of highway safety. Appellee initiated administrative proceedings and, thereafter, appellant brought an action challenging the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 320.641(3) (1995). A motion by appellee to dismiss appellant's action was granted because of the pending administrative proceedings. Appellant contended that the trial court violated its due process rights by ruling on a constitutional claim without affording adequate notice and opportunity to be heard. The appellate court reversed part of the judgment and remanded the case, finding that the administrative action could have no effect on the constitutional issue and, thus, it was pointless to require the time and expense of full administrative proceedings. The appellate court also held that the facial constitutionality of a statute could not be decided in an administrative hearing. Dismissal of the as-applied challenge was affirmed, however, where appellant was required to exhaust its administrative remedies on the claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owned property zoned commercial in front and residential in the rear and subject to legislative land-use restrictions. The property was located on a tributary of a river in an area designated by appellee as part of a hydrologic basin. Appellant wanted to develop a portion of the property and sought a management and storage of surface waters permit from appellee. Appellee denied the request, and appellant sued, claiming that appellee had no legislative authority to create the basin because the legislation relied upon unconstitutionally delegated such authority and alternatively, he sued to establish a regulatory taking. The court agreed with the trial court that appellee had the authority to designate the hydrological basin under valid statutes. However, the court found that the trial court was incorrect in ruling that appellant's regulatory taking claim was not ripe. The court found that despite appellee's argument that there was a chance that a modified application might be approved, appellee had made a final decision on the only application before it, so there was final agency action, and the issue of whether there had been a taking was properly before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the state of Florida, sought review of the judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Florida), which found that appellees', fishermen who had been charged with violating Fla. Const. Art. X, &sect; 16(b)(2), due process rights had been violated after it found Fla. Const. Art. X, &sect;&sect; 16(b)(1), (b)(2), (c)(1), (c)(3), and (c)(5) to be unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee fishermen were all individually charged with violating Fla. Const. Art.

Appellees each subsequently filed virtually identical motions to dismiss, challenging the provision of Fla. Const. Art. X, &sect;&sect; 16(b)(1), (b)(2), (c)(1), (c)(3), and (c)(5). After the cases were consolidated, the court below found the challenged provisions unconstitutionally vague in violation of appellee's rights to due process. The judgment of the court below was reversed on appeal because the court found that the language in the challenged constitutional provisions conveyed a sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practice. The court noted that on remand of the &sect; 16(b)(1) charges, the state's evidence must include proof that the fishermen were using prohibited gill or entangling nets. For purposes of the &sect; 16(b)(2) charges, the state had to include proof that the fishermen were using prohibited nets in waters three nautical miles seaward of the coastline or territorial sea base line in the Gulf of Mexico.</SPAN></P>

The court found that contrary to the trial court's determination and appellee's argument, Rule 46-31.0035(3)(b) did adequately apprise a person of the area in which fishing with a net containing more than 500 square feet of mesh area was prohibited. The court also found that contrary to the trial court's determination, the Marine Fisheries Commission did not exceed its rulemaking authority by using the term nautical mile instead of mile in Rule 46-31.0035 because common usage and understanding of the term mile, as used in the constitutional provision, was nautical mile.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dispute arose out of the city's refusal to allow a golf club to develop land. Citing zoning laws, the city denied the club's various requests to construct single-family dwellings on the property surrounding the golf course. The club, plaintiff, filed a complaint against the city seeking damages based on a taking without just compensation. The city brought a motion for summary judgment, and the court dismissed the action. Plaintiff appealed the dismissal of its takings claim based on the fifth amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V, its due process takings claim, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and its claim for declaratory relief. The court found that the trial court erred in dismissing claims based on the fifth and 14th amendments, and reversed those claims, but affirmed the dismissal of the claim for declaratory relief finding plaintiff was foreclosed from seeking that remedy. The court found dismissal of the fifth amendment claim should have been without prejudice to allow plaintiff to amend its complaint to assert which particular application of the city's plan amounted to an as-applied taking of the property. As to the 14th amendment claim, there were factual determinations in dispute.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 196.012(6), which was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant raceway applied for an ad valorem tax exemption under Fla. Stat. ch. 196.199. When appellee property appraiser denied the exemption, appellants, airport authority, raceway, and State, sought a declaratory judgment. All parties filed for summary judgment, which the trial court granted for appellees, property appraiser and tax authority. On appeal, the court affirmed the determination that a 1994 amendment to Fla. Stat. ch. 196.012(6) was unconstitutional. The disputed property was used as a for-profit racetrack. It fell within ch. 196.012(6), which was an impermissible attempt by the legislature to create additional tax exemptions not authorized by Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3. The classes of municipal property potentially exempt from ad valorem taxation included property used predominantly for educational, literary, scientific, religious or charitable purposes, economic development, renewable energy sources, and historic preservation. The constitution did not authorize the legislature, through enactment of general laws, to provide for municipal exemptions from ad valorem taxation for a sports facility operated on a for-profit basis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In April 1996, appellant committed the offense of sexual battery. Appellant was convicted of the crime and sentenced to 13 years incarceration. Appellant sought review. The court found that there was no improper substantive modification by the division of statutory revision in 1993 because in 1992 the legislature did not intend that sexual battery require any force or violence beyond the force or violence inherent in the accomplishment of penetration or union as those terms were defined in Fla. Stat. ch. 794.005. In addition, the court found that even if the division improperly modified the sexual battery statute in publishing session law chapter 93-156 in Fla. Stat. ch. 795.011(5), the error was cured in 1995 when the legislature adopted chapter 795.011(5) as the official law. The court declined to review appellant's alleged error regarding his sentence because he failed to preserve said error for review by not objecting to the scoresheet or moving to correct his sentence in the trial court pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(b). The court found that appellant might be entitled to postconviction relief pursuant to rule 3.800(b) or to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was sentenced to prison for armed robbery under Florida's 1995 sentencing guidelines. He appealed contending that the 1995 sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional because the enacting legislation, 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 184, violated the single subject rule contained in Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. The court concluded that the resolution of this issue would have a great effect on the proper administration of justice throughout the state and therefore, on its own motion, it certified that the issue required immediate resolution by the Florida Supreme Court under Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 3(b)(5). Chapter 184 contained civil provisions addressing domestic violence injunctions as well as the challenged sentencing guidelines. These provisions were not logically connected and there was no legislative statement of intent to implement comprehensive legislation to solve a crisis. However, the court declined to declare that the 1995 sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional because such a decision would impact the sentences of a large number of defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction for aggravated fleeing and eluding in contravention of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1935(2), arguing that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because there was no definition of &quot;high speed&quot; and because &quot;causes the law enforcement officer to engage&quot; was not explained. Additionally, defendant argued that the statute denied him due process because it assigned criminal liability for actions of a law enforcement officer. The court of appeals affirmed defendant's conviction. The evidence showed that during an investigatory stop by deputies, defendant raced his car out of the open gate of an otherwise enclosed water treatment plant compound, and fishtailed his way past one of the deputies, who testified that he would have been hit if he had not moved out of the way of defendant's car. A chase ensued that involved speeds as high as 118 m.p.h., and which ended 40 miles later after &quot;stop sticks&quot; deflated defendant's tires, causing him to fail to negotiate a turn, hit a pole, and land in a river. Based on those facts, the court held that defendant failed to show that the statute was constitutionally infirm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for aggravated fleeing and eluding was affirmed because, under the facts of the case, defendant failed to demonstrate that the statute prohibiting such conduct was unconstitutionally vague or denied him due process.</SPAN></P>

Appellants challenged that decision by arguing appellees exercised undue influence because they caused the estate holder to move near them and to execute new estate planning documents drafted by their attorney when estate holder was incompetent. The court noted that no evidence of the estate holder's incapacity existed, which indicated that no undue influence occurred in her change of estate planning documents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee grandmother sought visitation rights with the child of the deceased father, her son. Appellant mother challenged the constitutionality of the grandparent visitation statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 752.01(1)(a), (d). The court affirmed the order allowing visitation and upholding the constitutionality under ch. 752.01(1)(a), which permitted appellee visitation as the mother of a deceased, unwed parent. The court was bound by stare decisis to adhere to its prior decision finding the provision constitutional, but certified the issue for appeal based upon a conflict with another district court of appeal. The court found ch. 752.01(1)(d) facially unconstitutional and reversed that portion of the order granting visitation. The court agreed with the dissent in the case providing stare decisis on ch. 752.01(1)(a) that the provision interfered with rights protected in Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 and the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court certified the issues surrounding ch. 752.01(1)(d) for it was an issue of great public importance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Department of Business and Professional Regulation, issued Fla. Admin. Code R. 61D-2.002. Appellees, pari-mutuel wagering entities, contested the rule before an administrative law judge of the Division of Administrative Hearings. Appellees argued that the rule was not authorized by Fla. Stat. 550.0251 and its promulgation by appellant was an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority under the Administrative Procedures Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 120.52(8) (Supp. 1996) and ch. 120.536(1) (Supp. 1996). Appellees argued the rule's allowance of warrantless searches by appellant violated the U.S. Const. amend. IV. The judge issued an order invalidating the rule. Appellant challenged that determination by arguing the rule followed ch. 550.0251, was promulgated pursuant to ch. 120.52(8) and ch. 120.536(1), and did not violate U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court disagreed with appellant and affirmed the judge because ch. 550.0251 did not authorize the rule, the promulgation of which was an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority under ch. 120.52(8) and ch. 120.536(1) and which violated U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted appellant of workers' compensation fraud, grand theft, and perjury. On appeal, appellant complained of a number of improper prosecutorial comments made during closing argument in rebuttal to defense counsel's initial closing argument. He conceded that no objections to these comments were raised below, but he asserted that the comments constituted fundamental error. The court affirmed, holding that when viewed in the context of all the evidence presented and the initial arguments by defense counsel, any comments by the prosecutor which may not have been proper were not so egregious as to have impaired the ability of the jurors to decide the case based on the evidence. Appellant further contended that conviction for both workers' compensation fraud under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.105 and grand theft under Fla. Stat. ch. 812.014 was a double jeopardy violation. The court held that the plain reading of Fla. Stat. ch. 440.105(5) evidenced the legislature's intent to allow a conviction for workers' compensation fraud and any other applicable crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant condominium unit owner sought review from the Circuit Court for Brevard County (Florida) summary judgment for appellees husband and wife, arguing that the lower court erroneously concluded that Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon purchasing a condominium unit with an assigned garage and finding that appellant condominium unit owner was using the garage in question based on the purported conveyance of the garage from the previous owner of their unit, appellees husband and wife sought arbitration to enforce their claim on the garage. After an arbitration decision in appellees' favor, appellant filed suit, and the lower court entered summary judgment for appellees based on Fla. Stat. ch. 718.107 (1993). Appellant sought review. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 718.107(2) (1993) restrained the conveyance of all common elements appurtenant to a living unit, such that the garage in question could not have been conveyed to appellant. Further, the court held that even under appellant's own theory that the conveyance merely granted a license to appellant to use the garage, such a license was automatically extinguished upon sale or conveyance of the property in question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, holding that the statutory scheme made explicit the prohibition of conveyances of common elements such as the garage in question except insofar as they were conveyed with the sale of their attached unit to the new unit owner.</SPAN></P>

The court quashed the trial court's denials of the motions to transfer and found that Fla. Stat. ch. 985.227(3) was constitutional because the prohibition against ex post facto laws did not apply to procedural matters. Furthermore, the court's jurisdiction was not implicated, and transfers from juvenile court to adult court did not affect a substantial substantive right of the accused.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant neighbor, who did not get along with appellee neighbors, was enjoined from photographing or videotaping appellees or pretending to do so. He argued that the injunction was unconstitutional because it violated U.S. Const. amend. I. On review, the appellate court noted that the testimony showed that appellant had videotaped appellees on two to four occasions during the preceding four months when appellees were in their own yard or an adjoining area. Thus, the appellate court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the finding implicit in the injunction that appellant's conduct constituted stalking pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 784.048(2). In regard to appellant's arguments that his conduct was constitutionally protected, the appellate court cited a precedent case standing for the proposition that conduct which amounted to stalking was not protected by U.S. Const. amend. I. Thus, based on the foregoing precedent, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's injunction prohibiting appellant's photographing or videotaping of appellees.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's arguments that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and irrational, that the trial court committed error in denying his motion for acquittal, and that the trial court committed error in delivering a jury instruction requested by plaintiff state, were not preserved for review. The court also held that the trial court was justified in assessing points for victim injury even though penetration was not a direct result of any of the offenses charged because sexual penetration and, thus, victim injury, could have been a direct result of an offense proscribed by Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the decision from the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), which declared appellant to be a sexual predator under the Florida Sexual Predator's Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 775.21-23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed the state's motion to have him declared a sexual predator was unconstitutional as an ex post facto violation. The registration requirement of the 1995 Florida Sexual Predator's Act (Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 775.21-23, which the stated contended was applicable to appellant, was contained in the statute as it existed at the time of appellant's crime. Requiring appellant to register was not an ex post facto violation because even though the 1993 Act was repealed the registration requirement remained when provisions of the statute were reenacted. Registration requirements of sexual predator acts were generally regarded as regulatory and not punishment, and thus not subject to the prohibition against ex post facto laws. The community modification provisions of the sexual predator statute were not applied to appellant and therefore the court did not reach the issue of whether those provisions were more than regulatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's decision to declare appellant a sexual predator, finding the requirement that appellant register as a sexual predator did not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws because the registration requirement existed at the time of appellant's crime, despite the fact that the sexual predator statute had been repealed earlier.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant surviving children moved for a rehearing and/or clarification on an earlier opinion of their appeal of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), which granted summary judgment for appellee hospital and physicians based on Fla. Stat. ch. 768.21(1995) in appellants' wrongful death suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were the surviving adult children of decedent, who died, allegedly as a result of the medical malpractice of one or more of appellee medical center or appellee physicians. Appellants brought a wrongful death suit against appellees. The trial court granted summary judgment for appellees based on Fla. Stat. ch. 768.21 (1995). On appeal, appellants contended that ch. 768.21(8) was unconstitutional, as violative of the equal protection clause of both the federal and Florida constitutions. The court found that because the right to wrongful death damages was not a fundamental right, and those in appellants' position were not a suspect class, ch. 768.21(8) would be unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection only if the challenged classification bore no rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. The court found that the statute's disparate treatment of medical malpractice wrongful deaths did bear a rational relationship to the legitimate state interest of ensuring the accessibility of medical care to state residents by curtailing the skyrocketing medical malpractice insurance premiums in the state. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant surviving children's motion for a rehearing was denied, however the court granted appellants' motion for clarification. The judgment, which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee hospital and physicians, was affirmed because the statutory provision cited by the trial court was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant nurse worked in the Alzheimer's disease unit of a nursing facility. While on duty, appellant attempted to engage in oral sex with one of the patients under her care. The patient was diagnosed with organic brain syndrome. His memory and judgment centers were greatly damaged, and, as a result of his brain dysfunction, he demonstrated overtly sexual conduct. Appellant was charged with attempted sexual battery of a mentally defective person under Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(4)(e). At trial, appellant did not challenge the vagueness of ch. 794.011(4)(e). Instead, appellant contended that appellee prosecution failed to prove that the sexual activity was nonconsensual. After trial, appellant was convicted and sentenced. On review, appellant claimed ch. 794.011(4)(e) was unconstitutional because the term &quot;mentally defective,&quot; as defined in ch. 794.011(1)(b), failed a vagueness challenge. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence because the evidence appellee presented at trial demonstrated appellant's conduct fell within the conduct that ch. 794.011(4)(e) proscribed, and appellant was provided with adequate notice that her conduct was illegal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the trial court's order awarding plaintiff mortgagees interest payments during the pendency of parties' foreclosure proceedings, defendant mortgagor argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 702.10(2), the statute pursuant to which the interest payments were ordered, was unconstitutional. Reviewing the state law at issue, the court noted that the law required defendant either show cause why payments on the mortgage should not be made during the pendency of foreclosure proceedings or vacate the property at issue. The court held that, as the statute deprived defendant of property, it was required to comply with due process provisions. However, the court held that the statute failed to provide for a creditor bond to protect defendant from mistaken repossession or payment. Thus, the court held the statute was unconstitutional. The court also held the statute's provisions requiring defendant post an excessive bond to stay the payments unconstitutionally regulated matters of practice and procedure and improperly conflicted with procedural rules regarding bonds established by the state's supreme court. Thus, the court reversed the judgment awarding interest payments and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county argued that the trial court erred in construing Fla. Stat. &sect; 73.092(1)(a)(1995), a provision awarding attorney fees in eminent domain proceedings on the basis of benefits received for the client when the &quot;defendant&quot; hires an attorney. Specifically, appellant contended, the trial court's designation of the mortgagee, the prior landowner and the recipient of judgment proceeds -- rather than appellee, the current owner -- as the statutory defendant was improper for purposes of calculating benefits acquired for the client and in awarding appellee attorney fees. Because there was no difference between the final judgment and appellant's first written offer to appellee, appellant asserted, the benefits were zero and no attorney fees were required. The court disagreed, ruling that a &quot;reasonable attorney's fee for the defendant's attorney,&quot; in &sect; 73.11, referred to compensation due appellee, the property owner. The mortgagee did not have an interest in the mortgaged property, the court ruled, but only a chose in action creating a lien. The court concluded that the fee award satisfied the constitutional provision that appellee owner receive full compensation for a taking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed awarding appellee property owner attorney fees following a condemnation proceeding in which the mortgagee was the judgment recipient, because the statutory fee authorized for &quot;defendant's attorney&quot; was construed as compensation due appellee for a taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated battery and was sentenced as a violent career criminal pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(4)(c) (1995). He appealed, but the court rejected his appeal on the identical single subject challenge to 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 182. When appellant moved for rehearing, the court denied his motion but certified its decision as being in direct conflict with the second district court of appeal. The second district court of appeal had held 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 182 to be unconstitutional for violation of the single subject requirement of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6, and had invalidated a violent career criminal sentence on that basis. The effect of the second district court of appeal's ruling was to rule out a violent career criminal disposition for crimes committed between October 1, 1995 and May 24, 1997. Appellant committed the crime on December 30, 1995, and thus he would have fallen into the class entitled to relief if this case had proceeded in the second district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied appellant's motion for rehearing after it had denied his appeal because it found the single subject part of the violent career criminal statute did not render that statute unconstitutional. The court also recognized direct conflict with a decision from the second district court of appeal and certified the case on that basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee labor union sought declaratory relief against state officials for whom appellant governor was substituted. The trial court ruled that state employees who worked as attorneys had a fundamental right to collectively bargain which was unconstitutionally infringed by Fla. Stat. ch. 447.203(3)(j) (1997). The trial court found that appellant had a compelling interest in the lawyer-client relationship between the state and the attorneys it employed but that a complete ban on collective bargaining by state-employed lawyers was not necessary to protect that interest. The court affirmed because Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 provided public employees with the right to bargain collectively, and that the right was fundamental. The court found that the state had presented no evidence to support its position that government employed attorneys would abandon their ethical obligations if permitted to join a union and that it did not prove that a blanket ban on collective bargaining by government attorneys was the least onerous means of protecting the attorney-client relationship between the lawyers and the public entities which employed them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant veterinarian sought review of a decision of appellee State of Florida, Department of Business and Professional Regulation, Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering (division), which, on remand to impose a new penalty, sentenced the veterinarian to the same one-year suspension that had been imposed prior to the first appeal, but reduced the amount of the fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The division found that the veterinarian had violated a statute and a rule by drugging a racehorse in order to affect the race's outcome.

On remand, the division imposed the same one-year suspension, but reduced the amount of the fine. The veterinarian appealed, contending that the division erred in striking his memorandum and attachments citing the division's precedents reflecting that lighted penalties had been imposed in other horse drugging cases. In reversing and remanding, the court held that (1) the veterinarian was entitled to rely on precedents and it was error to strike that portion of the veterinarian's submission; (2) it was not error to strike the other information submitted by the veterinarian, which showed that after he was found in violation, the division had liberalized its policy on prosecuting the use of sodium bicarbonate on horses; and (3) the other information constituted new evidence and there was no authorization for an agency to reopen an administrative evidentiary hearing once it had been concluded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of attempting to procure a person under the age of 18 for prostitution. On appeal, the instant court stated that the test for sufficiency of the evidence was whether a rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the evidence met the test. Further, contrary to appellant's contention, the court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 796.03 (1993) was not unconstitutionally vague. While it was true that the term &quot;procure&quot; may mean to act as a &quot;pimp&quot; and not necessarily procure the person for oneself, it was also clear that &quot;procure&quot; may mean persuading, inducing, or prevailing upon the person to do something sexual for oneself. A reading of the statute reflected both definitions as being criminal conduct. This was especially true in light of the fact that the intent behind the statute was the state's compelling interest in protecting underage people from being sexually abused or exploited. The court held that the judgment should be affirmed, but the court remanded the case for correction because the charge against appellant was a third-degree felony and not a second-degree felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prosecution challenged an order of the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida) that granted appellee's motion to dismiss charges of driving while his license was suspended in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 322.34(1)(c), arguing that the circuit court erred in concluding that that statute was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power in violation of Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was charged with felony driving under a suspended license in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 322.34(1)(c) (1995), which declared a first or second conviction of driving with a suspended license to be a misdemeanor and a third conviction to be a felony. He moved to dismiss, and the circuit court granted the motion after concluding that the statute was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the judiciary because Fla. Stat. ch. 322.34(1)(c) required an adjudication of guilt for the conduct to be punishable as a felony and because Fla. Stat. ch. 948.01 allowed it to withhold an adjudication of guilt; as such, the circuit court reasoned that it had the unbridled discretion to make appellee's conduct a felony or a misdemeanor by simply exercising its discretion regarding the adjudication of guilt. Appellant prosecution sought review. In reversing, the appellate court concluded that Fla. Stat. ch. 322.34(1)(c), was not unconstitutional. A conviction under Fla. Stat. ch. 322.34 occurred after a final disposition of a case as a result of a trial or plea without regard to the court's decision on adjudication of defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a manufacturer of an asbestos product, sought review of the judgment from the 15th Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida) upon a jury verdict for appellee, a non-Florida resident who was injured by the product in states other than Florida. Appellant claimed that Florida was forum non conveniens under Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.061(a) (1997), and that the punitive damages were excessive under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.73(1) (1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a non-Florida resident, was injured by exposure to an asbestos-containing product on job sites in states other than Florida, but sued appellant, the manufacturer of that product, in Florida. Appellant's motion to dismiss the case based on forum non conveniens was dismissed by the trial court. A jury awarded appellee compensatory and punitive damages. On appeal, the court held that under Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.061(a) (1997), the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's forum non conveniens motion, because appellant waited three years after the complaint was filed before filing its motion, and the case was ready for trial. Because appellant agreed to have the jury decide the issue of punitive damages, and because the facts rebutted the presumption of Fla. Stat. ch. 768.73(1) (1993) that a punitive damage award over three times the amount of compensatory damages was excessive, the court found that the amount was proper. However, because the punitive damage award was greater than similar awards, the court affirmed the judgment, but certified the question of whether the amount of the punitive damages was excessive to the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of appellee, a non-resident injured in other states by an asbestos product manufactured by appellant, but certified the question of whether the amount of punitive damages was excessive, because appellant's three-year delay in seeking to dismiss the complaint based on forum non conveniens made the denial of its motion proper, and the facts made the amount of the damages, although unusually high, proper.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellee failed to comply with Fla. Stat. ch. 455.2273 (1997), requiring appellee to have in place guidelines for disciplinary actions and the imposition of related penalties. Therefore, the total lack of enforcement guidelines left appellant in a predicament ripe for arbitrary and erratic enforcement and provided no standards governed by the legislature as to constitute a judicially reviewable discretion. The court held that, absent the requisite guidelines, the appellee's order must be reversed. Appellant was entitled to notice of all matters that appellee would consider including the likely range of the penalty to be imposed against her. Further, any future action to create and apply penalty guidelines would constitute an improper ex post factor application of the law against appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 193.155(8)(a) was unconstitutional as contrary to Fla. Const. art.

Stat. ch. 193.155(8)(a) allowed for changes to the assessment for reasons not contained in the constitution. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court reasoned that a purported exception to a rule in Fla. Stat. ch. 193.155(8)(a) was not one provided for in the constitution and was, therefore, facially unconstitutional. Appellant argued that holding the statute at issue unconstitutional would result in inequitable taxation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant stepdaughter sought review of the decision from the Circuit Court for Alachua County (Florida), which dismissed her complaint with prejudice against appellee stepfather for sexual abuse because the four-year statute of limitations under Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(3)(o) (1987) had run.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant stepdaughter contended that the trial court should have applied the doctrine of delayed discovery of an injury to toll the four-year statute of limitations, Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(3)(o) (1987), in her action against appellee stepfather for the sexual abuse he committed upon her from the age of eight until she was 15. According to appellant she suffered from traumatic amnesia or a related syndrome, which explained the delay in commencing the action. Neither party brought to the attention of the trial court Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(7) (1993), which permitted the commencement of an abuse action within seven years after the abused person reached the age of majority, or within four years of leaving the dependency of abuser, or within four years from the time of discovery by the injured party of both the injury and the casual relationship between the injury and the abuse, whichever occurred later. The court held that in light of the fact that the trial court was unaware of the amendment, it properly dismissed appellant's case, but certified the question of whether the doctrine of delayed discover could be applied to toll the statute of limitations because of traumatic amnesia.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that appellant stepdaughter was precluded by the statute of limitations from maintaining a suit against appellee stepfather for sexual abuse committed when she was between the ages of eight and 15. However, because the court realized that there could be more than one way to interpret the case law applicable to tolling the statute of limitations, the court certified the question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner county issued a citation to respondent for failing to vaccinate his dog against rabies that year, in violation of the Dade County, Fla., Code &sect; 5-7. Although contested by respondent, the citation was upheld by a county hearing officer. Respondent appealed the hearing officer's decision to the appellate division of the circuit court. The appellate division heard the appeal, rejecting petitioner's argument that the appeal was properly for the county court's consideration, and not that of the appellate division of the circuit court. The appellate division reversed the hearing officer's decision and dismissed respondent's citation. Thereafter, petitioner county sought review by certiorari, on the ground that the appellate division was without jurisdiction to review the hearing officer's decision. The reviewing court quashed the appellate division's decision and remanded the case to the county court for a trial on the merits. The court ruled that petitioner's procedure with regard to challenges of animal control citations, which called for appeals of the hearing officer's decision by trial de novo in the county court, was constitutional and should have been followed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction by the Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida) for the offenses of armed burglary of a dwelling, armed robbery, and armed kidnapping, on the grounds that the hearsay exception for elderly and disabled adults found in Fla. Stat. ch. 90.803(24) (1995) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to trial for armed burglary of a dwelling, armed robbery, and armed kidnapping, appellee state notified appellant of its intent to admit statements of the victim, an elderly man who had died prior to trial, under the Elderly Person or Disabled Adult hearsay exception of Fla. Stat. ch. 90.803(24) (1995). Appellant moved to have the statute declared unconstitutional on claims that the statute offended the confrontation clause of U.S. Const. amend. XI and that its application denied due process guaranteed by U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV and Fla. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9. The trial court refused to declare the statute unconstitutional and appellant entered a nolo contrendre plea and preserved the right to challenge his conviction on this ground. The appellate court held that it could not rule on the statute's constitutionality as applied because the trial court did not make full findings. The court found, however, that the trial court entered findings that the victim met the definition of elderly person, that he was unavailable, and that the statements were corroborated. The court affirmed appellant's conviction because he did not point to any grave deficiencies in the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction because he failed to point to any grave deficiencies in the statute or its application that would cause the court to be concerned with constitutional questions. The court also held that it could not rule on the constitutionality of the statute because the trial court did not make full findings.</SPAN></P>

The judge responded that he was not in possession of such a report and had no information about it. Appellants made no objection to proceeding in the absence of the report, but on appeal they argued that it was error to proceed given the lack of review by a medical advisory panel. Appellee responded that there was no fundamental error and that appellants were required to object in the trial court. The court agreed with appellees and affirmed the judgment. The court reasoned that appellants' failure to object during the hearing constituted a waiver, and that fundamental error had to be equivalent to a denial of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery with a firearm, aggravated battery, and being a felon in possession of a firearm. The court sentenced defendant under Fla. Laws ch. 95-182 as a violent career criminal to life imprisonment on the first two counts and at least 30 years imprisonment on the third count. Defendant appealed her sentence, claiming that ch. 95-182 was unconstitutional because it violated the single subject requirement of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. The appellate court held that ch. 95-182 was unconstitutional and reversed defendant's sentence. Art. III, &sect; 6 provided that every law shall embrace but one subject. Various sections of ch. 95-182 dealt with sentencing procedures for violent career criminals, civil aspects of domestic violence, substantive and procedural rules regulating private damages actions brought by victims of domestic abuse, and procedural duties of the court clerk and sheriff regarding the filing and enforcement of domestic violence injunctions. Ch. 95-182 joined together criminal and civil subjects that had no natural or logical connection.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant country club sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), which granted summary judgment to appellee county in appellant's complaint for inverse condemnation and for violation of its due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled, on appellant country club's complaint for inverse condemnation, that the claim was ripe for review, that there had been no total temporary taking by appellee county of appellant's property, and that appellant's vested right to develop the property in connection with the then-existing comprehensive plan did not rise to the level of a constitutionally protected property interest. Explaining, the court ruled that because appellee refused to consider appellant's application for rezoning under the applicable 1980 plan, in view of appellee's mandate that development plans satisfy an incipient comprehensive plan, it would have been futile for appellant to file another application under the incipient plan. However, appellee's action in enacting an ordinance that would refuse to certify applications inconsistent with the incipient plan did not constitute a partial taking, as appellant was not deprived of a substantially economic beneficial use of the property. Because there was a plausible basis for appellee to pass the ordinance, so as to bar development inconsistent with the incipient plan, appellant suffered no deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed granting summary judgment to appellee county in appellant country club's complaint for inverse condemnation and for violation of its due process rights, because no total temporary taking by appellee of appellant's property had occurred and because appellant's vested right to develop its property in connection with then-existing comprehensive plan did not rise to level of constitutionally protected property interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile was found delinquent after disrupting a school function and committing the offense of affray, fighting in a public place to the terror of the people. Defendant then appealed, challenging the affray statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 870.01(1) (1995), as unconstitutionally vague, and arguing various other errors. The court held that the term affray was defined with sufficient definiteness that the statute was not impermissibly vague. Further, the court held that the lower court had not been required to ask for a second restrictiveness level recommendation after rejecting the first one, but found that the lower court's failure to distinguish between defendant's two offenses in pronouncing sentence and failure to specify the term of community control or maximum term of commitment required remand for clarification. Finally, the court held that the lower court's oral pronouncement that a fine would be waived required that the fine be struck on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the statute was constitutional but that the vagueness of the sentencing required clarification, and finding that the lower court's failure to conform its imposition of a fine to its earlier oral pronouncement required that the fine be struck.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license.

The appeals court affirmed appellant's sentence. According to the appeals court, although section 921.001(5) allowed for the imposition of sentence that exceeded the statutory maximum, the section was still valid. In finding section 921.001(5) constitutional, the appeals court held that section 921.001(5) stood for the unremarkable proposition that the sentencing guidelines could trump the statutory maximum otherwise set by law. The appeals court held that a maximum sentence could be determined in any case simply by completing a sentencing guidelines score sheet, as such, section 921.001(5) provided adequate notice of the potential penalties for an offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, in his capacity as Executive Director of the Florida Commission on Human Relations, sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), which held unconstitutional a portion of the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992, Fla. Stat. ch. 760.11(7), in appellee employee's declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee employee filed a sexual discrimination claim with the state commission on human relations (the commission). When the claim was denied pursuant to a no-cause finding, appellee did not file an administrative complaint under Fla. Stat. ch. 760.11(7) to challenge the ruling. Instead, appellee filed a declaratory judgment action against appellant, executive director of the commission, seeking to have ch. 760.11(7) declared unconstitutional. The trial court held that ch. 760.11(7) was unconstitutional, but the appellate court reversed and remanded the judgment. The court held that ch. 760.11(7) was not unconstitutional as an improper restriction of the right of access to the courts. Appellee had no constitutional right of access for her discrimination claim because it was not a common law claim. The court also found that the claim was insufficient to support an equal protection violation. The statute did not contain any classification, which discriminated between charging parties. Further, any alleged disparate treatment was rationally related to the permissible governmental purpose of avoiding court docket congestion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a father whose deceased wife's parents successfully obtained visitation rights with appellant's four-year-old daughter under Fla. Stat. ch. 752.01(1)(a), challenged the constitutionality of trial court's order granting visitation. On review, the appellate court held that Fla.

Const. art. 1, &sect; 23. The statute was flawed because it required the trial court to award reasonable visitation rights merely upon a showing of the best interest of the child without a prior showing that demonstrable harm would result if appellees could not visit with the child. Noting conflict with other state appellate courts, the appeals court ruled in favor of appellant, quashed the trial court's order, and certified the question for review by the state's highest court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee abortion clinics brought suit against appellant state to have the Women's Right to Know Act (Act), Fla.

The trial court temporarily enjoined enforcement of the Act on constitutional grounds pending a final hearing. Appellant sought review of the non-final order. Affirming, the court held that the right of privacy under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 afforded a greater protection than the right of privacy under the federal constitution and demanded the compelling state interest standard. Under established authority, the court held, the state did not have a compelling interest in the health of a pregnant woman during the first trimester, or in a fetus before it was viable. The court also reminded that laws regulating a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy were subject to the strict scrutiny test of constitutionality. Focusing on the Act's informed consent provisions, Fla. Stat. ch. 390.0111(3)(a)1 (1997), the court concluded that appellees had sufficiently established a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits to support the temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged an order of the trial court that enjoined the holding of a city referendum to repeal an ordinance passed by the city commission authorizing the sale of a 72-acre tract of municipal land that included an auditorium to appellees. In granting the injunction, the trial court considered the charter provision providing for a referendum but determined that under case law it did not apply to administrative ordinances. The appellate court held that the ordinance was the proper subject of the referendum under the Florida Constitution, state statutes, and the city charter and code. In addition, the court perceived no conflict with any Florida statute in the provision for the disposition of municipal property by ordinance. Therefore, the court reversed the order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The judgment of the lower court was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court affirmed the lower court finding that denied agricultural classification for the natural woodlands. The court found there was insufficient evidence of any actual forestry operations on the lands in question.

The court reversed and remanded because matters involving custody and visitation in paternity actions should be based on the best interest of the child as in dissolution proceedings, and Fla. Stat. ch. 61.13(2)(b)(2)(c) (1995) provided for grandparental visitation in a dissolution proceeding if such visitation was in the child's best interest.

At appellant's trial, testimony was presented that the department of motor vehicle extensively advertised the new license classifications. Notification was mailed to all chauffeur's license holders. The scheme appeared on the back of all licenses, and appellant's license was re-issued while the new classifications were in effect. Appellant was found guilty. On appeal, the court stated that to be charged under Fla. Stat. ch. 322.34(3)(b), appellant's license had to be suspended, canceled, or revoked because of some wrongdoing. Appellant's negligence in operating the vehicle could only enhance some willful act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a part-time newspaper columnist, filed a petition for writ of certiorari from the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Martin County (Florida). Defendant claimed that plaintiff corporation was required to give her pre-suit notice under Fla. Stat. ch. 770.01 (1995) prior to filing a libel action against her and that plaintiff failed to comply with this statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought a libel action for statements contained in two of defendant's newspaper columns. Plaintiff claimed that the publications were libelous because defendant allegedly implied that plaintiff was the same corporation as a defunct and discredited corporation. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss asserting that plaintiff failed to comply with the statutory notice requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 770.01 (1995), which defendant claimed was a condition precedent to plaintiff's libel action. Plaintiff claimed that this statute did not apply to defendant because she was a part-time columnist and was not newspaper entity. The legal question posed by defendant's petition for writ of certiorari was whether a columnist for a local newspaper was entitled to pre-suit notice pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 770.01 (1995) before plaintiff could file its libel action. The court determined that the plain language of the statute made no distinction between suits against the newspaper itself and the individuals who wrote for it.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of an order by the Circuit Court for Escambia County (Florida), which dismissed an information charging appellee with a violation of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state charged appellee with driving a motor vehicle with a suspended or revoked license under Fla. Stat. ch. 322.34(1)(c) (1995) when he had previous convictions for driving violations. The trial court dismissed the charge on the basis that the statute unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to the judiciary to determine whether the charge was a misdemeanor or a felony. Appellant contended that the trial court's order was based upon flawed reasoning. The court, in agreement, reversed and remanded the case. Under the statutory scheme, treating a violation of ch. 322.34(1)(c) as a misdemeanor was not an available alternative. A person whose adjudication was withheld pending completion of probation was not a convicted person. If probation was revoked, adjudication of guilt as to the offense was required. Thus, ch. 322.34(1)(c) did not involve an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded, because the trial court erred in finding that appellant state's criminal charges against appellee stemmed from an unconstitutional statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery with a firearm, theft of a motor vehicle, and aggravated fleeing and eluding. On appeal, defendant argued that after the robbery took place, the state supreme court made a substantive change in the standard jury instruction on principals, making it easier for the state to obtain a conviction, and that the trial court's use of the new instruction was an ex post facto law violation. The appellate court held that the use of the new instruction, which enabled the state to establish guilt without two elements contained in the prior instruction, was an ex post facto violation. Nevertheless, the court affirmed the conviction, finding that the use of the new instruction was harmless error. The state presented extensive evidence, and its primary position was that defendant was a substantial participant in the crimes, not merely a principal. Besides defendant's confession, there was other overwhelming evidence of his guilt as an active participant, not as a principal, which led the court to conclude that the use of the new instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

He alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it violated his due process rights as it imposed a criminal penalty without requiring the state to show criminal intent. Appellant reasoned that these objects had legitimate household uses, so it was impermissible to criminalize simple possession of ordinary household goods. On appeal, the court held that the ordinance passed constitutional muster because it did not place an outright ban on the possession of these objects by minors; rather it allowed minors to possess them on public property if accompanied by an adult or on private property with the owner's consent. Also, there were instances where public interest required the prohibition of innocent acts in order to secure enforcement of the laws against evil acts. The court then held that it was permissible for the court to treat minors differently from adults. Finally, the court maintained that the possession of spray paint and jumbo markers did not implicate a fundamental right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adjudication of delinquency was affirmed because the anti-graffiti ordinance under which appellant juvenile was prosecuted was constitutional and enforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant out-of-state corporation sent product catalogs to Florida customers. Appellee state department of revenue assessed a use tax on the catalogs in addition to the sales tax on the mail order sales. Appellant filed an action challenging the assessment, and the trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that because the catalogs were items of tangible property that were distributed in Florida, they were subject to the use tax under Fla. Stat. ch. 212.05(1)(b), ch. 212.06(1)(a), and ch. 212.06(6) (1987) whether or not a customer purchased anything from the catalogs. The court held that even if the newspaper and religious exemptions to the use tax under Fla. Stat. ch. 212,08(7)(w) (Supp. 1988) and 212.06(9) (1987) were unconstitutional, under Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee news media challenged the constitutionality of the exemption provided for in Fla. Stat. ch. 395.3035(4) (1995), which provided that portions of appellant public hospital's governing board meetings be closed when confidential contracts or strategic plans were discussed. Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 24(a) provided for open meetings, but the legislature was authorized to provide exemptions if such law stated with specificity the public necessity justifying the exemption and such exemption was no broader than necessary to accomplish the stated purpose of the law. The trial court found the exemption to Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 24(a) contained in the statute was unconstitutional. To determine if the exemption was no broader than necessary, the court looked to the exemption and its duration. There was no statutory limit of what could be discussed during closed portion of meeting. There was no definition of, and therefore no limitation on what could be included in a strategic plan. The court held that at the very least, the term &quot;strategic plan&quot; should have been defined.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former husband's and appellee former wife's final judgment of dissolution provided that appellant would pay child support and 100 percent of medical expenses not covered by insurance. Appellant petitioned for modification of child support alleging that there had been a substantial change in his financial circumstances warranting a downward modification of his obligation. Appellant also contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 61.30(12) was unconstitutional. The trial court found that there was no substantial change in circumstances which would justify a reduction in the former husband's child support obligations and that the statute was constitutional. On appeal, the court agreed that the statute was constitutional as it furthered a legitimate state interest, assuring that noncustodial parents continued to support children from their first marriage notwithstanding their obligation to support subsequently born children. The court agreed there was no substantial change warranting a reduction in child support but remanded the matter for the trial court to consider a reduction in child support for the extended visitation granted to appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying appellant former husband modification of his child support obligation was affirmed in part as there was no substantial change in circumstances warranting reduction and was reversed regarding reduction in medical expense reimbursement paid by appellant. Further the matter was remanded for the lower court to consider a reduction in support for the extended visitation granted appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a medical malpractice action against appellees, physicians and institute, for a medical procedure that took place on December 18, 1990. Appellant alleged he discovered the negligence in December 1993 and on December 16, 1994, appellant filed a petition under Fla. Stat. ch. 766.104(2) for an automatic 90-day extension of the two-year statute of limitations. In March 1995, appellant served notice of his intent to initiate litigation and on April 17, 1995, appellant served an amended notice adding appellee institute. Appellant's initial complaint was filed in July 1995, and an amended complaint adding appellee physician was filed in September 1995. The lower court dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice and held that appellant's amended action was barred because appellant was required to file suit by January 29, 1995. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the order holding that the 90-day extension and the notice of intent to initiate malpractice litigation under Fla. Stat. chs. 766.104(2) and 766.106(4) extended the statute of limitation and the statute of repose. The court also certified the question for appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought workers' compensation benefits including payment of medical and pharmaceutical bills and attorney's fees and costs. The Judge of Compensation Claims (JCC) dismissed his petition on the grounds that his exclusive remedy for benefits not already furnished was under a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which established an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) system. Appellant challenged the ruling. The court affirmed. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.211(2)(1995) the JCC lacked jurisdiction over compensation claims when the CBA met the statutory criteria. The JCC viewed the jurisdictional issue correctly in considering only the narrow question: whether the CBA supplanted provisions of ch. 440 that would otherwise apply to appellant's claim, in the posture she found the case when the jurisdictional determination had to be made. The court refused to disturb her determination that the CBA's established ADR system was intended to supplant chs. 440.25 and 440.271 whenever litigation would otherwise be required to establish entitlement to or the amount of an attorney's fee that an employer allegedly owed an employee's attorney.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the denial of his motion and the trial court's subsequent adjudication of defendant as delinquent. The court affirmed, concluding that the knife did not fall within the definition of common pocketknife. Although the knife was a pocketknife, it had distinctive features that were not characteristic of a typical, ordinary, pocketknife but were characteristic of a weapon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' action was filed pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 163.3215 (1995) and sought a declaratory judgment that a development action taken by defendant county was inconsistent with the comprehensive plan. Defendant developer was permitted to intervene and the trial court granted its motion to review the action of the county in its appellate capacity rather than by conducting a trial de novo. The trial court upheld defendant county's action and plaintiffs appealed. The court reversed, holding that Fla. Stat. ch. 163.3215 (1995) provided for a trial de novo in the trial court. Construing the statute to provide for review by writ of certiorari would be contrary to rules of appellate procedure which required that petitions for review must be filed within 30 days of the order to be reviewed. In contrast, Fla. Stat. ch. 163.3215 (1995) contained a pre-suit filing requirement, requiring the challenging party to file a complaint with the local government before filing a lawsuit. This meant that the suit in circuit court would be filed up to 90 days after the issuance of the development order, which would be contrary to the 30-day requirement of Fla. R. App. P. 9.100(c)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded for a trial de novo because the statute authorizing plaintiffs' suit provided for a trial de novo in cases challenging actions of local governments. If the statute were to be construed as providing only for appellate review by the trial court it would be contrary to the rules of appellate procedure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Escambia County (Florida) convicting appellant upon a plea of nolo contendere to aggravated fleeing and eluding, resisting arrest without violence, and driving with a suspended license. Appellant asserted that Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1935(2), prohibiting fleeing and eluding an officer, was unconstitutionally vague on its face because it did not provide adequate notice of proscribed conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was spotted by a police officer driving the wrong way down a one-way street with his car headlights off. The officer attempted to stop appellant with his police cruiser, but appellant maneuvered around the cruiser. The officer pursued appellant down several streets at high speeds, but appellant refused to yield until he wrecked his car. Appellant fled on foot, but was apprehended by police. Appellant was charged with aggravated fleeing and eluding, resisting arrest without violence, and driving with a suspended license. Appellant moved to dismiss the fleeing and eluding charge on constitutional grounds, which was denied. Appellant entered a plea of nolo contendere, preserving his right to appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed judgment convicting appellant because Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1935(2), which prohibited fleeing and eluding a police officer, was constitutional on its face because it gave fair notice of the conduct proscribed. The court held that consideration of the facts as applied to determining the facial validity of the statute was appropriate, because Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1935(2) did not purport to regulate any constitutionally protected activity.</SPAN></P>

The trial court prohibited testimony by a witness on the standard of care for internists, finding that the witness was a general practitioner, not an expert as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 766.102(2)(b) (1991). On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case for a new trial. The witness met the criteria for a specialist in internal medicine under the statute, so the trial court erred in precluding his testimony. Appellants failed to show, however that ch. 768.21(8) (1991) was unconstitutional because it provided that adult children could not recover damages in wrongful death actions stemming from medical malpractice. The statute did not deny federal and state constitutional guarantees of equal protection of the laws and due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee State of Florida charged appellants corporations with operating illegal bingo operations and violating state gambling laws. Appellee state of Florida filed a motion with the trial court to impose a temporary injunction against appellants from operating bingo operations and freezing their bank accounts. The trial judge, without giving notice to appellants, granted appellee's motion, and imposed a temporary injunction. Appellants filed a motion to lift the temporary injunction, arguing that it was unwarranted, and requested that appellee post a bond during the judicial proceeding, for any damages they may incur. The trial judge refused to lift the injunction but ordered appellee to post the bond. Both parties challenged the ruling. The court held that appellee was entitled to a temporary injunction against appellants, because their actions constituted serious violations of the law, and certified a legal question to the state supreme court. The court also upheld the trial judge's order for the bond, stating that the law permitted appellants to recover damages from appellee if they won their case and therefore the bond requirement was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual performance by a child and was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment followed by 15 years' probation.

The trial court then did enter a modified order of probation prohibiting appellant from any unsupervised contact with children under the age of 18. After appellant admitted that he had verbal contact with some minors, his probation was revoked.

Appellant's conviction for armed burglary with a firearm was reversed because the jury instruction relied on a circular definition of burglary. The court affirmed the aggravated assault conviction as a lesser-included offense, as there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction on the greater offense of attempted second-degree murder with a firearm.

The trial court found that &sect; 817.36 was constitutional, and dismissed nine counts of the criminal information on double jeopardy grounds. On review, the court found statutes like &sect; 817.36 were designed to prevent unfair cornering of the market and limit opportunities to manipulate prices; therefore, this was legitimate area in which the state could impose economic regulations. Further, the court found that appellee had been punished in a prior civil forfeiture proceedings based on the RICO statute. However, that forfeiture proceeding did not impose punishment in the sense of implicating the double jeopardy clause. Rather, such forfeiture proceedings were viewed as independent of any factually related criminal action.

The appellants sought review, asserting that ch. 775.21 violated the constitutional prohibition against the enactment of ex post facto laws and that the trial court had no jurisdiction to label them as sexual predators because the declaration modified their sentences more the 60 days after imposition in violation of Fla.

The state prosecuted the offense as a felony because defendant had three prior convictions for the same offense. Defendant moved to dismiss the charge, contending that ch. 322.34(1) was unconstitutional because it allowed the trial court to determine whether the offense was a misdemeanor or felony. The trial court denied his motion. Defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere, and trial court adjudicated him as guilty of the felony offense. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed, concluding the statute was constitutional. The dispositive issue was whether defendant's violation of ch. 322.34(1) was a conviction when the sentencing court decided to withhold an adjudication of guilt instead of entering a judgment against defendant. The court determined it was, therefore defendant's argument failed because all his prior violations of the statute counted in determining whether the violation was a felony. One may be convicted without being adjudicated guilty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father and mother appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), which granted visitation rights to appellees, the maternal grandparents of appellant husband's biological daughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower court granting visitation rights to appellee maternal grandparents was affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case was remanded upon the appeal of the judgment by appellants, the biological father and the adoptive mother of the child at issue. On appeal, the court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 752.01(1)(a) (1995) satisfied the requirements of the Fla. Const. The court found that allowing limited visitation to grandparents after a parent has died promoted a compelling state interest in protecting the emotional well being of children. The court further found that appellees were entitled to visitation pursuant to the above statute but that the scope of the visitation order was overly broad. The court found that allowing appellees to take an active role in the child's religious education overstepped the bounds of the court's discretion. Thus, the court affirmed the lower court's order permitting visitation by appellees because it was in the child's best interests. However, the court reversed and remanded the case to the lower court for reconsideration of the extent and scope of what constituted reasonable visitation under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. Appellant prosecution filed a motion in limine to introduce into evidence a breath test result affidavit prepared pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1934(5) (1995). Appellant's motion was denied, and appellant sought review of the non-final order. The court reversed judgment and granted appellant's motion in limine to introduce a breath test result affidavit, because a breath test result affidavit was admissible in evidence without further proof of maintenance of the intoxilyzer as an exception to the hearsay rule for public records and reports, pursuant to Fla.

Appellant and the state entered into an agreement in which appellant retained only the most offshore portion of the original area to which the leases pertained and retained residual royalty interest in near shore portions until 2016. The settlement required appellant to continue to pay rents on areas where it retained an active interest, to comply with environmental regulations in effect at the time of drilling, to release all interests to the state in the year 2016, and to not interfere in any state land use decisions. The state legislature passed Fla. Stat. ch. 377.242 (1990), prohibiting further oil exploration and leases in the near shore area. Appellant filed an action in which it sought compensation for the alleged taking of its royalty interests.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation leased real property and then subleased the premises for a fixed rental amount to charitable organizations for the conduct and play of bingo games. Appellant filed a declaratory judgment action against appellee city and challenged the ordinance that regulated the play and conduct of bingo games in the city limits because it conflicted with Fla. Stat. ch. 849.0931 and on various constitutional grounds. The circuit court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that although the ordinance went further than the statute in the regulation of bingo, the ordinance did not conflict with the statute. There were no provisions in the statute that indicated the legislature intended that bingo be uniform across the state. Thus, the court found that the constitutional challenges to the ordinance were without merit and the ordinance was valid.</SPAN></P>

Although the ordinance placed greater regulations on bingo, it was not in conflict with the state law nor was the ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied appellants' motion to dismiss the complaint and their alternative motion to transfer venue. On appeal, the court reversed and held the trial court abused its discretion by denying appellants' motion to transfer and the sword wielder exception was inapplicable because appellant department of revenue issued no notice or warrant to appellees and thus no official action had been taken on the part of appellants other than the filing of motions in response to appellees' suit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, family members of a deceased, sued defendants, hospital and health services corporation, for committing malpractice when the deceased gave birth.

Defendants sought a stay of the award during their appeal, and a trial judge refused, and upheld the award. Defendants challenged the ruling, arguing that the arbitrator could only make one award to the entire class of plaintiffs, rather than to each plaintiff, and that economic damages were not permitted. The court held that defendants were not entitled to a stay while they appealed, because the purpose of arbitration was to pay in a quick manner. The court also determined that the arbitrator overstepped his bounds when he awarded each plaintiff an award for malpractice, rather than give one award to the entire class. The court upheld the award of non-economic damages, attorneys fees, and payment over 10 years, stating that the arbitrator's decision complied with the law on these issues.</SPAN></P>

Respondent patient was later diagnosed with AIDS. The malpractice complaint filed by respondents, patient and her family, named the obstetrician and petitioner blood bank as defendants. Several years after respondents had filed their lawsuit, petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the complaint based on respondents' noncompliance with Fla. Stat. ch. 766.106, the medical malpractice presuit requirements. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss. Petitioner argued that although the medical malpractice statute of limitations did not apply to actions against blood banks, respondents nevertheless were bound to comply with the presuit requirements. The court denied petitioner's request for a writ of certiorari because, without a clear expression of legislative intent to the contrary, the court interpreted the applicable statutes as excluding blood banks from the malpractice presuit requirements in actions against them as suppliers of contaminated blood, where they had not rendered any treatment or care.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner blood bank's request for a writ of certiorari because petitioner was not a health care provider for the purpose of requiring respondents, patient and her family, to comply with the medical malpractice presuit requirements.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a state agency, in two consolidated cases, sought review of the orders from the Circuit Court for Lee County (Florida) that denied its motion to change the venue to its home county on the complaints of appellees, commercial fishermen who gave their nets to appellant in exchange for a promise for certain sum of money pursuant to the buy back program of Fla. Stat. ch. 370.0805 (1995), but received less than the promised amount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees in two consolidated cases were commercial fishermen who were subject to Fla. Const. art. X, &sect;&sect; 16(a) and 16(b)(1)-(2), which limited the type of nets that could be used in fishing. Therefore, pursuant to the net buy-back program of Fla. Stat. ch. 370.0805 (1995), appellees met with employees of appellant, a state agency, in appellees' county and agreed to sell appellant their nets for a specified sum. Appellant took the nets, but sent vouchers for lesser amount. Appellees sued appellant in their county, and the trial court denied appellant's motion to have the cases transferred to appellant's home county. On appeal, the court held that appellant's right to have the cases heard in its county was limited by the sword wielder doctrine. Because ch. 370.0805 (1995) indicated that the nets remained appellees' property until appellant paid for them, appellees' property rights in the nets were protected by Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. Because appellant went to appellees' county to take the nets, and because the complaint alleged that appellant violated their constitutional right to their property, the sword wielder doctrine applied. Therefore, the court affirmed the orders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders denying appellant state agency's motion to change the venue of appellee fishermen's consolidated cases to appellant's home county, because the allegations that appellant went to appellees' county, took their nets pursuant to a statute, then broke its promise to pay an agreed upon amount, thus violating appellees' constitutional rights to their property, made the sword wielder doctrine applicable.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 491.0112(4)(b) (1993), which prohibited sexual misconduct by means of a therapeutic deception, which was defined to mean a representation to the client that sexual contact by the psychotherapist was consistent with or part of the client's treatment. The lower court convicted appellant, and he sought review. The court found the trial court properly denied appellant's motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence demonstrated a prima facie case that appellant used therapeutic deception to convince the female victim to engage in sexual conduct. The court found testimony from a former patient was properly admitted into testimony as a prior act. Fla. Stat. ch. 90.404(2)(a) allowed evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts to be admissible when it was relevant to prove a material fact in issue, such as proof of motive, opportunity, or intent. Because the testimony from the former patient was admitted to prove a common scheme, it was relevant. The court found Fla. Stat. ch. 491.0112 (1993) was not overbroad because there was not an absolute fundamental constitutional right to engage in any type of sexual behavior.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellant state appealed from an order of the County Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida) that dismissed the criminal misdemeanor filed against appellee corporation and appellee vice president and based upon the purported noncompliance with permits issued by the Department of Environmental Protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee corporation and vice president obtained a permit to conduct a dredge and fill operation. Appellee was required to notify the state before commencement of the work and place safety measures into effect before the work. Appellees failed to comply with the requirements. Appellant prosecutor charged appellees with two misdemeanor violations of Fla. Stat. ch. 403.161(1)(b) (1995). The trial court dismissed the information and found Fla. Stat. ch. 403.161(1)(b) (1995) was unconstitutional. The court reversed and remanded because in order for the court to declare a legislative delegation of power invalid, the court was required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the duty conferred was a power that was exclusively legislative. The authority to make administrative rules was not a delegation of legislative power, nor were such rules raised from an administrative to a legislative character because the violation was a public offense. The court found that the state administrative agency was subject to express legislative control and guidance. Fla. Stat. ch. 403.161(1)(b) (1995) was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to an administrative agency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the lower court was reversed because the legislature did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority to a state agency. The agency was subject to express legislative control and guidance, and it was the state's public policy to preserve and protect the water.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion for rehearing on the motion to suppress, and the lower court suppressed the evidence. The court reversed because the police officer's encounter with defendant was consensual, because a reasonable person would have felt free to disregard the police and go about their business. A consensual encounter did not require the police to have a reasonable suspicion of any improper conduct before conversation was initiated. The court reversed because the presence of the police officers on the porch where defendant was sitting was no different than a consensual encounter and the police did not even have time to speak before defendant voluntarily dropped the bags of drugs.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed a decision from the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida), which convicted him of robbery with a deadly weapon, attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, trespass with a dangerous weapon, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and simple assault, based, in part, on proof that defendant used a BB pistol during all of the offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court determined that the evidence was sufficient to support criminal defendant's convictions. The appellate court held that it was proper for the jury to find that the BB pistol was a dangerous or deadly weapon where defendant's words and actions implied that the device was dangerous or deadly, irrespective of the fact that the device was not normally dangerous or deadly when used in its ordinary and usual manner and was not, at the time of the offenses, not dangerous or deadly due to its unloaded condition, which could not have been observed by the victims. The appellate court noted that various witnesses had testified that they thought that the BB pistol was a real firearm and that defendant had carried and used the weapon as if it were loaded and had himself referred to the BB pistol as a &quot;weapon&quot; or &quot;gun.&quot; The appellate court upheld the limited reliance upon a reasonable victim's perspective regarding the likelihood of injury and affirmed, noting that nothing visible to any victim in the case would have led a rational person to concluded that the BB pistol was not a loaded and operable, deadly or dangerous weapon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant originally pled nolo contendere to the charge of issuing a worthless check, a third-degree felony. Defendant received a guidelines sentence, within the statutory maximum, followed by a term of probation. Defendant subsequently violated his community control, and the trial court revoked his community control and imposed a habitual offender sentence of imprisonment. Defendant did not directly appeal this sentence, but after the time for appeal lapsed he brought a collateral attack, arguing that the habitual offender sentence, imposed after revocation of his community control, was both unauthorized and illegal pursuant to precedent. The trial court denied collateral relief. On appeal, a state appellate court reversed. The court opined that the precedent cited by defendant, under which habitual offender sentences were prohibited in the situation faced by defendant, was retroactively applicable. Accordingly, defendant's sentence was vacated pursuant to that precedent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state sought review of a decision from the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Martin County (Florida), which dismissed the three counts of the information against criminal defendant that alleged his violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 827.071(5) (1995) for possessing pornographic computer images of an actual child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court reversed the trial court's decision to dismiss the counts of the indictment that charged criminal defendant with violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 827.071(5) (1995) for his possession of pornographic images of an actual child. The appellate court determined that a computer image constituted a &quot;representation or other presentation&quot; under the statute, noting that the pornographic images also could qualify under Fla. Stat. ch. 827.071(5) as copies of photographs. The appellate court then found that under the doctrine of ejusdem generis, the term &quot;representation or other presentation&quot; included computer images as items that were similar in nature to a photograph or motion picture, noting that the trial court's usage of qualifying terms that were not found in the statutory language served to rewrite the law and to limit its terms in a manner contrary to its plain language. The appellate court concluded by holding that there was no inherent conflict between Fla. Stat. ch.  827.071(5) and Fla. Stat. ch. 827.0135, as the trial court had determined, given that a review of the two statutes indicated that each contained an element not present in the other.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for trafficking in cocaine, because the court found that the lower court erred in refusing to reopen cross-examination of the prosecution's key witness. The court found that the lower court should have allowed defendant to reopen cross-examination of appellee's lead detective for the purpose of introducing into evidence additional tape recordings of conversations between defendant and appellee's informant. The court found that it was fatal error for the lower court to deny defense counsel the right of cross-examination for the purpose of laying a predicate for impeachment. Further, the court held that, because appellee had introduced a portion of the tape recorded conversations, defendant should have been allowed to introduce other relevant portions, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 90.108 (1995). In respect to the lower court's instruction regarding entrapment, the court held that the lower court should have used the most current jury instruction available and advised the court to do so on remand.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the claims against appellees, state board of regents, bank, and state comptroller. The appellate court affirmed, holding that appellant failed to allege facts that appellees, state board of regents, bank, and state comptroller, harbored evil intent as to their actions or that they had knowledge that appellant was entitled to the payment of annual leave. Furthermore, appellees, state board of regents and state comptroller, were immune from the action because of sovereign immunity. The court also ruled that the negligence action against appellees, state board of regents and bank, was precluded by the economic loss rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint against appellees, state board of regents, bank, and state comptroller. The court found that appellant professor's claims of civil theft and negligence for the withdrawal of his annual leave pay from his bank account did not allege facts to sustain the cause of action against appellees, and that appellant's claims were precluded by sovereign immunity and the economic loss rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of two counts of aggravated assault that arose from a single criminal episode. Appellant was sentenced to ten years imprisonment on count one and six years on count two. Appellant moved the court to correct his sentence under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a), and contended that the sentence was illegal because the maximum allowed for aggravated assault was ten years imprisonment. The court denied appellant's motion because the sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum and was thus, not illegal under rule 3.800(a). On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. A sentence was not illegal within the meaning of rule 3.800(a), if it did not exceed the maximum period allowed by law. A single sentence for aggravated assault could not exceed ten years and neither of appellant's single sentences exceeded ten years. Appellant's sentence was not illegal, so he was not entitle to relief under rule 3.800(a).</SPAN></P>

Consideration of appellant's unfair labor practice charges did not require the commission to adjudicate the constitutionality of any statute or rule.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After her brother's arrest at school, appellant juvenile, along with several other students, stormed into the main office yelling obscenities at the arresting officer.

Appellant was charged with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 877.13(1995), which makes it unlawful for anyone to knowingly disrupt or interfere with the lawful administration or functions of an educational institution. Appellant was found guilty and challenged the statute as facially unconstitutional. The court affirmed appellant's delinquency order. The court held that ch. 877.13 did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I because only conduct that materially disrupted normal school functions was proscribed. The court found that the statute was not overly broad because the prohibited disturbances were easily measured by their impact on school activities. The court held that ch. 877.13 was not vague because the plain meaning of the statute prohibited acts that were intended to stop normal school functions.</SPAN></P>

For several years prior to appellee owning the park, the park was in violation of zoning codes because mobile homes had been placed on the lot, and such practice continued after ownership of the park transferred to appellee. The court held that under Fla. Stat. ch. 162.09 (1995), code violations run with and the land, and therefore, appellee, as a subsequent purchaser of the park, could be held responsible for bringing the property up to code. The court held that 162.09 was not unconstitutional by requiring the party who has the power to bring the land into code compliance to do so. The court found that a hearing was held pursuant to 162.09, and appellee was given time to obtain the necessary permit or variance, and where appellee failed to do so, it was properly fined each day for its noncompliance.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion to dismiss the perjury charge but ruled that materiality was an issue to be determined by a jury. In so doing, the trial court struck as unconstitutional the last sentence of the statute, which provided that in perjury prosecutions materiality was a question of law to be determined by the court. The appellate court denied the petition, holding that although Fla. Stat. ch. 837.011(3) provided a definition of materiality in perjury prosecutions and stated that whether a matter was material in a given factual situation was a question of law, the recitation did not remove the issue from the jury. The appellate court held that the lower court correctly determined that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was denied because state case law had acknowledged that materiality was an element of the crime of perjury, and because materiality was an element of the crime, the lower court correctly determined that petitioner was entitled to have the issue submitted to the jury and correctly determined that the state statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged the order of the County Court for Hillsborough County (Florida), that dismissed the charge against appellee bar manager on the basis that Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(7)(a)(5) (1995), which formed the basis for the charge, was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state charged appellee bar manager with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(7)(a)(5) (1995), which made it unlawful for any person to keep or maintain a place of business where drug use and drug trafficking occurred. In his motion to dismiss, appellee alleged that the statute was impermissibly vague and overbroad because it failed to define the terms &quot;keep or maintain&quot; and individuals of common intelligence would need to guess the meaning of the terms and their application. The trial court granted the motion and found that the statute violated equal protection and resulted in an unconstitutional deprivation of due process. Appellant challenged that ruling. The court held that drug use or trafficking was not a protected conduct for which one was constitutionally entitled to privacy. The court held that &quot;overbroad&quot; and &quot;vague&quot; were not one the same, but were separate and distinct doctrines of constitutional rights. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the plain meaning of the words &quot;keep&quot; or &quot;maintain&quot; was sufficiently clear and contemplated conducting a business enterprise such as that maintained by appellee to put him on notice that he violated the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's judgment, which found the statute that forbade &quot;keeping or maintaining&quot; a place of business where drug trafficking occurred unconstitutional, and remanded for further proceedings. The court concluded that the statute was facially constitutional because, even though the terms &quot;keeping and maintaining&quot; were not defined in the statute, the plain meaning of the language was clear.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a juvenile, was charged with possession and exhibition of a firearm on school property.

On review, appellant challenged the constitutionality of section 39.0517(2) and whether there was sufficient evidence to support the court's order of confinement. The appeals court affirmed the judgment. First, the appeals court held that the statute was constitutional and that the statute did not require the court to appoint a psychiatrist before it could commit appellant. Moreover, the appeals court held that appellant was treated the same as adult incompetent defendants for purposes of determining competency. The appeals court held that the rules pertaining to adult defendants did not require a psychiatrist. The appeals court then held that there was sufficient evidence to support the lower court's order. According to the appeals court, the appellate task on reviewing a trial court's finding based on clear and convincing evidence was not to reweigh the testimony and evidence or to substitute the court's judgment for that of the trier of fact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of a nonfinal order from the County Court for Sarasota County (Florida), which granted a motion in limine in four consolidated driving while under the influence cases and suppressed breath alcohol evidence provided by an Intoxilyzer 5000 breath test instrument in order to require the effective the dismissal of all charges against appellee suspects alleging a violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193(1)(b) (1995).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court reversed the suppression orders, holding that the phrase &quot;breath alcohol level of 0.08 percent or higher&quot; in Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193(1)(b) (1995) was to be interpreted as meaning &quot;grams per 210 liters of breath&quot; instead of the asserted mathematical definition. The appellate court found that practical information about the Intoxilyzer 500 and other breath test instruments indicated that the term &quot;percent&quot; on that equipment referred to the universal 1:2100 ratio of alcohol in human blood to alcohol in that person's breath. The appellate court further noted that once the state legislature had been made aware of the manufacturer's change of the readout of its equipment, in recognition of the confusion surrounding the term &quot;percent,&quot; it had updated the statute to replace &quot;percent&quot; with &quot;grams per 210 liters.&quot; The appellate court concluded by remanding the consolidated cases for new trials, finding that criminal defendants' erroneous calculations of blood alcohol content, under their interpretation of the statute, were not sustainable because they resulted in an absurd interpretation of the charging statute, which was to be avoided.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile sought review of her adjudication as a delinquent child and subsequent disposition for violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 39.061, which proscribed escape from various juvenile facilities. Appellant specifically argued that the trial court should have dismissed the petition alleging that she had committed a delinquent act because ch. 39.061 did not proscribe escape from low-risk residential commitment facilities as defined by Fla. Stat. ch. 39.061(59)(b). Alternatively, appellant argued, if the statute did proscribe escape from such facilities, its terms were unconstitutionally vague. In particular, she contended that ch. 39.061(59)(b) failed to provide adequate notice that leaving a low-risk residential facility was a delinquent act. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's adjudication of appellant as a delinquent child. The appellate court held that ch. 39.061 was not so vague that persons of common intelligence would be unable to determine what conduct was proscribed. The court found that ch. 39.061 was intended to proscribe escapes from commitment facilities of all four residential restrictiveness levels.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county government entered into a contractual agreement with appellee power company whereby appellee could provide electrical services in appellant's jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee tried to obtain information about recent suspicious activity in his neighborhood by falsely identifying himself as a deputy sheriff to two of his neighbors. Appellee was charged with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 843.08 by falsely assuming or pretending to be a deputy sheriff. Appellee moved to declare chapter 843.08 as unconstitutional based on its vagueness and overbreadth and to dismiss the charge against him. The trial court granted appellee's motion to dismiss and appellant state sought review. The court held that chapter 843.08 was not so imprecise as to require individuals to guess at its meaning. The court found that appellee's actions clearly fell within the plain meaning of chapter 843.08 because said chapter prohibited appellee from falsely assuming the persona of a law enforcement officer and acting as such.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant public official sought review of an order of the Florida Commission on Ethics, which adopted a hearing officer's findings of fact and conclusion that appellant had violated Fla. Stat. ch. 112.313(6) by engaging in unwanted sexually or romantically oriented behavior toward a subordinate female employee and recommended the imposition of a civil monetary penalty and a public censure and reprimand to remedy appellant's wrongful actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court reversed the decision and recommendations from the state ethics commission on the ground that the commission failed to comply with Fla.

The appellate court found that the commission had erred in applying the preponderance of evidence standard, noting that the clear and convincing standard was more appropriate because of the penal nature inherent in finding a violation of the state ethics code and because the penalties at stake included the loss of livelihood and professional reputation. Accordingly, the appellate court concluded that the realities of the impact of a state ethics commission proceeding necessitated a reliance on a heightened standard of proof and certified a question of great public importance to the state supreme court regarding the applicability of the clear and convincing standard, noting that the newly adopted burden of proof would impact a potentially large number of cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Circuit Court for Lake County (Florida) that denied his motion for post-conviction relief from his sentence of life in prison with a mandatory minimum term of 25 years, which was imposed for his conviction for attempted second-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, in accordance with Fla. Stat. chs. 784.07(3), 775.0825 (Supp. 1988).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding that a change in decisional law that invalidated the imposition of life sentences for the attempted murder of law enforcement officers pursuant to Fla. Stat. chs. 784.07(3), 775.0825 (Supp. 1988), merited retroactive effect, the court reversed the order that denied defendant's motion for post-conviction relief, and remanded. The court explained that the imposition of life sentences for attempted murder of law enforcement officers had been invalidated because it resulted in greater sentences for attempted murder of officers than for the actual murder of the officers. The court applied a three-part test to determine if that decision had retroactive effect. Because the decision came from the Florida Supreme Court and removed authority from the state to regulate certain conduct or to impose certain penalties, the first and third parts of the test were satisfied. The court found that because the penalty implicated the guarantees of due process and equal protection it was constitutional in nature, which satisfied the second part of the test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the denial of defendant's motion for post-conviction relief, and remanded for resentencing. The court held that a change in decisional law that barred the imposition of life sentences for attempted murder of law enforcement officers was entitled to retroactive effect because it issued from the highest court in the state, was of constitutional dimension, and limited the state's ability to impose a certain criminal penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an award of attorney fees to appellee landowner in eminent domain case that was calculated pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch.73.092 (Supp. 1994). That chapter provided that attorney fees should be based on a percentage of the benefit obtained after negotiations and defined benefit as the difference between final judgment and the last written settlement offer. The court rejected appellant county's argument that the statute was unconstitutional because the legislature had infringed on the powers of the judiciary to determine reasonable fees. The court held that when the legislature was silent on the factors it considered important in determining a reasonable fee, courts could look to the criteria enumerated in Fla. Bar R. 4-1.5, but where the legislature specifically set forth the criteria it deemed would result in a reasonable award, only the statutory factors may be considered. The court also rejected appellant's argument that the trial court erred in admitting a settlement offer into evidence in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 90.408 (Supp.1994) and held that the fee statute prevailed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because statute that authorized child's transfer to residential commitment facility was constitutionally valid, appellant child's delinquency adjudication was properly entered.

Stat. ch. 39.021(4) (1995). Appellant was charged with juvenile escape. The trial court adjudicated appellant delinquent for absconding, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 39.061 (1995). Appellant sought review, and claimed there was insufficient evidence to find the elements of lawful custody or escape, or that the facility from which he absconded was a residential commitment facility. Appellant also claimed the transfer statute was facially unconstitutional, because it was a delegation of legislative power to an agency, such delegation violated due process.

Stat. ch. 790.22(9)(a), the trial court was required to impose a five day detention period in addition to any other penalty permitted by law. Juvenile appealed, claiming the statute violated his rights of equal protection as it did not require the same for adults who were convicted of a crime. The court, in rejecting the argument, held that the juvenile offender and the adult offender were not similarly situated. With adult offenders, the state's primary objective was that of retributive punishment. One of the primary purposes of the Juvenile Justice Act, however, was to ensure the protection of society, by providing punishment and treatment consistent with the specific rehabilitation needs of the child. The court found the statutory classification was rational in light of the escalating numbers of firearms in the hands of juveniles, which the legislature could find posed more of a societal threat by virtue of the juvenile's immaturity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the trial court did not err in its determination that the statute imposing a mandatory five day detention period of any juvenile who committed an offense using a firearm did not violate the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, who each claimed injuries in an automobile accident, appealed from a jury verdict that awarded their past medical expenses only. The trial court refused to permit any questioning as to whether prospective jurors had preconceived attitudes, opinions, or beliefs concerning damage awards in general, and in particular, non-economic damages, and the court found that the trial court's limitation on the scope of plaintiffs' voir dire interfered with the right of their counsel to conduct a reasonable examination and prevented meaningful voir dire on damages. The court noted that a prospective juror's attitude about personal injury lawsuits was an appropriate subject for inquiry. The fact that the jury limited its award to economic damages established demonstrable prejudice as a result of the trial court's refusal to permit any inquiry of the prospective jurors' views on damages. Thus, the court reversed the judgment and remanded for a new trial because the trial court abused its discretion by prohibiting plaintiffs' counsel from asking the panel any questions about their views on damages, including non-economic damages.</SPAN></P>

The reason for the reassignment was that the present method of assignment was unacceptable to many of the judges. Petitioner court clerk sought a writ of prohibition against respondent. Petitioner contended that she had the power to fire deputy clerks and assign them to the position deemed most appropriate. Respondent contended that he acted under the authority of Fla. Stat. ch. 42.26 and Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.050(b)(6). Respondent contended that the plain meaning of the statute conferred upon him the power to assign clerks as he deemed appropriate to promote the efficient administration of justice in the courts. The court quashed respondent's order. The court held that the appropriate remedy was writ of certiorari as opposed to a writ of prohibition because prohibition was a preventative, rather than a corrective, remedy. It only acted to prevent the commission of the act, and was not an appropriate remedy to revoke an order already issued. The court concluded that respondent acted in excess of his jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 327.02(37) (1994), was unconstitutional on its face and Fla. Stat. ch. 327.10 (1993) unconstitutional as applied, appellee state sought review. The court held the trial court acted outside of its discretion in determining Fla. Stat. ch. 327.02(37) (1994) was unconstitutional. The trial court concerned itself unnecessarily with the possible constitutional infirmity of the statute's attempt to include the marginal sea and high seas within the jurisdictional purview of the state's regulatory authority. That concern was misplaced because the citation issued to the appellee was for a violation occurring well within the state's inter-coastal waters and well within the territorial limits of the state. It was a fundamental maxim of judicial restraint - ignored by the trial court below - courts were not to decide constitutional issues unnecessarily. The court held the purported selective enforcement of the statute was not unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. The mere failure to prosecute all offenders could not be a ground for a claim of equal protection denial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee filed a petition for rehearing and asked the appeals court to reconsider its decision of whether the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida) erred in denying appellant's motion for discharge under the &quot;speedy trial&quot; rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with second degree murder, attempted first degree murder, and shooting into a building. A not guilty plea was entered on May 4, 1992, and on that date the defense filed a demand for reciprocal discovery pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.220. The trial was set for May 26, 1992, without objection. Four days before trial, defense counsel requested a continuance on the ground that he had not received full discovery. The trial court granted the request, indicating that the delay would not be chargeable to the state. The trial was subsequently continued again and trial commenced in November, 207 days after appellant's arrest. On appeal, appellant contended that his speedy trial rights were violated. On rehearing, the appeals court withdrew its original opinion and held that the trial court did not err in denying appellant's motion for discharge under the speedy trial rule. The court reasoned that under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.191(j), since there were no allegations of state misconduct or other violation of defense discovery rights, appellant waived the 175-day speedy trial time by requesting a continuance. Thus, the court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not err in denying appellant's motion for discharge under the speedy trial rule, because appellant waived the 175-day speedy trial time by requesting a continuance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, an individual physician and several professional service corporations, filed a complaint for equitable relief and damages individually, and on behalf of the class of others similarly situated, asserting that a Public Medical Assistance Trust Fund was unconstitutional. Appellants opposed certification on the ground that appellees were not sufficiently similarly situated to the proposed class and that they had failed to first comply with Fla. Stat. ch. 215.26 by paying the assessment and then applying for a refund thereof. The lower court granted class certification. Appellants sought review claiming that appellees did not have standing to serve as class representatives because compliance with the refund procedure in chapter 215.26 was necessary before a civil action for a refund could be filed. The court found that compliance with the refund procedure was not required as a condition of bringing the instant action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff magazine corporation sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), which denied its motion for summary judgment and granted the cross-motion for summary judgment of defendant, thereby denying plaintiff's request for a tax refund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 212.05(1)(i) (1987), the state legislature imposed a sales tax on newspapers and magazines. However, beginning January 1, 1998, the legislature exempted newspapers from the tax. Upon review, the tax scheme was held unconstitutional. Therefore, on December 9, 1990, defendant state department of revenue began taxing both newspapers and magazines. Plaintiff magazine corporation sued claiming a refund of sales tax paid between January 1, 1988, and December 9, 1990. The trial court denied plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and granted final summary judgment to defendant. On appeal, the court found that the trial court correctly ruled that plaintiff was not entitled to a refund under the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Florida Constitutions. The court concluded that the sales tax paid by plaintiff could properly have been contested in a pre-deprivation proceeding pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 72.011 (1987). Accordingly, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order, which denied plaintiff magazine corporation's motion for summary judgment and granted final summary judgment to defendant department, was affirmed because there was no due process violation in the state's failing to provide a refund or other retroactive relief where plaintiff had an adequate pre-deprivation remedy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment from the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida) that convicted him of grand theft auto, ordered him to pay restitution without holding an evidentiary hearing pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.089(7) (1995), ordered him to pay his public defender's fees without holding a hearing, and sentenced him to jail followed by community control. Appellant claimed that the sentence and payment orders were erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of grand theft auto, and the trial court sentenced him to a jail term followed by community control, and ordered him to pay the fees of his public defender and to pay restitution to the victim including lost wages and travel expenses incurred when she testified at trial. On appeal, the court held that although Fla. Stat. ch. 775.089(1)(a) (1995) allowed the victim to be reimbursed for her lost wages and travel expenses, the trial court erred by not holding an evidentiary hearing pursuant to ch. 775.089(7) (1995) on the restitution amount. Because appellant did not object to his sentence at trial, he was precluded by ch. 924.051(3) (1996) from objecting to his sentence on appeal. Because ch. 924.051(3) (1996) was a procedural law, it did not violate the constitutional ex post facto clauses although it became effective after appellant committed his crime. Because the failure of the court to hold a hearing on the public defender's fees was a plain error, appellant did not need to object to it at trial. Therefore, the court reversed the judgment with respect to the payment orders, affirmed it in all other respects, and remanded the case for the proper hearings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment with respect to the orders to pay restitution and the public defender's fees, affirmed it in all other respects, and remanded the case for hearings on the restitution amount and public defender's fees, because appellant's failure to object to his sentence at trial precluded him from raising that issue on appeal, but the trial court could not order restitution or payment of public defender fees without a hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After several actions between the parties regarding statewide rates for waste and wastewater customers (customers), appellee public service commission (PSC) decided that it had jurisdiction over appellee utility company's facilities throughout the state.

The trial court ruled that PSC exceeded its statutory authority when it approved statewide rates without making the requisite findings of whether the facilities comprised a single system. Based on that ruling, the appellate court reversed the order setting the uniform rates. However, the appellate court held that PSC properly ordered the cost of appellant municipality's bulk wastewater rate because it was supported by competent, substantial evidence. PSC chose the rate from eight alternative rates and selected a fair and reasonable one. The trial court also properly granted PSC's motion to quash subpoenas duces tecum that were served on a large number of its staff. The prehearing officer had discretion to grant the order based on the probability that the requests were a fishing expedition. Orders were affirmed in part and reversed in part.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's grant of summary judgment to defendant widow in an action by plaintiffs, sons of decedent, who claimed that she tortiously interfered with their inheritance rights by causing decedent to reduce over time the amount they would inherit. Defendant was decedent's second wife, who was a beneficiary of decedent's will and revocable trust agreement. Plaintiffs could recover from defendant, because they could not have obtained the relief they were seeking by attacking the will in probate. Because the assets in the inter vivos trust into which the will poured over were not part of the probate estate, they were also not subject to administration. The trust was not incorporated by reference into the will, because the will did not clearly show an intent on the part of the testator to incorporate the trust.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation sought review of the trial court's order, which held that appellant's declaratory judgment complaint failed to state a cause of action.

The trial court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that such action by appellee was constitutional and that appellant's complaint failed to state a claim. In substituting the instant opinion for its prior decision, the appellate court reversed the trial court's order. The appellate court held that appellant was entitled to have a declaratory determination of the authority by which appellee charged the title search fee because both the validity of statutes and the validity of administrative regulations were proper subjects for declaratory decrees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a probation order of the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Indian River County (Florida), raising three issues concerning his judgment and conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted at trial, raised three issues on appeal. First, appellant argued that the trial court erred by increasing his sentence in violation of the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution. The court found no merit to this claim and affirmed the decision of the trial court. Secondly, appellant argued that the written conditions of probation requiring him to submit to random drug testing at his own expense were to be stricken as they were not orally imposed by the trial court at sentencing. The court agreed with appellant and remanded to the trial court in order to strike down the condition, which required appellant to pay for the drug testing. Likewise, the court determined that other special conditions of probation had to be orally pronounced at sentencing and were to be stricken as well for the court's failure to do so. Finally, appellant challenged the constitutionality of Fla. Sat. ch. 948.01(13)(a) (1993), contending that the drug offender probation statute constituted an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to an administrative agency. The court rejected this argument after reviewing applicable case law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision to increase appellant's sentence and to uphold the Florida drug offender probation statute as constitutional. The court reversed the trial court's order imposing special conditions upon appellant's probation because the conditions were required to be announced orally at sentencing and the trial court failed to do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tax payers sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, St. Lucie County (Florida) which dismissed appellants' complaint with prejudice regarding their action against appellee department of revenue challenging the constitutionality of the Florida Vehicle Impact Fee, Fla. Stat. ch. 320.072(1)(b) (1990).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tax payers sought review of an order by the trial court which dismissed with prejudice their complaint against appellee tax revenue department for failure to file a claim for refund as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 215.26(2) (1994). Appellants' complaint challenged the constitutionality of the Florida Vehicle Impact Fee, Fla. Stat. ch. 320.072(1)(b) (1990) and sought a refund for taxes paid. Appellants argued that the trial court erred in dismissing their complaint and the court upon review agreed. The court addressed a rule of the Florida Supreme Court which held that persons who paid the impact fee pursuant to a statute similar to ch. 320.072(1)(b) had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute and seek a refund for taxes paid. The state argued that appellants lacked standing for failure to comply with the one year filing requirements under ch. 215.26. Following the rule of the supreme court, the court determined that contrary to appellee's argument, appellants need not pay the fee or request a refund as the fact that they faced penalties for failure to pay an alleged unconstitutional tax was sufficient to create standing under state law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the order of the trial court which dismissed appellant taxpayers' claim with prejudice because the fact that appellants potentially faced penalties for failing to pay an allegedly unconstitutional tax was sufficient to create standing under state law and appellants were not required to file an application for refund with appellee tax revenue department to challenge the constitutionality of a tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of a decision from the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), which had dismissed lewdness charges against appellee suspects on the grounds that Fla. Stat. ch. 796.07(1)(b) (1991), which defined lewdness as any indecent or obscene act, was unconstitutional under the U.S. and Florida Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court reversed the dismissal order, finding that the lewd conduct at issue in the instant case was not expressive conduct protected by U.S. Const. amend. I. The appellate court further found that the determination that the sexual conduct in question was unprotected under U.S. Const. amend. I also compelled the conclusion that the Miller test regarding expressive material was inapplicable to the instant case, noting that Fla. Stat. ch. 796.07 regulated actual physical conduct. Accordingly, the appellate court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 769.07(1)(b) (1991) was constitutional on its face, rejecting the void for vagueness and overbreadth arguments because the narrowly drawn statute did give people of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what constituted forbidden conduct. The appellate court remanded for a reinstatement of the information against appellee suspects, finding that the lewdness charges did not violate appellees' right to privacy under the state constitution because they had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the conduct performed at a place where the public could patronize.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the dismissal of the lewdness charges against appellee suspects and remanded for reinstatement of the criminal information; the charging statute was facially constitutional, the expressive conduct at issue was not protected under the First Amendment, and appellees' privacy rights were not violated where they had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the conduct which formed the basis of the criminal charges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer. The jury returned a guilty verdict and a sentence was imposed which included probation and community control.

The written orders reflected that defendant had pled guilty and that the special conditions of community control were also conditions of probation. Defendant appealed. In reversing the sentence in part, the court ruled that the written orders required correction to reflect that defendant had been convicted after a jury trial. The special conditions of probation were required to be stricken because they were not orally pronounced. Moreover, Fla. Stat. ch. 948.01(13)(a), which defendant challenged, was held to not be an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to an administrative authority.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although petitioner former spouse had been released from confinement prior to the decision of the instant court, the court granted the petition for writ of habeas corpus, finding that the significance of the issues regarding the extent of its jurisdiction on habeas corpus relief in civil contempt proceedings, as well as the proper interpretation of the requirements to civil contempt incarceration, necessitated such a review. In support of his request for habeas relief, petitioner contended that his incarceration was illegal because he did not have the ability to pay the purge amount set by the issuing court. The court found that where there was neither an affirmative finding nor evidence in the record that petitioner, at the time of his incarceration for civil contempt, had the ability to pay the purge amount and thus to obtain his release from confinement, the incarceration was unlawful and petition for writ of habeas corpus was to be granted. The court concluded by certifying questions of great public importance to the state Supreme Court regarding the issues involved in imposing incarceration upon a finding of civil contempt in family support cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court granted the petition for writ of habeas corpus, holding that where petitioner former spouse was in civil contempt for his failure to pay child support, and the trial court had determined that incarceration was the appropriate method to coerce compliance, the setting of a purge amount without any finding that petitioner had the present ability to pay the purge amount constituted a violation of petitioner's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 440.02(1) (1994), which excluded mental injuries unrelated to compensable physical injury from workers' compensation coverage, did not comport with the requirements of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 12111 through 12117, Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). The court affirmed the lower court's denial of relief, holding that appellant failed to demonstrate her entitlement to the protection of the ADA, as she was not a &quot;qualified individual with a disability.&quot; Appellant also failed to demonstrate that ch. 440.02(1) conflicted with the ADA because state workers' compensation laws' goals differed from the ADA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged the order of the Circuit Court for Marion County (Florida), which dismissed the charges of statutory rape against appellee juvenile offenders, who engaged in consensual sex with two 12 year-old-girls, because Fla. Stat. ch. 800.04 (1993) unconstitutionally violated appellees' rights to privacy and equal protection under the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee juvenile offenders were two 15-year-old boys, who engaged in &quot;consensual&quot; sex with two 12-year-old girls. Although appellees were charged with violations of Fla. Stat. ch. 800.04 (1993), the girls were not charged. The trial court dismissed the charges and held that the statute was unconstitutional as applied appellees because the statute violated their right to privacy and equal protection under the law. Appellant state produced a record of numerous past referrals and adjudications to indicate why appellees were charged and the girls were not. The court held that whatever rights to privacy minors under 16 had, it did not include a right to engage in recreational sex with a minor also under the age of 16 because the costs and risks to society and the children involved were far too great. The court found that the crime was no less harmful than any other that may have been committed by a minor. The court vacated the dismissal of the trial court and remanded for further proceedings because appellant had a compelling interest in preventing such conduct and its consequences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner contended that the speedy trial rule of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.191 should have been applied to her indirect contempt proceeding. The county had declined criminal prosecution and the state had later filed an indirect criminal contempt action. The court granted petitioner's writ of prohibition against respondents, circuit court judge and others. The court overruled the previous case law that held that the speedy trial rule did not apply to indirect criminal contempt prosecution. The court found that certain legislative changes made the premises behind the previous case law outdated. The court also found that indirect criminal contempt was a criminal proceeding, and that pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.010, the rules applied to indirect criminal contempt. Finally, the court determined that the speedy trial time began to run from the time of petitioner's arrest and not with the subsequent service of a show cause order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of conviction of possession of cocaine, possession of cannabis, driving while license suspended, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Appellant contended the trial court's written sentence did not comport with the oral pronouncement. The appellate concluded that absent concession by the prosecution, a conflict between the written order and the oral pronouncement required a factual resolution by the trial court. Appellant argued the trial court erred by imposing standard conditions of probation provided in Fla. Stat. ch. 948.03(1), which were not orally pronounced at sentencing. The court concluded that certain conditions should have been orally pronounced and must be stricken. Appellant contended Fla. Stat. ch. 948.01(13)(a), establishing drug offender probation, was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to an administrative agency in violation of Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3.The appellate court held statutes were not unlawful delegations of legislative power when the power sought to be exercised was a technical issue of implementation and not a fundamental policy decision. The constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 948.01(13)(a) was upheld.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that Fla. Stat. ch. 827.071(2) and (3) did not violate appellee's right to privacy. The purpose of the statute was to protect minors from exploitation by anyone who induced them to appear in a sexual performance and showed that performance to other people.

He instituted an action against appellee municipality on behalf of himself and others similarly situated who had been fined by appellee for violations of the code but who had not been given the opportunity to contest them in a municipal court.

On appeal, the court determined that appellee had statutory authority to enforce its municipal code. Appellee was also permitted to adopt, by ordinance, a completely alternative code enforcement system to permit either a code enforcement board or an administrative hearing officer to conduct hearings and assess fines for code violations. The hearing's officers findings and imposition of fines and costs against appellant were not void and did not violate the separation of powers provisions of the state constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant sought review of an order from the Department of Management Services, Division of Retirement (Florida), which determined that appellant forfeited his right to receive benefits under the State of Florida Retirement System as a result of his plea of guilty to the charge of accepting a bribe in connection with his employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida Division of Retirement determined that appellant claimant forfeited his right to receive benefits under the state of Florida Retirement System (FRS) as a result of his plea of guilty in federal court to the charge of accepting a bribe in connection with his employment. On review, appellant argued that the forfeiture of his pension rights unconstitutionally retroactively took his vested property rights and violated the prohibitions in the state and federal constitutions against the impairment of contracts because he did not commit his crime until after his rights to his pension had vested. The court found no merit in appellant's arguments because, when he voluntarily elected to become a member of the FRS, the governing statutes contained the express provision that conviction for bribery in connection with one's employment resulted in forfeiture of pension rights. Therefore, the forfeiture provision was a part of the pension contract between appellant and appellee state, and to the extent that his rights vested after 10 years of service, they vested subject to this provision. Accordingly, the order, which denied appellant benefits, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order, which determined that appellant claimant forfeited his right to receive retirement benefits, was affirmed because there was no merit in appellant's arguments that such forfeiture was unconstitutional. The forfeiture provision was part of the pension contract when entered into and appellant's rights vested subject to that provision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county and appellee gas station owners challenged a non-final order from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), which assessed a $ 10,000 fine against appellees for violating a settlement agreement in an action to correct ground water pollution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action to correct ground water pollution, appellant county and appellee gas station owners mediated a settlement agreement in which appellees agreed to pay a fine of $ 10,000 if they complied with a plan to remedy pollution and $ 30,000 if they did not. Appellees did not comply with the plan, but the trial judge ordered appellees to pay only $ 10,000. The court reversed and found that there was no doubt that, by eliminating their exposure to far greater liability in the lawsuit, appellees received ample consideration for the settlement agreement and could not equitably be permitted to repudiate it. The court held that because there was no question of appellees' violation or the consequences, the payment of $ 30,000, which resulted from the breach, the trial court was required to enter judgment accordingly. The court directed the trial court to increase the amount that appellees were required to pay from $ 10,000 to $ 30,000.</SPAN></P>

The court directed the trial court to increase the amount of appellees' fine from $ 10,000 to $ 30,000.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father and widower appealed an order of the lower court awarding appellee grandmother, mother of his deceased spouse, visitation with his children, asserting that visitation was not shown to be in the best interests of the children. Appellee had filed a petition pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 752.01(1) (1993) for an order allowing her specified visitation with the grandchildren at appellee's home in New York. Appellant was willing to allow visitation at his home in Florida, but objected to visitation at appellee's home in New York because of his poor relationship with appellee. The visitation order was granted. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erroneously presumed that visitation between a grandparent and grandchild was in the children's best interests, shifting the burden to appellant to justify his decision against visitation with appellee. Appellee bore the burden of establishing by competent evidence that visitation with her was in the best interests of each of her grandchildren. The court reversed the order and remanded the case; the determination was unsupported by substantial, competent evidence that visitation was in each grandchild's best interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an insured employee, suffered injury in a workplace accident. Appellees, an insurer and employer, authorized chiropractic care. Upon appellees' request to deauthorize that care under Fla.

Appellant challenged that determination by arguing that ch. 440.13(2)(a) unconstitutionally violated his right of access to the courts under the Fla. Const. art.

The court found that appellant failed to assert or show that he had a common law right to chiropractic care prior to the adoption of the Florida Constitution and ruled that ch. 440.13(2)(a) did not restrict his right to proper treatment. Therefore, the court held that this statute did not eliminate a common law right of action. The court held that ch. 440.13(2)(a) did not deny due process because appellant was allowed a fair hearing. The court held that this statute did not deny equal protection of the law because it was rationally related to a legitimate state interest and did not create an improper classification.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee, a claimant for worker's compensation benefits, sought review of an order of the judge of compensation claims (Florida), which granted the request to exclude appellant's proferred medical expert's testimony under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.13(5)(e) (Supp. 1994) and then, in a formal order, denied appellant's petition for benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court rejected appellant employee's argument that the interpretation of the term &quot;authorized treating provider&quot; in Fla. Stat. ch. 440.13(5)(e) (Supp. 1994) to exclude his medical expert's testimony was error, finding that the term was properly interpreted as meaning treating providers authorized by appellee employer/servicing agent. The court then found that the statute's application did not cause a procedural due process violation, noting that although appellant was somewhat limited in the medical opinions he could have used, he had not been completely denied the right to present evidence. The court also found that the statute did not violate appellant's right of access to the courts because his cause of action, despite being restricted in the range of medical witnesses available to prove entitlement to worker's compensation benefits, had not been eliminated. The court affirmed, rejecting the contention that the statute was unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection guarantees because appellant failed to show that any classificatory scheme created by the statute could not have rationally advanced a legitimate governmental objective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of appellant employee's request for worker's compensation benefits following the refusal to allow the admission of appellant's medical witness' testimony; the challenged statute, although limiting in its effect on appellant's ability to use medical opinions to support his claim, was constitutional, given that it did not violate appellant's due process or equal protection rights or his right of access to the courts.</SPAN></P>

Under a portion of the statute there was an enhanced penalty for engaging in a high-speed chase with police. The lower court struck down this portion of the statute. On appeal by appellant state, the court held that appellee's vagueness challenge to the statute should have been examined in light of the specific facts of his case and not under standards applied to freedoms protected by the U.S. Const. amend. I. The court found that the statute, especially the contested portion, was not void for vagueness because appellee could reasonably understand that his contemplated conduct was proscribed. The court held that appellee failed to show that the statute was facially unconstitutional in that there existed no set of circumstances in which it could be constitutionally applied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought certiorari to quash orders of the Circuit Court for Brevard County (Florida) which allowed respondent criminal defendant to assert consent of victim minors as a defense to charges of lewd assault, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 800.04.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent criminal defendant was between sixteen and seventeen years old when he was charged with lewd assault involving some victims who were aged fifteen. Respondent raised consent of the victims as a defense. He moved to dismiss the charges, asserting that Fla. Stat. ch. 800.04, under which he was charged, was unconstitutional as applied to him because it precluded his raising as defense the consent of the victims. The trial court allowed respondent to assert the defense. The state petitioned, seeking certiorari to quash orders of the lower court. The court granted the writ and quashed the orders. The court held that the interest of the state in protecting children was more compelling than a minor's right to privacy. It ruled that the disallowance of consent of the victims as a defense did not render the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ of certiorari sought by the state to quash orders allowing respondent to assert consent as a defense to charges of lewd assault because the state's compelling interest in protecting children outweighed respondent's right to privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and his parents challenged a decision of the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida), which adjudicated appellant delinquent, committed appellant to high-risk juvenile detention, imposed immediate conditions regarding moral and spiritual training and media interviews, and ordered restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge adjudicated appellant delinquent, committed him to high-risk juvenile detention, imposed conditions regarding moral and spiritual training and media interviews, and ordered restitution. Appellant and his parents appealed the terms of the order. The court affirmed all the terms except restitution. The court held that the moral training program was valid under both the state and federal constitutions. However, it modified the condition by deleting the words &quot;and spiritual.&quot; The court held the ban on media interviews was valid as well because the condition bore a relationship to appellant's crimes. The court held that the court-imposed participation by appellant's mother was also valid because the trial court acted within the dispositional power expressly granted to it by the statute. The court reversed the order of restitution holding that since the hearing on the matter of restitution was held after appellant's notice of appeal was filed, the order imposing restitution was without effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the order imposing conditions regarding moral training and media interviews. The court deleted that part of the order regarding spiritual training however. The court reversed that part of the order regarding restitution and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
