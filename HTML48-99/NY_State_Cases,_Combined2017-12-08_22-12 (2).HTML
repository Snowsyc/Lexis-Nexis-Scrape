</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed motion to suppress all evidence acquired or derived from electronic surveillance in his prosecution for first degree criminal usury and grand larceny by extortion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first degree criminal usury and grand larceny by extortion. Defendant filed a motion to suppress all evidence acquired or derived from electronic surveillance that was authorized by court order. Defendant argued the electronic eavesdropping order exceeded the grounds of permissible state regulation as defined by the federal wiretapping laws. The court held a state could not broaden its powers in excess of the standards set forth in title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2510-2520. The crime with which defendant was charged was listed under state law as an offense that warranted investigation by wiretap, N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;700.05(8)(e), but was not listed as such an offense under federal law. However, the intent behind the federal statute was to target organized crime. As usury was usually accompanied by extortion, it thus fell within the catch-all phrase of the federal statute regarding other crimes dangerous to life or limb. Defendant's motion to suppress was denied as the state statute allowing eavesdropping in usury cases did not contravene or impermissibly expand the standards of the federal law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to suppress evidence acquired by electronic surveillance was denied because the state statute allowing electronic eavesdropping in usury cases did not improperly expand the standards of the federal wiretapping law regarding crimes warranting investigation by wiretap.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A motion by a defendant charged with criminal usury in the first degree and grand larceny by extortion to suppress all evidence acquired or derived from electronic surveillance pursuant to a court order is denied, since the warrant was not in derogation of the intent and objective of Congress in providing that a State could not broaden its powers in excess of the standards set forth in the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (see US Code, tit 18, &sect; 2516); the intention of the drafters of that legislation was to protect privacy of wire and oral communications unless the evidence emanating therefrom fell into a category of major offenses that were dangerous to life, limb or property or characteristic of the operations of organized crime, and although usury is a designated offense under the State statute ( CPL 700.05, subd 8, par [e]) and is not so specified under the Federal statute, pre-emption should not be applied as it was in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People v Shapiro</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (50 NY2d 747), since the affidavits supporting the application for the warrant made repeated references to organized crime and extortion is usury's necessary adjunct. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bank director brought a motion by way of an order to show cause requesting a preliminary injunction pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 6301, which restrained defendants, superintendent of banks, the banking board, and the banking department, from removing him from the board of directors of the bank.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The banking department issued a directive that stated that the director was ineligible for election as a board member because of the provisions of N.Y. Banking Law &sect; 397(2), para. b, cl. 3. The director was married to the niece of a member of the board of directors of the bank. The director contended that &sect; 397(2), para. b, cl. 3 was unconstitutional because it was arbitrary, irrational, and overbroad, and because it was an unreasonable exercise of the state's police powers, which violated the director's due process and equal protection rights. The court concluded that the director's rights to due process and equal protection of the law were violated and declared that the statute as it applied to the director was unconstitutional. The court explained that the statute significantly interfered with the exercise of the fundamental right to marry. The court determined that the goal sought to be achieved by the legislature was to eliminate nepotism and the eradication of such an evil could have been accomplished with a less restrictive statute. The court noted that the statute that was too narrow and had gone too far, to the point where the governmental interference became unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with failing to supply heat and hot water in his multifamily dwelling in violation of the city's housing code, Mount Vernon, N.Y., Housing Code art. 6, &sect; 4-1(a). Under &sect; 4-1(a), homeowners were obligated to furnish heat unless the failure to furnish heat was caused by circumstances beyond the owner's control or causation. The court found that the evidence established that there was no heat or hot water on the premises for two days and that it was then restored. The evidence further established that the disruption in the heat and hot water was caused by a break in a heat riser pipe as a result of freezing conditions. At the time the furnace was operable and there was adequate fuel oil. Therefore, defendant had no reason to anticipate that the pipe would break. Defendant tried to have plumbers fix the pipe and no one was available until the third day. The court found defendant was not guilty of the crime because the act, which originally deprived the premises of heat, was an involuntary act. The disruption in the heating system was not a result of any overt act or omission on defendant's part.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner licensee brought a proceeding, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, seeking review of a decision by respondent Board of Examiners of Nursing Home Administrators to revoke licensee's rights to operate a nursing home based on his misdemeanor conviction in New Jersey.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee was convicted in New Jersey of misdemeanor filing of false medical documents. The Board of Examiners in New York notified the licensee that his license to practice nursing home administration was forfeited by reason of the New Jersey conviction because the crime was a felony in New York. The licensee sought review, claiming that forfeiture without a hearing was unconstitutional and that the misdemeanor conviction did not invoke forfeiture. The court disagreed, holding that although the crime was a misdemeanor under New Jersey law, it was a felony in New York. Public Health Law called for forfeiture of a nursing home administration license upon conviction of a crime considered a felony in New York, even if it was a misdemeanor in the jurisdiction that conducted the trial. The offering of a false instrument for filing in the first degree was a felony in New York, which was the equivalent of the New Jersey statute under which the licensee was convicted. The forfeiture without a hearing did not violate due process and was not unconstitutional. The New Jersey order prohibiting consideration of the conviction in any civil proceeding had no extraterritorial effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that revocation of the license was constitutional and that the New Jersey conviction equated to a felony in New York.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since petitioner's New Jersey misdemeanor conviction for filing false and fraudulent nursing home claims for reimbursement under the Medicaid program constitutes a felony under the equivalent New York statute (Penal Law, &sect; 175.35), respondent may properly revoke petitioner's license to practice nursing home administration in New York by reason of the New Jersey conviction under a statute which calls for the automatic forfeiture of a nursing home administration license upon conviction of a crime which is a felony in New York although not in the jurisdiction where the licensee was convicted (Public Health Law, &sect; 2897, subd 2); revocation of a license based upon a felony conviction is constitutional and a license for the establishment of a nursing home may be revoked upon conviction of crimes involving matters relating to the operation of the home; the New Jersey order prohibiting the consideration of petitioner's conviction as evidence in any civil proceeding has no extraterritorial effect and, in any event, the automatic forfeiture provisions do not relate to any kind of civil&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  proceeding. </SPAN></P>

The wife remained concerned about the financial security of herself and three children stemming from her role as wife and mother. The husband opposed the wife's motion to discontinue her action, contending that it was merely a device to renew her action under the equitable distribution divorce law. The court held that the equitable distribution and distributive award aspects of the new law were to be applied retroactively. The effect of the entire domestic relations law was to make eligible for distribution property, which prior to the act could not have been subjected to such treatment. The statute was constitutional and did not constitute a deprivation of property without due process of law, in violation of the federal constitution and the New York Constitution.

Accordingly, the court denied plaintiff wife's application, made after defendant husband served responsive pleadings, to discontinue her action for divorce, where plaintiff was motivated by the possibility of financial gain, rather than by any possible reconciliation, and defendant, who wishes to amend his answer and interpose a counterclaim for divorce based on allegations of cruel and inhuman treatment, might be prejudiced if said discontinuance were granted, since, if he prevails on his counterclaim in the existing action, defendant will not have to pay plaintiff any alimony, but if plaintiff's action is discontinued and defendant reasserts his claim, alimony would be available to plaintiff, even if defendant prevails, under section&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  236 (part B, subd 6, par a) of the Domestic Relations Law, as recently amended, effective July 19, 1980.</SPAN></P>

Statutes are generally construed as prospective unless the language of the statute, either expressly or by necessary implication, requires that it be given a retroactive construction; remedial statutes constitute an exception to said general rule, but only to the extent that they do not impair vested rights. Accordingly, recently amended provisions of the Domestic Relations Law (L 1980, ch 281), which permit equitable distribution of marital property and distributive award, apply to actions commenced prior to the effective date of the statute, July 19, 1980, in which judgment was not entered and which are still pending, since said result is indicated expressly (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 236, part B, subd 5) and is, in any event, dictated in order to achieve equity; moreover, although said provisions make eligible for distribution property which, prior to the act, could not have been subjected to such treatment, the statute is constitutional and does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the United States Constitution or section 6 of article 1 of the New York State Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent was joined as a defendant in a proceeding in the trial court alleging negligence in the rendition of medical treatment. The alleged negligence took place in Queens and decedent was served with process in New York. Decedent passed away while the action was still pending. At that time, decedent was a domiciliary of North Carolina where his will was probated and his wife appointed executrix. The trial court ruled that the domiciliary fiduciary could not be substituted due to the North Carolina statute of limitations. The widow sought to have a New York ancillary fiduciary appointed. The court granted limited ancillary letters testamentary to the decedent's widow, holding that the liability policy was not the sole basis for jurisdiction. The court held that the acts complained of occurred in New York, and the decedent was both domiciled and served personally in New York State. The court held further that a less stringent test then the jurisdictional prerequisite of ancillary probate under N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc. Act Law &sect; 1602 applied and that the only property which could support the court's jurisdiction was the &quot;debt&quot; represented by decedent's liability insurance policy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were married in 1970. Almost five years later, the parties began to experience marital difficulties. In spite of the efforts of the wife to save the marriage, the husband became more distant, refused marriage counseling, stated he no longer loved her, absented himself from the home with increasing frequency, and ultimately moved out. In his counterclaim, the husband contended the wife's unwillingness to have children and to engage in sexual intercourse unless he used a contraceptive constituted a defense to her cause of action, and such cruel and inhuman treatment on her part warranted the granting to him of a decree of divorce. The court held the wife was entitled to a judgment of divorce because she demonstrated the husband engaged in a course of conduct constituting cruel and inhuman treatment of the wife to the extent that it endangered her physical and mental well-being and rendered it improper for her to cohabit with him. In addition, the court found the husband had not sustained his counterclaim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with robbery and grand larceny. At her court appearance, defendant pleaded guilty but challenged plaintiff prosecution's planned use of her prior felony conviction in that it related to a youthful offender crime and thus could not serve as a predicate for several reasons. The prosecution argued that in the absence of an unconditional discharge, she should have been sentenced as a second felony offender. The court held that the prosecution had met its burden of proving that such predicated felony conviction was constitutionally obtained and that a finding by the sentencing court that defendant would derive a benefit from probation had indeed been made under the Federal Youth Corrections Act (Act) 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 5010 (b). More importantly, the court noted that defendant was charged as a youthful offender under (d) of the Act, rather than state law, and that an offender was convicted until they were unconditionally discharged under that act. The court found that defendant's conviction under that act did not change the nature of defendant's admission to a felony and that her conviction still stood.

Participation in SEFAs was limited to two agencies. The charities petitioned to require the commissioner, comptroller, and private charities to permit them to participate in the SEFAs. The court noted that although &sect; 6-a granted the commissioner the authority to make rules and regulations governing contributions, no such rules or regulations concerning the procedures by which inclusion in a SEFA might be determined had been promulgated. In addition, private charities, which had the responsibility to determine inclusion in SEFAs, had no articulated procedure for selection. The court held that the participation of a charity in SEFAs should be determined on a rational and fair basis. The court ordered the commissioner to permit the conduct of only those SEFAs that were approved by him after promulgation of procedures articulating an objective standard for selection.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Accusatory instruments charging defendants with criminal nonsupport (Penal Law, &sect; 260.05), which merely repeat the language of the statute, are insufficient misdemeanor informations ( CPL 100.15, 100.40) since they fail to allege facts of any evidentiary nature to support the conclusory allegation that defendants willfully failed to provide child support although able to do so and neither the attached affidavits of the mothers involved nor reference to the Department of Social Services or Family Court support orders can cure the deficiency in the accusatory instrument; any statement by the People that the defendants have failed to obey Family Court support orders are extraneous and immaterial to a determination in criminal proceedings due to the nonfinal nature of such orders and any allegations concerning such orders should not be included in the accusatory instruments; however, the accusatory instruments are valid misdemeanor complaints since a misdemeanor complaint does not require every element of the offense to be actually set forth and, rather than ordering their dismissal as insufficient informations, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such instruments may be amended to satisfy the information requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Nonsupport of Child -- Double Jeopardy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Double jeopardy may act as a bar to a criminal prosecution when the purpose of a prior &quot;civil&quot; administrative proceeding was essentially punitive, thereby placing the defendant in potential jeopardy and, thus, the fact a support proceeding is in Family Court does not automatically exclude the viability of a double jeopardy claim in a criminal nonsupport prosecution (Penal Law, &sect; 260.05) since a support-related proceeding in which a person is entitled to assigned counsel to preserve his rights and is placed in potential deprivation of his liberty through a contempt hearing is not a proceeding that may automatically be regarded as &quot;civil&quot;; in resolving the issue of double jeopardy in a criminal nonsupport prosecution, the three areas to be examined are whether the charges in both cases arise out of &quot;identical transactions&quot;, whether the defendant was &quot;in jeopardy&quot; in the first support proceeding and whether the purpose of the first proceeding was punitive and, accordingly, since &quot;identical transactions&quot; are not involved, defendants' claims of double&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jeopardy in the criminal nonsupport prosecutions must be denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Nonsupport of Child -- Dismissal in Furtherance of Justice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Criminal court should not generally exercise jurisdiction over criminal nonsupport prosecutions (Penal Law, &sect; 260.05) since Family Court has exclusive jurisdiction over all support fixing and enforcement proceedings and only the Family Court can adequately investigate allegations of nonsupport and delve into matters determinative of needs of children, means and ability of parents to pay support and the adequacy of payments; based upon the extensive remedies in Family Court to enforce support orders including wage orders, sequestration of property and contempt sanctions (Family Ct Act, art 4), criminal sanctions for nonsupport have become an &quot;obsolete appendage&quot; to the Family Court system and extreme caution should be observed before resort is made to the criminal justice system; accordingly, since Family Court is equipped with a wide range of remedial resources and punitive sanctions and the State's interest in receiving support payments from those able to pay can be adequately safeguarded through the use of the Family Court system and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  since maintenance of criminal nonsupport prosecutions would deprive both the defendants and their &quot;victims&quot; of a more meaningful resolution of the nonsupport dilemma, the criminal prosecutions are dismissed in the furtherance of justice ( CPL 170.40).  </SPAN></P>

The supervisors claimed that the supervisor's findings were correct and the court did not have to reach the constitutional question raised by the incorporators.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was born in 1959. More than 10 years later, a paternity proceeding commenced. The proceeding concluded with the signing of a filiation order in 1969. The decedent died in 1977. The issue was whether the failure to initiate paternity proceedings within the statutory prescribed two-year period from birth pursuant to N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trust Law &sect; 4-1.2(a)(2) barred the child from inheriting from her father, notwithstanding the existence of a duly entered order of filiation declaring paternity. The court determined that the failure to institute paternity proceedings within two years of the child's birth did not deprive the child of her right to inherit. The court held that strict adherence to the two-year limitation offended the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and frustrated the original legislative intent to grant to illegitimate children rights of inheritance on a par of those enjoyed by legitimate children. The court found that the child was a person interested in decedent's estate within the meaning of N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former requirement of EPTL 4-1.2 (subd [a], par [2]) that in order for a child born out of wedlock to inherit from his father, filiation proceedings be initiated during the mother's pregnancy or within two years (now 10 years) of the birth of the child, is unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution; unlike the further requirement of EPTL 4-1.2 that such proceedings be initiated during the father's lifetime, the time limitation for commencement of the proceedings does not further the enunciated legislative purpose of the statute of establishing a valid procedural safeguard against false claims of heirship. Accordingly, petitioner, whose relationship to decedent has been established in a filiation proceeding brought during the lifetime of the father but more than 10 years after the petitioner's birth, is entitled to inherit from decedent, who died in 1977 when the two-year period applied, and to maintain a proceeding to compel an accounting as a person interested&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in decedent's estate within the meaning of SCPA 2205.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether confessions obtained in violation of Miranda of two murders for which defendant was never brought to trial could be considered by the court in a persistent felony offender proceeding under N.Y.

The court found that testimony at the trial was credible beyond a reasonable doubt and defendant's confession was truthful and voluntarily tendered, untainted by coercion, threats or pressure of any kind. Further, exclusion of the confessions would harm the sentencing process under the balancing test of the exclusionary rule. The court concluded that where there was no evidence that an invalid confession was obtained for the purpose of increasing a sentence and where the reliability of the confession was conclusively established according to legal standards, the confession was to be considered as evidence in a sentencing proceeding. Accordingly, the court held that the confessions were admissible and under the facts of the case, defendant was adjudged a persistent felony offender under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.10.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the grounds upon which defendant urged that the motion be granted was that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. Defendant's argument was that the term airpark was not defined in the town code and was not a word with a definite, ascertainable, and familiar meaning. What that suggests was that airpark was not a word with an accepted meaning long recognized in law and life. In granting the motion to dismiss, the court found that even considering the definition provided in the ordinance, there was some question as to whether &quot;a small airport&quot; was a definition of sufficient precision to give adequate prior warning. The court held that despite the strong presumption as to its validity, the ordinance was one, which failed to give a person of ordinary understanding prior warning of the conduct proscribed.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is a presumption in favor of the constitutionality of a legislative enactment, and a heavy burden of demonstrating unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt rests upon the one who claims it; the validity of a statute is to be determined solely with reference to constitutional restrictions, not by tests of natural equity or justice, and in determining the constitutionality of the statute, the court need not be absolutely certain as to the motive and intent of the Legislature.  The constitutionality will be upheld as long as there is some reasonable and possible basis for the legislation.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Consent of Imprisoned Father</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The loss of civil rights of an imprisoned parent provides a constitutionally valid ground for distinction from other parents in the denial of substantive rights; the State is entitled to determine that imprisoned parents should not arbitrarily withhold from their children the benefit of a stable family environment since it is the prerogative of the State to deprive an individual of certain rights to protect and preserve the rights of innocent citizens.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Termination of Parent Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The State may, when balancing the rights of a parent, whose own conduct has created a situation in which he is unable to provide a stable home for his child, against the interests of the child, reasonably choose to accord the parent's refusal to consent different weight than the refusal of parents not suffering the same disability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Cruel and Unusual Punishment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 160.50, defendant moved for the sealing of the record and return of his fingerprints and photographs after he had been granted an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal (ACD) with respect to charges of menacing and disorderly conduct, pursuant to an agreement with the prosecutor and as provided by N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In exchange for receiving the prosecutor's consent to an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal (ACD) on charges of menacing and disorderly conduct, defendant agreed to execute a waiver of various rights, including the sealing of the record and return of fingerprints and photographs, as allowed under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 160.50, and the right to bring a civil action against law enforcement officers connected with his arrest. A few months after the case was dismissed, defendant moved for the sealing of the record and return of his fingerprints and photographs. In denying the motion, the court noted that defendant had expressly waived his right to any such relief in the presence of and with the advice of counsel. The receipt of an ACD, the court ruled, was not a right, but was dependent upon the prosecutor's consent and the prosecutor could permissibly condition his consent on a waiver without violating defendant's rights or constituting prosecutorial vindictiveness. Such agreements between prosecutors and defendants were analogous to informed plea bargaining and were contractually binding on the parties since they were voluntary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion was denied because defendant had expressly waived his rights to such relief; making such a waiver a prerequisite to obtaining the prosecutor's required consent for an ACD was neither a violation of defendant's rights nor prosecutorial vindictiveness, especially since the agreement and waiver were the product of defendant's conscious, voluntary, and informed decision in the presence of and with the advice of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In determining whether a waiver of statutory rights made pursuant to an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal was coerced, hence invalid, the criterion is whether defendant had a choice of whether or not to accept the prosecutor's offer, and only in the most exceptional cases should a court conclude that the prosecutor's bargaining power so outweighed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant's so as to invalidate a waiver; although prosecutorial vindictiveness, the prosecution's vindictive increase in the severity of charges presented to a Grand Jury upon reindictment of a defendant who exercised a procedural right, may invalidate a defendant's waiver of a statutory or constitutional right, it does not pertain to plea bargaining where the prosecutor may bring a more serious charge against a defendant who reneged on his plea bargain. </SPAN></P>

The guardian commenced proceedings requiring the commissioner of social services to show cause why the court should not issue an order directing the commissioner to reinstate the mother's five person welfare budget, and provide supplemental money to cover food costs for her children's home visits. The court ordered the reinstatement of the shelter allowance to that for five persons and to provide supplemental moneys for food expenses during the home visits of the two children, holding that the two children were still considered domiciled with the mother although temporarily away.

Health Law &sect; 2164(9) relieved him of the obligation to obtain the required inoculations for his child. The court held that the parent was entitled to the &sect; 2164(9) exemption because he had shown the court the sincerity of his religious beliefs and established that there was nothing present that represented a clear and present danger of a particular communicable disease.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A motion for summary judgment was filed by defendant, the commissioner of the New York Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, in a proceeding brought by plaintiff village seeking a declaration that N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 41.34 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village challenged the commissioner's decision to locate a community residential facility for retarded adults within its limits, arguing that its zoning ordinances had been disregarded. Pursuant to N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 41.34, the commissioner held a hearing and thereafter rejected the village's objections. The village contended that &sect; 41.34 was an unconstitutional delegation of power to an administrative agency and denied it due process and equal protection. The court assumed, for the purposes of the commissioner's summary judgment motion, that the village had standing and that the matter was justiciable, and held that the village's claims lacked merit. Section 41.34 was a constitutional expression of the legislature's intent that mentally disabled persons receive care, treatment, and education in community settings when possible and furnished sufficient standards to guide the commissioner's discretion; it also provided for a hearing and judicial review of the commissioner's decision. To the extent that they conflicted with state law, the village's zoning ordinances were void.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An incorporated village lacks standing to bring an action seeking a declaration that section 41.34 of the Mental Hygiene Law, which relates to site selection of community residential facilities for mentally retarded and developmentally disabled persons, is an unconstitutional delegation of powers by the Legislature; such an action is not justiciable since it raises questions of broad legislative and administrative policy which are beyond the scope of judicial correction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A legislative enactment carries with it a strong presumption of constitutionality and is presumed to be supported by facts known to the Legislature, and this presumption can be overcome only by proof persuasive beyond a reasonable doubt; courts may not concern themselves with the wisdom or expediency of the legislation, nor may courts substitute their judgment for that of the Legislature, rather, it is only as a last resort that courts will strike down a legislative enactment on the ground that it is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Mental Health -- Community Residence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 41.34 of the Mental Hygiene Law, which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provides a mechanism for site selection of community residential facilities for mentally retarded and developmentally disabled persons, expresses the Legislature's intent to meet the needs of the mentally disabled by providing that such persons remain in normal community settings and receive whatever care, treatment, etc., as may be appropriate, defines a &quot;community residential facility for the disabled&quot;, sets forth procedures to air community objections and specifies factors to be considered by the commissioner of the office of the department responsible for the issuance of the license and operating certificate to such facility; therefore, said statute more than meets constitutionally accepted standards regarding legislative delegations of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Mental Health -- Community Residence -- Objections of Municipality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Section 41.34 of the Mental Hygiene Law, which gives a municipality the right to object to a State proposal concerning the location of a community residence facility, meets both the tests of due process and equal protection of the law where it provides for a hearing and judicial review of the decision of the commissioner responsible for selecting the location&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of such facilities, and where it is not even suggested that the statute is without rational basis or differentiates in a palpably arbitrary manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Local Laws -- Conflict with State Policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The police power of the State should not be limited by local objection and where a local ordinance conflicts with and hinders State public policy, the local ordinance is void since the test is that if the subject is a matter of substantial State concern, the Legislature may act even though there may be countervailing local concerns, and this is predicated upon broad principles of sovereignty which require that a State or one of its agencies be free of local control in performing a governmental function.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Vague statutes may offend the Constitution in three ways: (1) they may trap the innocent by failing to give a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly; (2) they may result in arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement in the absence of explicit guidelines for their application; or (3) they may inhibit constitutionally protected activity.  Impossible standards are not required and lack of precision is permissible as long as the prohibited practice is one commonly understood.  Accordingly, in a proceeding brought pursuant to section 384-b of the Social Services Law to transfer custody and guardianship of respondent's children to a public agency on the ground that respondent mother, by reason of her mental illness, is presently and for the foreseeable future unable to provide proper and adequate care for said children, the court rejected respondent mother's constitutional attack on the grounds of vagueness: the statutory requirement that parental inability to meet the child's essential needs must be affirmatively demonstrated negates respondent's notice&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  argument; the statute does not prohibit any constitutionally protected activity, although fundamental constitutional rights are involved; and, in the instant case, the court found that respondent is in fact mentally ill and will be for the remaining childhood of her children, thus defining the &quot;foreseeable future&quot; with sufficient definiteness on the facts; the parties stipulated to a dispositional hearing, thus avoiding the automatic and arbitrary granting of guardianship and custody to petitioner agency as required by the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Termination of Parental Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The strict scrutiny test of review applies to section 384-b of the Social Services Law, which provides for transfer of guardianship and custody of children to an authorized agency, permanently terminating the rights of parents whose consent to the adoption of the child would otherwise be required, but who are presently and for the foreseeable future unable, by reason of mental illness or mental retardation, to provide proper and adequate charge for a child who has been in the care of an authorized agency for the period of one year immediately prior to the initiation of the proceeding, by reason&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the statute's infringement on the fundamental rights of parents; the strict scrutiny test requires, in addition to the State's substantial interest in providing for the placement of foster children in a permanent stable home, that the statute be so narrowly drawn that there appears to be no other reasonable alternative for achieving the legitimate goal which has a less severe impact on the fundamental rights involved.  Accordingly, since section 384-b of the Social Services Law exceeds valid and necessary State interests, inasmuch as the time period in which the parent is unable to provide for the child, the &quot;foreseeable future&quot;, is the period in which the State has a valid interest in intervening and in which parental rights may validly be superseded, where respondent mother is unable to care for her children because of mental illness, a petition under section 384-b to commit guardianship and custody of her children to petitioner agency and to permanently terminate her parental rights is denied and foster care placement of the children is extended one year.  </SPAN></P>

After petitioner's direct appeal was decided, petitioner sought to vacate the judgment under N.Y. Crim. Proc.

The jury instructions stated that the law presumed that a person intended the natural consequences of the person's acts and that a person was presumed to intend the person's acts. The court denied petitioner's motion and held that petitioner was required, and had failed, to raise the issue on direct appeal. The denial of petitioner's motion was mandated by &sect; 440.10, because the jury instructions were on the record, the propriety of the instructions was reviewable on direct appeal, and petitioner failed to raise the issue on direct appeal. Petitioner's failure to raise the issue was not justified based on subsequent court rulings concerning the unconstitutionality of the instructions, because the issue was not previously raised and determined in petitioner's case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two children were abandoned by their presumptive father and their mother executed a surrender indicating her consent to adoption. When the county social services department sought to terminate parental rights, the alleged natural father claimed that N.Y. Soc. Serv.

The evidence indicated that the natural father had been involved with the children, but under &sect; 384 he was only entitled to present evidence concerning their best interests. The court found that the natural father was the parent of the two children and held that &sect; 384 violated the Equal Protection Clause to the extent that it permitted the adoption of out-of-wedlock children on the mother's consent alone. The rights accorded a natural father under &sect; 384 mirrored those contained in N.Y. Dom. Rel.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sections 384, 384-b and 384-c of the Social Services Law are unconstitutional, being violative of due process and equal protection, to the extent that they permit the adoption of an out-of-wedlock child upon the surrender of the mother alone and permit the termination of parental rights in a proceeding which significantly differentiates between the rights accorded an unwed mother and an unwed father and severely limit the ability of the unwed father to present evidence at such a proceeding, the unwed father being only entitled to notice of the proceeding and an opportunity to present evidence at the dispositional hearing with respect to the best interests of the child while the parental rights of the unwed mother can only be terminated upon proof of one of the statutorily enumerated grounds; the United States Supreme Court has invalidated section 111 (subd 1, par [c]) of the Domestic Relations Law which permitted the adoption of a child born out of wedlock without the consent of the natural father while requiring such consent from the mother (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Caban v Mohammed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 441 U.S. 380) and there is no significant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  difference between the rights which are terminated by an unwed mother who consents to an adoption pursuant to the invalidated statute and the rights which are terminated by an unwed mother who assigns to a social services agency her right to consent to an adoption, the result in each case being identical in that the child is freed for adoption without the consent of the unwed father; in the context of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Caban</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> holding, notice without opportunity to be heard on all relevant issues denies due process and renders such notice illusory.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landlord instituted a nonpayment action against respondent tenant to recover rent arrears.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landlord sought past due rent from respondent tenant, whose counterclaim asserted breach of the warranty of habitability and claimed damages for failure to make repairs. Respondent filed a motion for leave to proceed as a poor person and to request a jury trial. Petitioner asserted that the lease included a jury waiver clause, which continued in effect after the lease expired because respondent remained in possession as a month-to-month tenant under N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 232-c. She countered that the premises were subject to the rent stabilization law, while the petitioner cited cases decided under the rent control law. Further, she claimed that petitioner failed to offer her a renewal lease as required by law, although she had continued paying rent. The court agreed with petitioner that nothing in the rent stabilization law barred the projection of terms of a prior expired lease into the subsequent holdover tenancy, and that the jury waiver clause could be invoked against respondent. Her argument that the jury waiver clause was unduly broad and hence unenforceable was rejected. Her motion to proceed as a poor person was granted, but leave was denied for a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Summary Proceeding -- Waiver of Jury Trial in Expired Lease</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A month-to-month tenant who is the respondent in a summary proceeding is not entitled to a jury trial since the expired lease contained a jury trial waiver clause and the Conciliation and Appeals Board, in implementing the rent stabilization law, has treated month-to-month tenancies created by the landlord's failure to tender a lease renewal as creating a lease identical with the exception of increased rent to the one which expired, retroactive to the expiration date of the original lease; therefore, the terms and conditions of the expired lease survive when the tenant continues to pay the rent set forth in the expired lease and the jury waiver clause, freely agreed to by the tenant, is enforceable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Lease -- Waiver Clause in Expired Lease</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  A jury waiver clause in an expired lease, the provisions of which are continued due to the tenant's month-to-month tenancy is clear, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  legible and printed in accordance with the CPLR, and is therefore enforceable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Warranty of Habitability -- Waiver of Jury Trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  A jury waiver clause in a lease may be invoked regarding a tenant's counterclaim in a summary proceeding for breach of the warranty of habitability since section 235-b of the Real Property Law does not specifically prohibit the implementation of jury waiver provisions in trials involving warranty of habitability claims; although the statute prohibits waiver of the right to bring an action for breach of the warranty, it does not negate the fact that the warranty arises out of and by reason of the leasehold and the jury waiver is valid as against all claims arising out of the leasehold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Lease -- Jury Waiver Clause</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  A jury waiver clause in a lease, although very broad, and unenforceable against personal injury or property damage claims (Real Property Law, &sect; 259-c) is enforceable in a summary proceeding, since the all-inclusive element of the clause does not render it void in its entirety.  </SPAN></P>

The property owner filed a third-party action against the county under N.Y. Real Prop. Acts. Law &sect; 14, seeking redemption of the deed issued to the corporation. The property owner claimed title to the property as the sole survivor of his mother, who had acquired title to the property pursuant to the last will of her husband, the original owner. The property was at all times listed in the county assessment rolls in the name of the original owner. A public auction of the property was conducted due to unpaid taxes, pursuant to N.Y. Real Prop.

After further investigation revealed certain misrepresentations as to the &quot;long-term&quot; vacancy-requirement, the attorney general obtained an ex parte order of injunction under the Martin Act, enjoining the sellers from further sales of co-operative interest and transferring title or interest in the premises. The sellers sought to vacate the order, and the buyers sought leave to intervene.

Defendant claimed his constitutional rights were violated when the court admitted a statement he made during an illegal custodial interrogation, and the court improperly instructed the jury that a person is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act. Defendant claimed he was entitled to relief because changes in the relevant law operated retroactively. The motion was denied because the police acted within the limits of the law in effect when the appellate decision was made, and changes in the law did not operate retroactively. Further, the jury instruction was not improper because, when charge was considered as a whole, the jury could accept or reject the presumption.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Where a major purpose of a new constitutional doctrine is to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impairs its truth-finding function and so raises serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in the past, the doctrine has often been applied retroactively; however, with regard to the retroactivity of the exclusionary rule, judicial integrity is not offended if law enforcement officials reasonably believed in good faith that their conduct was in accord with the law even if subsequent decisions have held that conduct of the type engaged in by the law enforcement officials is not permitted by the Constitution.  Accordingly, where defendant claimed that at his trial testimony was admitted as to a statement allegedly made by him during a period of illegal custodial interrogation, and the Court of Appeals, in determining this issue adversely to the defendant, found that the police conduct in taking defendant into custody was within the prescribed limits of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People v Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (42 NY2d 129), which was the law at that time, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant may not have his conviction set aside on the ground that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Dunaway v New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (442 U.S. 200), which was decided after the Court of Appeals decision in defendant's appeal, and which reversed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> holding unconstitutional custodial interrogation with less than probable cause (except in certain circumstances), is retroactive; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Dunaway</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not retroactive, since its holding does not go to the fairness of a trial, and defendant is not entitled to the benefit of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Dunaway</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for at the time of the Court of Appeals decision it was not the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.02, and charged with possession as a felony rather than as a misdemeanor because of a prior conviction. Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment. The court held that &sect; 265.02 was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that since he had previously been convicted of any crime, to possess a weapon was a felony. The phrase &quot;any crime&quot; was clear and unambiguous and was not modified by any phrase. The phrase meant any crime and needed no judicial interpretation. In addition, the statute did not deny defendant equal protection. The New York Legislature could rationally conclude that a person who had been convicted of &quot;any crime&quot; should be prohibited from possessing a gun. Nor did the fact that the conviction of a crime raised the punishment violate equal protection. Lastly, since N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.10 provided defendant with a forum in which to challenge a prior conviction as unconstitutional before he obtained a firearm, the firearms prosecution did not open the predicate conviction to a new form of attack.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Due process prohibits the States from holding an individual criminally responsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed, and a statute is unconstitutionally vague if it fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by statute; the quest for definiteness does not preclude the Legislature from using ordinary terms to express ideas that find adequate interpretation in everyday usage and understanding, and a court may only consider a vagueness challenge on the facts of the case before it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for murder and robbery. A pretrial suppression hearing was held and the judge ruled that defendant's statement to the police at the time of his arrest was admissible. The day before the officer was to testify the United States Supreme Court rendered a decision on the admission of such statements. Defendant immediately renewed his motion to suppress on the grounds that his statement was the fruit of an unlawful arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At about 3:00 a.m. four officers went to the apartment where a codefendant had indicated defendant might be. When the person answering the door stated he was the person they were looking for, the officers arrested him. A detective then advised defendant of his rights, whereupon defendant explicitly waived all the rights and voluntarily made a brief exculpatory statement, denying any involvement in the murder. The state sought to offer the statement on rebuttal due to a material contradiction between defendant's statement and the testimony of two witnesses called by defendant, who did not testify in his own behalf. The court found that the police had probable cause to arrest defendant at approximately midnight when the codefendant pointed out the location of the apartment, and that the police had sufficient opportunity to obtain or attempt to obtain an arrest warrant between midnight and 3:00 a.m. It further found that a warrantless arrest was made in good faith reliance on New York law as it was on the date of the arrest. The court held that the time-of-search approach applied; thus the law of the new case did not apply and the admission of the statement was proper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In general, every case must be decided upon the decisional law that exists when the case is before the court, not necessarily as of the time of the events in controversy except for constitutional decisions which create new procedural safeguards for criminal defendants, overturning past law enforcement practices which had been permitted by prior decisional or statutory law such as the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Payton v New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (445 U.S. 573) which specifically superseded the law of New York by invalidating warrantless, nonexigent, nonconsensual entry into a defendant's residence to make an arrest ( CPL 140.15, subd 4); however, in such a search and seizure case, the time-of-search approach to retroactivity applies so that the benefits of new constitutional rules apply only to cases in which the constitutional event occurred after the new decision since, in any case involving the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, law enforcement officers who conform their conduct to the prevailing statutory or constitutional norm cannot be regarded as blameworthy, and, accordingly, since defendant's warrantless arrest&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at his residence based upon a codefendant's statements occurred prior to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Payton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case and was therefore valid when made, his subsequent statement is admissible and should not be suppressed as the &quot;fruits&quot; of an unlawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The prosecutor's offer of the statement made by defendant following his warrantless arrest at his residence only as rebuttal of defendant's case does not obviate the necessity of inquiry into its admissibility since defendant did not testify and the rule permitting impeachment use of suppressible evidence applies only where the defendant personally testifies in his own behalf; the rule enunciated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Payton v New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (445 U.S. 573), invalidating warrantless, nonexigent, nonconsensual entry into a defendant's home to make an arrest ( CPL 140.15, subd 4), would apply to the gunpoint seizure of a defendant on the threshold of his apartment in his doorway but such rule is inapplicable herein since defendant's arrest occurred prior to the date of the decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Payton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; however, if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Payton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been applicable, the admissibility of defendant's statement would be doubtful since the People failed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in their burden of justifying the warrantless home arrest in view of the intentional three-hour delay in arresting defendant during which time various officers were available to seek an arrest warrant. </SPAN></P>

Thus, it was reasonable to combine both in the category of &quot;others similarly situated.&quot; Defendants failed to carry their burden of proof. Defendants failed to show conscious, intentional discrimination on the part of the government. Therefore, the motion to dismiss was premature. Defendants' motion for an evidentiary hearing was premature because there was no evidence of a reasonable probability of success on the merits. Discrimination was not a valid defense. Therefore, the court treated the discovery motion as a motion for dismissal or to quash. Defendants' motion for discovery failed because statistics were not discoverable under N.Y. Crim. Proc.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In order to establish that a law, valid on its face, is unconstitutionally enforced in a discriminatory manner, one must show not only that the law is selectively enforced, but also that the selective enforcement is deliberately based upon an impermissible standard, which discriminatory intent may be proved by a convincing showing of a grossly disproportionate incidence of nonenforcement against others similarly situated; if a defendant can establish that conscious, intentional discrimination exists in the enforcement of the criminal statute under which he or she is charged, then the defendant is entitled to a dismissal of the prosecution as a matter of law, but the defendant's burden of proof is heavy, partly because there is a presumption that the enforcement of the laws is undertaken in good faith and also because the authorities must be allowed latitude in making law enforcement decisions.  Accordingly, although it is reasonable to combine the prostitute and the patron in the category of &quot;similarly situated&quot; persons, the court denied, as premature, defendants' motion for an order dismissing the accusatory instruments&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  against them charging prostitution where they did not present sufficient evidence to prove their claim that the District Attorney or the city police consciously, intentionally discriminate in enforcing the law proscribing prostitution offenses (Penal Law, art 230) by routinely enforcing section 230.00 of the Penal Law against female prostitutes while they do not enforce section 230.03 against their male patrons.</SPAN></P>

Defendants contended that New York courts lacked jurisdiction over Mohawk Indians, that the charges against them were the result of selective prosecution, and that the charges were not supported by sufficient evidence.

The court also held that the Treaty with the Seven Nations of Canada, 1796, not the Canandaigua Treaty of 1794, was the determinative of defendants' rights as residents of the St. Regis Reservation. According to the court, the St. Regis Reservation was not a sovereign territory of the Mohawk nation because the Mohawks physically abandoned New York. The court also held that the court followed the correct dispute resolution procedure.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendants were indicated for criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, they moved for discovery of the district attorney's charge to the grand jury and dismissal of the indictment, alleging that the grand jury was improperly charged regarding the presumption of possession of a weapon in an automobile. In dismissing the indictment, the court concluded that the district attorney improperly instructed the grand jury. The failure to instruct the grand jury concerning the permissible nature of the presumption arising from the presence of a weapon in an automobile to possession by all occupants could very likely have led the grand jury to infer that the presumption was mandatory, thus prejudicing the defendants. The specific charge given was insufficient and misleading and was used to supply the necessary element of possession. The improper charge constituted a defect impairing the integrity of the grand jury proceeding and requiring dismissal.</SPAN></P>

After a historical review of the sources of &sect; 176, the court stated that &sect; 176 did not have any significance and to interpret it otherwise, as the husband desired, would ignore its legislative purpose as manifested by the record of the past.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the motion because it found that the senior citizens failed to meet the heavy burden of demonstrating that the zoning limitations were unconstitutional on their face. The subject limitations were enacted pursuant to Clarkstown, N. Y., Town Law &sect; 261 that permitted the town to impose zoning regulations for the purpose of promoting the general welfare of the community. The ordinances prohibited the construction of more than 106 dwelling units at any one senior citizen housing site, and prohibited construction of such sites within 1,500 feet of each other. The parties disagreed as to their effect. The senior citizens contended that there were few sites in the town, which would qualify for senior citizen housing, thereby discriminating against senior citizens.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States Constitution does not require that all persons be treated identically, but it does require that differences in treatment of persons similarly situated be justified by an appropriate State interest, based on whether the classification has a rational relationship to a legitimate State objective; moreover, an exceedingly strong presumption of constitutionality applies not only to enactments of the Legislature, but to ordinances of municipalities as well and, while this presumption is rebuttable, unconstitutionality must be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt and only as a last resort should courts strike down legislation on the ground of unconstitutionality. Accordingly, plaintiff failed to meet its heavy burden of demonstrating that town zoning limitations which prohibit the construction of more than 106 dwelling units at any one senior citizens' housing site and prohibit construction of such sites within 1,500 feet of each other are unconstitutional on their face, since the limitations would appear to have a rational basis when viewed as part of the comprehensive plan the town asserts it has formed in order to integrate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  senior citizens into the community by providing for &quot;optimum sized&quot; housing throughout the town; it does not appear as irrational and discriminatory that no such restrictions are imposed upon other dwellings erected in multiple residence zones in the town because the remainder of these buildings are erected without regard to considerations of the age of the occupants and will, therefore, be available for the utilization of the entire population, including senior citizens. </SPAN></P>

The court held that this construction of the state constitution prevented a court from substituting its judgment for that of the legislature in welfare matters; that the writ of any New York court could not be made to run that far.

According to the court, the corporation was not technically &quot;prosecuted&quot; for the previous offense because the previous prosecution was before the New York Administrative Adjudications Bureau (AAB) and the AAB was not a court. However, the court held that the action against the corporation was barred because the advantage of being subjected to a civil proceeding in the AAB did not justify denying the corporation the protections afforded by the N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 40.20(2).</SPAN></P>

The state opposed the motions as untimely, and claimants argued that their causes of action arose after the appellate court decision. The court found that a claim for a tax refund accrued upon payment of the tax and that claimants' argument that they had no a forum within which to bring their causes of action was without merit. The court discussed several avenues of recourse that were open to claimants at the time they paid the taxes and concluded that the claims arose when they paid the taxes, so the claims expired prior to the enactment of &sect; 10(6), and therefore, the series of motions were untimely.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the resolution of the town board setting forth the term of legal counsel's employment clearly did not spell out the relationship of attorneys to the town but, on the contrary, appointed the office of town attorney.

The court held that the agency did not meet its burden of showing grounds for the termination of the parents' rights. The court found that the agency did not show grounds for abandonment or permanent neglect. The court noted that consent to adoption by the older child, who was 14, was required under N.Y. Dom. Rel.

As to the younger child, the court ruled that termination of parental rights under N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 384-b(4)(c), which stated grounds as mental illness or retardation of the parents, would be unconstitutional.

The drastic disparity of treatment between mentally ill or retarded parents whose rights are immediately terminated by such a finding and their consent to any future adoption dispensed with and neglectful or abusing parents who are entitled to a hearing on the issue of the child's best interests before termination is improper; it violates substantive due process by providing for termination of the mentally ill or retarded parent's rights without fault and violates the equal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  protection clause by applying a separate and distinct standard to the mentally ill or retarded. </SPAN></P>

The City of New York contended that the employees had no standing to sue because they were members of a union and that the union should have been the party litigating the issue. The court determined that an employee could maintain an action against his employer because the arbitrator's determination extending the deferral of wages for city employees took place during the period of time when the employees were state employees. The court held state employees were not affected by city legislation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayers filed a protest of a tax assessment on certain real property by respondent town for certain years.

The court denied all of the motions made during the trial on which the court reserved decision and held that the taxpayers' proof fell far short of what was required for the court to accept the bare fact of what the state rate was for the years under review as being of any probative value on the issue of inequality. The court also found that the subject statutes were unconstitutional because they permitted one class of taxpayer to rely on evidence of ratio while prohibiting all others from using the same method of proof. Although the defect took on added dimensions when the statute was also to be applied retroactively to litigants who had a constitutionally vested right to a refund of excess tax payments, the statutes were inapplicable to the proceeding. Therefore, the court reasoned that because of the taxpayers' failure to prove ratio and inequality, the court had to dismiss the petitions.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that by the enactment of &sect; 307, the legislature had delegated to administrative officials the power to determine how great a tax burden was placed on a particular piece of property. The court reasoned that the real property tax was largely determined by the classification of property adopted by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment. However, the court stated that the agency was given absolutely no standards or guidelines to limit its discretion in classifying property. The court further held that &sect; 307(3) was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power because it in effect gave the assessors unlimited discretion to select the rate at which property would have been assessed, and this was an impermissible delegation of the legislative power.

Defendant filed a motion for removal and contended that the district attorney's ability to block removal pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc.

The court reasoned that the statute did not constitute an encroachment on separation of powers, because the district attorney was not vested with a judicial function or with a vehicle for trespassing on judicial turf. The removal was inappropriate, because a private trial was not a proper forum for the adjudication of a crime of such proportions.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A statute which vests the prosecutor with the power to grant or withhold consent to remove certain juvenile offender cases to the Family Court ( CPL 210.43) poses no direct or potential threat to the judicial functions under the statute, and is, therefore, not violative of the doctrine of separation of powers; the Legislature, by requiring the prosecutor's preliminary removal consent when certain highly serious designated crimes are charged, has not invested the prosecutor with a judicial function or with a vehicle for trespassing on judicial turf since, if and when a prosecutor does consent, the court must itself, in the interests of justice, and under articulated standards, decide whether removal to the Family Court would be appropriate; by granting the court and the prosecutor the authority to concur in or to reject the defendant's proposed removal, the prosecutorial consent is no different from the &quot;veto power&quot; which resides in the prosecution when it chooses to withhold consent to a lesser plea; the statutory scheme is not irrational since it is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  well within the power of the Legislature to insist on superior court trials in cases of serious crimes committed by juvenile offenders and to provide its prosecutorial arm with the means to carry out that objective.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although a superior court has no statutory authority to remove certain serious charges against a juvenile offender to the Family Court over prosecutorial objection ( CPL 210.43, subd 1, par [b]), since there is language in a decision of the Court of Appeals suggesting that the judicial power to dismiss in the interests of justice may be read to include the power to remove a juvenile crime in the interests of justice over prosecutorial objection (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Vega v Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 47 NY2d 543), the court will make an &quot;inquiry&quot; ( CPL 210.43, subd 3) for the purpose of determining whether murder and sodomy charges against defendant should be removed to the Family Court in the interests of justice based upon the documentation submitted by both sides, a formal hearing not being required; accordingly, based upon consideration of the factors bearing on the issue of removal ( CPL 210.43, subd 2, pars [a]-[h]), &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  removal in defendant's case is not warranted since the proof is sufficient for indictment, no mitigating circumstances exist and defendant was not merely a minor participant; furthermore, considering the severity of the crimes charged, the sodomization and murder of a young boy, community safety, welfare and confidence in its legal system overwhelmingly dictate that the State not be compelled to forego a full scale criminal prosecution, with the outcome and result commensurate with legislative and community standards.  </SPAN></P>

With regard to state's summary judgment motion, the business owner argued that the Education Law prohibited the rendering of assistance for hire, and his products were not &quot;assistance&quot; but rather publications entitled to First Amendment protection. Upon review, the court held that the business owner's arguments were specious and that there was no genuine issue of material fact to preclude the entry of summary judgment.

The court held that the state was entitled to a permanent injunction and that the business owner had grossly flouted the terms of the preliminary injunction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners brought an action against defendants, adjacent landowners, nonprofit corporation, and others, to permanently enjoin the threatened use by the corporation of the easement over the property owners' driveway for other than its intended use as a means of egress and ingress. The property owners argued, inter alia, that use of the adjacent residence for the mentally disabled violated the terms of the easement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners argued that the use of the adjacent residence as a facility for mentally disabled adults violated the terms of the easement and violated the property owners' constitutional rights. The property owners also argued that the Padavan Law, N.Y. Mental Hyg. &sect; 41.34 was unconstitutional as applied. The adjacent landowners, the nonprofit corporation, and others filed motions to dismiss the property owners' complaint and for summary judgment. The court held that: (1) the property owners' the complaint failed to state a cause of action against the adjacent landowners who conveyed the property to the nonprofit corporation; (2) the nonprofit corporation's proposed use did not violate the easement because there were no words of restriction in the easement other than that it was to be used for egress and ingress; and (3) the Padavan Law was constitutional because the law was an act of general legislation and therefore required neither notice nor a public hearing to effect the desired change. The court concluded that the property owners' action had to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An action by owners of a servient estate seeking damages and an injunction for alleged violations of an easement is dismissed against the previous owners of the dominant estate since they cannot be enjoined from passing title where they have already done so, and since they made no representations or warranties regarding the easement of which plaintiffs were the beneficiaries; in addition, plaintiffs' cause of action against the mortagee of the dominant estate, who consented to defendant community residential facility's assumption of the mortgage held by the prior owners of the dominant estate, for violation of a mortgage covenant restricting use of the mortgaged premises to a one- or two-family dwelling, is dismissed since plaintiffs have failed to show that they were a party to said mortgage or that they or their grantors were intended to be benefited by the restriction therein; unless a mortgage provides otherwise, covenants in a mortgage bind the heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of the mortgagor, and inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of the mortgagee&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and there is nothing in the mortgage that expressly provides for any benefit to plaintiffs or their predecessors in title.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In determining whether a community residential facility's use of an easement, previously used by a single-family residence, violates and overburdens the easement, the language of the easement is controlling, and where the easement provides only for &quot;egress and ingress&quot; with no other words of restriction, the dominant estate is entitled to use the easement for egress and ingress as is necessary; a reference in the easement to the right of the occupants of the dominant estate to erect two name signs does not evidence an intention to restrict the dominant estate to one- or two-family use; furthermore, a change in the use of the dominant estate does not, in the absence of any qualifications, change the use of the easement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Mental Health -- Licensing of Community Residential Facilities -- Reasonableness of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Section 41.34 of the Mental Hygiene Law, which provides a procedure for establishing and licensing community residential facilities for the mentally disabled, is not an unreasonable exercise of the State's police power simply because the statute may have a detrimental effect on plaintiffs in that the property proposed for a residential facility has the benefit of an easement over plaintiffs' property; the statute meets the test&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of reasonableness since there is no encroachment on the exercise of private rights without substantial relation to a legitimate governmental purpose; in addition, the appropriate sites for residential facilities are to be determined by the Commissioner of the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities and not the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Mental Health -- Licensing of Community Residential Facilities -- Local Zoning Ordinances</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Article 7 of the Village Law, which provides that local zoning ordinances, once enacted, may not be changed or amended by the municipality without complying with the prescribed notice and hearing requirements, is not applicable to section 41.34 of the Mental Hygiene Law which provided that community residential facilities shall be deemed family units, since section 41.34 is enacted by the State Legislature.  </SPAN></P>

The court reporter's association brought an action to contest the directive and argued that all court reporter II employee's were peace officials under N.Y. Crim. Proc.

The court rendered judgment in favor of the court reporter's association and found that although &sect; 1.20(33)(b) was ambiguous, the statute had long been interpreted to include court reporter II employee within the definition of peace officer. Respondents' directive was an illegal attempt to legislate under the guise of interpretation of the statute. The court also found that the directive violated the affected employees equal protection rights because the directive did not apply to court clerks and law clerks who were similarly situated with respect to peacekeeping functions and the carrying of firearms. Finally, the court found that the directive was an improper attempt to regulate the off-premises, off-duty conduct of reporters in a manner unrelated to their employment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Court reporters are officials of the court and, therefore, peace officers pursuant to CPL 1.20 (subd 33, par [b]) who are entitled to carry firearms; CPL 1.20 (subd 33) is a vague and ambiguous statute which may not be construed by administrative directive to operate to the detriment of the court reporters, who may be liable for criminal prosecution pursuant to the administrative interpretation of the statute, a result that is shocking to the judicial conscience; the interpretation of CPL 1.20 (subd 33, par [b]) by administrative directive to prohibit the carrying of firearms by court reporters is unlawful, arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Court reporters, who are similarly situated to law clerks, are equally involved with peacekeeping duties and disparate treatment with respect to the right to carry firearms as peace officers ( CPL 1.20, subd 33, par [b]) is discriminatory and has no rational basis; therefore, the administrative directive prohibiting court reporters from carrying firearms violates the equal protection clause of the New&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  York State Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as there is no rational relationship between the distinction drawn between the two classes of employees and the objective of the regulation, public safety.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An administrative directive prohibiting court reporters, who are peace officers pursuant to CPL 1.20 (subd 33, par [b]), from carrying firearms exceeds the scope of lawful governmental purpose and is arbitrary, unreasonable and an abuse of discretion since it does not merely regulate but imposes a blanket prohibition against the use and possession of firearms by court reporters while off duty and off premises; a directive must have a reasonable connection with employment.  </SPAN></P>

The appellate court vacated the default and ordered a new trial because the trial court terminated her rights based on a &quot;best interests&quot; test and not on N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 384-b. The case was remanded for fact finding through the trial court's observations of the witnesses and the parties. In the new trial, the agency's petition was dismissed, and the court held that the agency failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the parent failed to plan for the future of her child despite diligent efforts of the agency to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A child welfare agency which has placed a child in foster care due to the parent's inability to care for the child has an obligation, pursuant to section 384-b (subd 7, pars [a], [f]) of the Social Services Law, to make diligent efforts to assist in the formulation of viable proposals to develop a reasonable plan for the child's future and to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship with the child unless it were to prove detrimental to the child's best interests since the parent is severely disadvantaged, being burdened with economic, emotional, mental and physical problems and the agency has expertise experience, capital and manpower, and efforts correlative to its superiority are obligatory; therefore, the agency having failed to inform the parent of her responsibility to plan for the future of her child or to assist her in developing a plan for the child's future, the agency failed in its duty to the parent and child, the parent's rights to her child may not be terminated due to her failure to plan for the future of her child&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (Social Services Law, &sect; 384-b, subd 7, par [a]).</SPAN></P>

There is particular importance in child custody, visitation or neglect proceedings that factual findings be made by the trial court which has the best ability to measure the credibility of witnesses.  The court was deprived in this child neglect proceeding of the opportunity to determine credibility through observing the demeanor of witnesses giving testimony by the failure of both the child welfare agency and the mother of the infant to testify before the court, and instead submitting a case record and a transcript from a previous hearing, thereby denying the court the opportunity to consider the appearance, attitude and demeanor of witnesses in testing veracity and determining the weight to be accorded their testimony.  </SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the informations and held that the legislature of the county did not merely incorporate the rules or standards of a private association. The county provided that the provisions of the National Fire Protection Association (association) rules and standards, as amended, were deemed part of the ordinance. By enacting the association's amendments, prior to their adoption, the county delegated to the association sovereign and legislative power. The county relinquished all control over the ordinance pertaining to flammable and combustible liquids to the association, which was an improper delegation of legislative authority, and, therefore, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner argued that N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect;&sect; 111 and 111-a were unconstitutional. The court held that no notice of an adoption proceeding was required to be given to a putative father who did not qualify under any of the provisions of &sect; 111-a. Further, the court held that since &sect; 111-a did not require any notice to be given of the adoption proceeding, the mother or the adoptive father's knowledge of petitioner's claim to the parentage of the child was irrelevant and without legal significance. That being the case, neither the mother nor the adoptive father could have been charged with committing any fraud upon the court for failing to do that which the law clearly did not require them to do. Because New York had a legitimate state interest in enacting &sect; 111-a and in establishing a putative father registry, the court held that it found no constitutional infirmity in the statute. The court denied petitioner's application to be permitted access to the records of the adoption.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The court in an adoption proceeding involving an out-of-wedlock child is under no obligation to exercise its discretion (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 111, subd 3) and require that the petitioning adoptive parent give notice of the proceeding to a putative father who does not fall within any of the seven categories of putative fathers entitled to notice of an adoption proceeding (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 111-a) and whose consent to the adoption was not legally required (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 111, subd 1, par [c]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Notice to Putative Father -- Information Concerning Mother's Relationship with Putative Father</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since no notice of an adoption proceeding involving an out-of-wedlock child is required to be given to a putative father who does not fall within any of the seven categories of putative fathers entitled to notice of an adoption proceeding (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 111-a), the fact that the natural mother and her husband, the adoptive father, knew that such putative father had instituted a paternity proceeding prior to the signing of the adoption order is irrelevant, without legal significance and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  insufficient to vacate a consummated adoption; since the adoptive father, the only real party in interest, is in no way bound by any adjudication that might be made in the putative father's paternity proceeding, he cannot be charged with the legal consequences of knowledge, actual or imputed, of the putative father's asserted claim to fatherhood; neither the mother nor the adoptive father can be charged with committing any fraud upon the court for failing to do that which the law clearly did not require them to do and since information concerning the full extent of the relationship between the mother and the putative father is irrelevant to the decision to approve the adoption as being in the best interests of the child, the mother's failure to disclose such information to the court does not constitute a fraud sufficient to warrant vacating and setting aside the adoption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Adoption of Child Born out of Wedlock -- Investigation of Relationship between Mother and Putative Father</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The court is not obligated to require an investigation into the social history of the natural mother and the putative father before approving the adoption of the mother's out-of-wedlock&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  child by her husband since the areas the preadoption investigation are required to cover only concern the adoptive parents and the adoptive child (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 116, subd 3) and, even if certain information concerning the mother's mental and emotional instability were revealed by a thorough and in-depth investigation into the illicit relationship between the mother and the putative father, such information, no matter how derogatory, could not in any way be significant or relevant to the court's decision to approve or disapprove the stepfather's application for the adoption of the child, the character and fitness of the adoptive parent being the primary concern in the proceeding and the only role of the child's mother being to grant her consent to the adoption (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 111, subd 1, par [c]).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Section 111 of the Domestic Relations Law, insofar as it requires the consent of only the mother of an out-of-wedlock child to its adoption, is unconstitutional (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Caban v Mohammed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 441 U.S. 380).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The fact that section 111-a of the Domestic Relations Law requires that notice of an adoption proceeding involving an out-of-wedlock child be given to seven enumerated categories of putative fathers, but does not require that notice of the proceeding be given to all putative fathers, does not deny due process and equal protection of the laws to those putative fathers not covered by the statute since the statute's classification of putative fathers is rational and reasonable and not palpably arbitrary in that the purpose of the statute is to dispel uncertainies by providing clear constitutional statutory guidelines for notice to putative fathers, establish finality in adoption proceedings, provide an expeditious method for child placement agencies to ascertain those fathers who are entitled to notice and afford concerned fathers of out-of-wedlock children a simple means of expressing their interest and protecting their rights to notice and an opportunity to be heard; in any event, there is no need to pass on the constitutionality of the statute since the putative father would not benefit from a finding of unconstitutionality in this case, he does not fall within&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any of the classifications of putative fathers who are affected by the statute and thus lacks standing to attack the statute vicariously by asserting grounds not personal to him and, finally, a court of first instance should not declare a statute unconstitutional except in rare cases involving life and liberty and where the invalidity of act is apparent on its face.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant corporation was charged with having violated a building zone ordinance, Brookhaven, N.Y., Code &sect; 85-23(A), (B), in that it permitted the premises to be used for a nonpermitted use by operating a real estate business in a residential district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation admitted during trial that it operated a real estate business. The corporation argued that the ordinance did not state that the operation of a real estate agency was prohibited. The court concluded that the ordinance failed the void for vagueness test because the corporation was not given sufficient notice that its conduct was prohibited by the ordinance. The court explained that the factual part of the information alleged that the corporation permitted the premises to be used for a non-permitted use, but nowhere in Brookhaven, N.Y., Code &sect;&sect; 85-23, 85-7 was the operation of a real estate agency defined as a business and the operation of a real estate agency was not prohibited or even mentioned. The court noted that nowhere in the ordinance was it specifically provided that the term &quot;professional person&quot; did not include a real estate agent or broker. The court concluded that the ordinance was impermissibly vague because the corporation was not given prior notice of the ordinance requirements and town investigators and the courts were not given explicit standards by which uniform application of the ordinance could have been effected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that certain subdivisions of the ordinance were unconstitutional in violation of due process.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the two-pronged void for vagueness test, a statute must first be sufficiently definite so as to provide a fair notice of the required or prohibited conduct, and, second, the statute must provide explicit and objective standards by which a violation may be determined; accordingly, applying such test, a town zoning ordinance which prohibits the operation of a business in a residential district but permits the incidental use of a residence for an office of a &quot;physician, lawyer, architect, teacher or similar professional person residing on the premises&quot;, is unconstitutionally vague since defendant realty agency, which is charged with operating a real estate agency from the residence of its sole stockholder in violation of the ordinance, is not given sufficient prior notice that its conduct is prohibited by the ordinance in that nowhere in the ordinance is the operation of a real estate agency defined as a &quot;business&quot; and nowhere is the term &quot;professional person&quot; defined; in order to determine whether defendant violated the permitted accessory use ordinance, the court would have to undertake&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a cumbersome analysis to determine whether a real estate agent is a &quot;similar professional person&quot; thereby making objective and uniform enforcement of the ordinance impossible.  </SPAN></P>

The maternal grandparents' argued that, as a matter of law, the father had no absolute right to veto the adoption of his child and even if he did possess such a right, he forfeited it by abandoning the infant. The father contended that he was in the army and was later discharged for a mental breakdown for which he was hospitalized for six or seven months. He claimed that he visited the baby and phoned to inquire about the child's welfare and thus, did not abandon the child. He contended that in the absence of a finding of abandonment, his consent was required to the adoption. The court found in favor of the father, and held that the maternal grandparents failed to prove abandonment. Thus, the father had the absolute right as a matter of law to veto the granting of the adoption application. While the father's relationship with his child fell short of that of a model parent, there was no proof that he purposefully failed to fulfill his parental obligations and was willing to decline his parental rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county filed charges against defendant for violating the county's consumer protection code by making false and misleading representations to a customer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who ran a water control business, allegedly made false and misleading representations to a customer in connection with eliminating the wetness and flooding in the customer's basement. The county charged defendant with violating its consumer protection code, and defendant challenged the law's constitutionality. Defendant also requested an order for a bill of particulars, discovery and inspection, a pre-trial Sandoval hearing, and dismissal. The court affirmed the constitutionality of the code, granted the request for a pre-trial hearing, and issued a ruling as to the other issues in a separate memorandum. The court held that while defendant was entitled to attack the constitutionality of the code, he was required to overcome a strong presumption that the legislation was valid, and he failed to do so. Even though more precise language could have been used, this by itself did not invalidate the law, and it was an appropriate exercise of police power. However, even in a nonjury trial, defendant was entitled to a pre-trial hearing to obtain an advance ruling as to the use by the prosecution of evidence of defendant's prior convictions and bad acts for impeachment purposes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Consumer Protection -- County Consumer Protection Code -- Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A county Consumer Protection Code, which provides criminal sanctions for certain deceptive trade practices, is a constitutional exercise of police power in that the county has a legitimate interest in the rights of its citizens in their dealings with merchants, particularly where unfair practices may be involved; in addition, there is a fair and reasonable connection between the legislation and the promotion of public health, safety and welfare since the statutory scheme would encourage competent prosecution of offending merchants even where monetary damages are small and would avoid the difficulties involved in enforcing civil money judgments; furthermore, it is not fatal if the enactment incidentally criminalizes traditionally civil wrongdoing since the police power of the State and its subdivisions is broad and comprehensive and in its exercise an individual's conduct is invariably regulated to some degree.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A penal law, which must be construed according to the commonly accepted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  meaning of its language, is void for vagueness when it fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden, but practical necessities may compel a legislative body to assign broad functions to an agency and leave to it the duty of bringing about the results pointed out by the statute; furthermore, when non-First Amendment rights are attacked, a statute is void for vagueness only if it is vague as applied to the precise circumstances of the individual case, and the fact that more precise language could have been employed in drawing a statute does not alone render it unconstitutional.  There is a strong presumption that duly enacted legislation is constitutional and a court of first impression is not bound to set aside a law as unconstitutional unless that conclusion is inescapable and shown beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried by a jury after being indicted by a Grand Jury on several counts of robbery, grand larceny, and criminal possession of a weapon. The jury was discharged after it became deadlocked. On the eve of the second trial, defendant filed a motion for a hearing on the issue of whether the Grand Jury panel underrepresented Hispanics and women, or in the alternative, adjournment of the trial to await a decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defense counsel alleged that he first became aware of a motion pending before a trial court judge that involved the issue of underrepresentation on the eve of the second trial. Defense counsel claimed that although the current motions were brought past the 45-day limit allotted for pretrial motions, N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 255.20(3) allowed the court to entertain and dispose of the motion on the merits in its discretion and in the interest of justice. The court denied the motions. Any challenge to a trial jury panel was to be made in writing, and before the selection of the jury commenced, otherwise it was deemed waived. The selection of petit and grand jurors were interrelated and drawn from the same general pool. Therefore, challenges to either one were considered by the same standards. Logic could not accommodate the notion that at a certain point in time defendant lost his right to challenge the composition of the petit jury but retained, forever, the right to challenge the composition of the Grand Jury when both came from the same source. N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 270.10(2) governed all challenges to the jury panel, and the motion was deemed untimely.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since a challenge to the composition of a Grand Jury is subject to the same 45-day limitation allotted for pretrial omnibus motions to challenge a trial jury panel ( CPL 270.10), the selection of petit and grand jurors being interrelated and drawn from the same general pool, an untimely motion to adjourn defendant's retrial pending the outcome of a constitutional challenge to the composition of the Kings County Grand Jury in another case, is denied; assuming, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">arguendo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that a decision is made that women and Hispanics were underrepresented in the Grand Jury panels due to an improper administration of the Judiciary Law, there is no reason to believe that such decision would be retroactively applicable to a jury impaneled prior to the date of the decision.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, petitioner challenged the manner in which respondent corrections department computed the minimum and maximum term of his sentence for first-degree robbery. The corrections department added delinquent time onto petitioner's sentence and failed to credit him with time served under a prior reformatory sentence pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law art. 75.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner received a reformatory sentence under art. 75, which was later repealed, for a third-degree robbery conviction. Petitioner was later released on parole, was declared delinquent for over five months, and later pleaded guilty to first-degree robbery. The corrections department added the delinquency time onto the minimum sentence for the first-degree robbery conviction and did not credit petitioner with time served on the reformatory sentence. The court declared the date upon which the minimum and maximum sentences for the first-degree robbery conviction began to run and denied petitioner's request for credit for time served under the reformatory sentence. The corrections department conceded that the delinquency time could not be added onto petitioner's sentence because the reformatory sentence statute had been declared unconstitutional. Petitioner was not entitled to credit for time served on the prior sentence because his sentences were not treated as running concurrently. Under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.30(1)(a), credit for time served was allowed if the reformatory sentence were indeterminate and ran concurrently with other sentences.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the reformatory sentence statute is unconstitutional, no court has the power to add unserved reformatory time to the maximum term of imprisonment of a defendant's subsequent intermediate prison sentence, nor should such unserved time be added to the new minimum sentence; moreover, where a person is under more than one indeterminate sentence and all such sentences are to run concurrently, the time served in prison under any of the concurrent sentences must be credited against the minimum of all such sentences. Accordingly, unserved reformatory time must be excluded from the calculation of both the minimum and the maximum terms of a defendant's new indeterminate sentence, received after he was paroled on the reformatory sentence; however, where such sentence was to run consecutively with the reformatory sentence, reformatory time already served will not be credited against the minimum term of the subsequent indeterminate sentence, since the applicable statute (Penal Law, &sect; 70.30, subd 1, par [a]) would allow such credit only if the reformatory sentence is treated as an indeterminate sentence and the two sentences are treated as running&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  concurrently. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree criminal sale of a controlled substance and awaited sentencing. The statutory minimum was 15 years to life. His codefendants pleaded guilty to a lesser-included offense of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and received indeterminate one to three year sentences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and three others were charged with first-degree criminal sale of a controlled substance and first degree criminal possession of a controlled substance involving slightly less than four ounces of cocaine, both class A-I felonies. It was an amateurish operation from which defendant could make only a few hundred dollars. While defendant claimed that he was entrapped, rejected plea offers, and elected to go to trial (where he was convicted), his codefendants pleaded to lesser-included offenses. While they generally were sentenced to serve one to three years, defendant faced a minimum sentence of 15 years to life. Defendant claimed that the disparity constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Constitution. The court agreed. Considering defendant's culpability and involvement relative to that of his codefendants, the court held that there was a shocking disparity and a gross disproportion between the sentences and that the longer sentence required to be imposed on defendant could not be imposed without violating the Constitution. The court noted, however, that defendant nonetheless was not entitled to the same sentence afforded to those who pleaded guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared its intention to sentence defendant within the range permissible for an A-II felony, that is, a minimum of three years to life and a maximum of eight years to life.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the severity of the sentence structure with respect to class A felonies involving controlled substances does not, per se, constitute cruel and unusual punishment, an individualized case-by-case examination of the breadth of the gap between law and justice or the gross disparity of sentences among like defendants charged with acting in concert with respect to the same offense, is permissible to determine if a sentence imposed in accordance with the applicable statute would constitute a deprivation of defendant's constitutional rights; accordingly, the gross disproportion and shocking disparity between the sentences of defendant, who elected to go to trial on class A-I cocaine sale charges and, as a result, faces a statutory minimum sentence of 15 years to life, and his equally culpable codefendants who pleaded guilty to a lesser class A-III charge and have been sentenced to serve indeterminate terms of one to three years, renders the imposition of the mandated sentence an unconstitutional application of the statute and defendant will, therefore, be sentenced to a minimum of three years to life and a maximum&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of eight years to life, the range permissible for an A-II felony. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The presumption of constitutionality which ordinarily&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  attaches to statutes can be rebutted by impingement upon essential or basic constitutional rights, such as parental rights; the higher the right is regarded, the more jealously the courts guard it against government intrusion.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner father, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the first degree in connection with the death of his wife and was sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment, was not denied substantive due process (US Const, 14 Amdt) under section 111 (subd 2, par [d]) of the Domestic Relations Law, which provides that consent to adoption is not required of a parent who has been deprived of civil rights, and under subdivision 1 of section 79 of the Civil Rights Law, which provides that an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment suspends, during the term of the sentence, the civil rights of the person sentenced, at a custody and adoption proceeding involving his 21-month-old daughter, whose maternal great aunt and her husband sought to adopt the child, the child having been placed with her great grandfather following her mother's death; although parental rights are among the most basic of rights, petitioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has demonstrated his unfitness by his own acts, and the best interests of the child are served by denying petitioner substantive rights in the proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The State has the power to deny constitutional rights, even the most basic and fundamental of these rights, in order to preserve the constitutional protection and public welfare of the State as a whole, and when the State decides that for the greater good of all a distinction must be drawn between one class of persons and another, it must do so in a manner that will not offend the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution; the classification must be structured in a reasonable manner, must not be arbitrary, and the generalization reflected by the claimed classification must be true of the majority of the members of the class.  A State does not violate the guarantee merely because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect, and a statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Presumptions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. It is presumed that the Legislature has investigated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and found facts necessary to support legislation passed by it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Equal protection of the law is not denied when all persons are treated alike under like circumstances and conditions, both in the privileges conferred and in the liabilities imposed; the State does not have the power, under the equal protection clause (US Const, 14th Amdt), to legislate that different treatment be accorded to persons placed by a statute into different classes on the basis of criteria wholly unrelated to the objective of that statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Consent of Imprisoned Father</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Petitioner father, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the first degree in connection with the death of his wife and was sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment, was not denied equal protection of the law (US Const, 14th Amdt) under section 111 (subd 2, par [d]) of the Domestic Relations Law, which provides that consent to adoption is not required of a parent who has been deprived of civil rights, and under subdivision 1 of section 79 of the Civil Rights Law, which provides that an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment suspends, during the term&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the sentence, the civil rights of the person sentenced, at a custody and adoption proceeding involving his 21-month-old daughter, whose maternal great aunt and her husband sought to adopt the child, the child having been placed with her great grandfather following her mother's death; the application of section 79 in the instant case is neither arbitrary nor unduly discriminatory, and is a proper exercise of the police power, and moreover, petitioner has not established the unreasonableness of the legislative enactments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Presumption of Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. There is a strong presumption that a statute duly enacted by the Legislature is constitutional, and for a court to declare a law unconstitutional, the invalidity must be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt.  </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. art. 78 to review a determination by respondent New York Tax Commission that denied the taxpayer credit for any sales and use taxes for any item purchased by the taxpayer prior to May 31, 1970. The Commission contended that the three-year statute of limitations established in N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1139(a) was an absolute bar to the allowance of any credit for such taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer reached an agreement with the Commission on June 1, 1973 that modified the taxpayer's method of paying its sales and use taxes for inventory items. That modification provided that the taxes were to be paid as the items were withdrawn from inventory while previously the taxes were paid as the items were purchased. In order to avoid any overpayment the taxpayer filed its next four quarterly tax returns filed after June 1, 1973 with a credit taken for taxes paid on all items that were in inventory as of that date. The Commission issued a notice of determination that demanded payment of all taxes due on those returns on the basis that the credit was barred by the three-year statute of limitations under &sect; 1139(a). The taxpayer instituted a review proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 and the court annulled the determination and remanded the cause to the Commission for further review on the basis that the three-year statute of limitations applied only to refunds or credits of any tax, penalty, or interest erroneously, illegally, or unconstitutionally collected or paid, which was not the case with the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the case did not apply because it contained no discussion of &sect; 1192(4), the provision under which defendant was charged.

The court further found it arbitrary that the Commissioner would not restore the driver's license without proof that the judgment was satisfied, proof of a payment schedule to satisfy judgment, or an order vacating the judgment with no potential for appeal, as there was no provision for the posting of an undertaking pending appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a judicial declaration that defendant city unconstitutionally levied real property taxes, the city passed Ordinance No. 79/307 of the Common Council of the City of Rochester, New York, which authorized refund of the taxes so levied. Plaintiff taxpayers brought an action to declare the city's ordinance unconstitutional and to recover the excess taxes they paid under protest. The taxpayers filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that the ordinance was constitutional and that it provided for an administrative procedure to settle the claims for overpayment of taxes. The city also argued that the taxpayers were not entitled to a refund for certain tax years because the statutes under which those taxes were levied had never been declared invalid. The court granted the motion and held that the ordinance was patently unconstitutional. The court reasoned that stripped of the verbiage that characterized the ordinance, or &quot;capital levy,&quot; as a method to refund to the taxpayers the excess taxes paid by them, the city had actually &quot;robbed Peter to pay Paul.&quot; The taxpayers were entitled to establish their rights to repayment of the real property taxes paid in excess of the constitutional limitation. The judicial declaration, which prompted the ordinance, accorded refunds without the necessity of any review by the city's common council, and there was no justification for such a procedure in the present case. Thus, the court awarded judgment to the taxpayers for the excess levies made by the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, was guardian of the decedent's property of that of her nonmarital infant son. She and the decedent never married but had a son together. On the child's original birth certificate, no one was listed as the father. Later, both decedent and petitioner executed a form for the purpose of having the decedent named as the father on a corrected birth certificate. Although the form did not contain an acknowledgement and their signatures were not witnessed, a corrected birth certificate was executed. Decedent's mother opposed the application on the ground that N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trust Law &sect; 4-1.2 precluded the infant from inheriting from the decedent in the absence of a court of competent jurisdiction having entered an order of filiation declaring paternity of the infant. The court agreed and held that because there has been no judicial determination during decedent's lifetime as to his paternity of the child, the infant could not a distributee who could inherit from decedent. The court dismissed the guardian's petition and ordered that letters of administration be issued to the decedent's mother upon her filing a petition requesting the same and duly qualifying according to law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since there has been no judicial determination during the decedent's lifetime as to his paternity of the nonmarital child, even though the decedent was named as the father on a corrected birth certificate and his signature on this form was sworn to before a commissioner of deeds, the infant is not a distributee who can inherit from decedent and therefore petitioner, in her status as guardian of the infant's property, has no interest in this estate which would entitle her to receive letters of administration; although EPTL 4-1.2 (subd [a], par [2]) as of the date of decedent's death provided that an illegitimate child could inherit from his father only in the event of an order of filiation declaring paternity, the amended EPTL 4-1.2, effective May 29, 1979, which liberalized the inheritance rights of nonmarital children, is of no solace to petitioner because the instrument which decedent executed relating to the corrected birth certificate was neither executed with the formalities required by the statute nor was it filed with the Putative Father Registry; in any event, it does not appear that the Legislature intended to apply, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or that it could have constitutionally applied, the amendment to the statute retroactively to the property of decedent's dying prior to its effective date, since such distributive interests would have already indefeasibly vested in those entitled to a distributive interest in decedent's property on the date of decedent's death under the statutes existing on that date.  </SPAN></P>

Provisions in the separation agreement were made for child support and division of property, but no provision was made for alimony for the wife. The wife claimed that she was entitled to alimony because of the length of marriage and her earning capacity. The wife contended that her waiver of support in the separation agreement was invalid by virtue of N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law &sect; 5-311 which prohibited a husband from contracting to relieve himself from supporting his wife. The court held that &sect; 5-311 was unconstitutional because it advanced a gender-based discrimination that was unable to have withstood the equal protection scrutiny. The court's determination regarding the unconstitutionally of &sect; 5-311 was not to have been applied retroactively. The matter was referred to the trial court for a determination as to the issue of the wife's entitlement to alimony from the date of the separation agreement to the date of the decision declaring &sect; 5-311&nbsp;unconstitutional and for a determination of any entitlement to attorney fees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both plaintiff citizens and defendant city filed motions for summary judgment to decide whether statutes authorizing the promulgation of special equalization ratios were an unconstitutional evasion of the tax and debt-contracting powers of the state's various municipal divisions as set forth in the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statutes at issue were enacted to allow certain municipal divisions the ability to tax at the maximum constitutional limit by permitting, for that purpose only, the recalculation of the applicable ratios used in determining &quot;average full valuation.&quot; The court granted summary judgment in favor of the city, dismissing the citizens' complaint. The court did not find that the legislature had acted without the letter of the state constitution. The court determined that the ratios, of necessity, were flexible and defied precise accuracy. The court determined, therefore, that there was no constitutional mandate of any set method of determining the equalization ratio. The court concluded that the legislature remained within the letter of the state constitution because it had not stepped beyond the taxing ceiling, but merely exercised its authorized discretion to determine the equalization ratio, which figure, adjustable by nature, constituted one part of the formula used in calculating the constitutional limit itself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Articles 12-A and 12-B of the Real Property Tax Law, which permit the State Board of Equalization and Assessment to establish special equalization ratios and thereby raise the constitutional taxing limit on real property, are not unconstitutional devices for allowing a municipality to levy more taxes, since section 10 of article VIII of the State Constitution gives the Legislature the authority to determine these ratios and this authority has been delegated to the State Board of Equalization and Assessment which, after reviewing more current, more accurate and fairer information, may recalculate the ratios, which are not final constants, but rather flexible and imprecise factors that make up the taxing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  limit; there is no constitutional mandate as to their method of determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to plaintiff's motion to confirm order of seizure, defendants claimed the grant of order of seizure without notice violated constitutional due process requirements. The court found there was a strong presumption of constitutionality that attached to an act of the legislature, and the presumption could have only been overcome by clear and convincing proof, persuasive beyond a reasonable doubt. Procedural due process requirements were met whether an order of seizure was granted after a hearing on notice or without notice with an immediate confirmation hearing on notice. The court held an order of confirming seizure without notice may have been granted only upon a showing of exigent circumstances under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7102(d), and if later found unwarranted, plaintiff could have been liable for damages, including attorney's fees under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7108. The record established plaintiff had access to the property prior to and subsequent to the seizure, and there was no intent by defendants to move or dispose or otherwise alter or damage the property. Therefore, the court held plaintiff did not meet its statutory burden and denied its motion to confirm the order of seizure.</SPAN></P>

Under &sect; 70.08(1)(a), defendant's present convictions were violent felonies under N.Y.

Accordingly, custody of a child born out of wedlock was awarded to her unmarried father, who had openly acknowledged paternity and maintained an ongoing relationship with the child, with liberal visitation rights to the mother, where the best interests of the child indicated that custody should be given to the father, even though the mother had not abandoned her right to custody and was not shown to be unfit or improper as a parent.  </SPAN></P>

The commissioner filed a paternity petition against the putative father. The putative father was ordered to pay support per week, disbursed to the commissioner.

The putative father filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the grounds that (1) he was not represented by counsel during the prior proceedings, and (2) the order of filiation was obtained after the statute of limitations. The court dismissed the petition to modify the commissioner's order of support, and vacated the order awarding payment of support to the commissioner. The court held that the mother had to file an action under N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 413 seeking support and alleging that the putative father was the father of the child.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state brought an action against the residents for allowing political signs on their properties. The state contended that its enactments were permissible since they reflected valid legislative concern for aesthetic interests and that the regulations fell within the time, place, and manner limitation on speech. The residents claimed that the ordinance violated the equal protection clause and infringed on First Amendment rights. The court ruled in favor of the residents, declaring the ordinance void. The court held that because the ordinance made an arbitrary distinction between political and nonpolitical signs, analysis in terms of the equal protection clause was in order. The court found that the ordinance was unnecessarily restrictive and predicated upon a discriminatory scheme of classification. The court held that the scheme was restrictive of fundamental rights and unsupported by compelling state interests and, thus, was unconstitutional. The state did not show that there was an appropriate government interest furthered by the differential treatment and absent a compelling justification for such classification, such disparate treatment was impermissible.</SPAN></P>

In response, the State claimed that assuming that any deficiency as to notice existed, it was subject to cure by the filing of additional pleadings. The court granted the motion. Noting that strict construction of the relevant statutes was required, the court held that the petition was infirm because it did not provide notice in conformity with minimum procedural due process standards. Rejecting the claim that the attack on the petition related to a &quot;mere technicality,&quot; the court held that it was the petition and the petition alone that constitutes the pleading to which the juvenile had to respond and that the petition, therefore, had to meet constitutional due process standards. Because the petition was the sole source of notice for the proceedings for constitutional purposes, the fact that clarifying information might be found in other files did not and could not remedy the defect which required dismissal of the petition.</SPAN></P>

The tenant had been given the right to purchase her apartment, which she refused, and had been given the right to match any offer, which she also refused. The tenant, pursuant to the requirement of the rent stabilization guidelines, was allowed to remain in her apartment until either the end of her lease, or one year from date of issuance of the formal prospectus, whichever was longer. The longer period expired on June 2, 1979. The tenant refused to leave, claiming that she was protected by 1979 N.Y. Laws ch. 432. The court found the new law constitutional, noting that its protection of persons of low income who were more than 62 years old was valid. However, the new law did not affect co-operative conversion plans that were declared effective before its enactment and it could not be interpreted to have any retroactive effect.

He sought dismissal of the indictment on constitutional grounds but the court found no merit to his claim and it denied the motion. Noting that there was no constitutional right to be treated as a juvenile, it held that the challenged laws were not directed to any class of persons based on race, national origin, religion, or sex. It ruled that the &quot;rational basis&quot; test was applicable; that the gravity of the crime charged was a rational basis for distinguishing treatment; and that the legislative classification, treating juveniles charged with serious crimes differently than those charged with nonserious crimes, did not violate defendant's constitutional rights. The court also rejected attacks on the constitutionality of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 180.75. Because defendant had been accorded all of his constitutional rights, he was not entitled to challenge it. Moreover, a claim that the law lacked standards was baseless because the critical standard, whether transfer was in the interests of justice, was clear. A related equal protection challenge based on differences in penalties was rejected as premature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Juvenile Offenders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Where a statute is attacked as violative of equal protection of the law, the courts have applied either the strict scrutiny or the rational basis test, determining first whether the statute operates to the disadvantage of some specific class or impinges upon a fundamental right explicitly or implicitly protected by the Constitution, thereby requiring strict judicial scrutiny, and then, if it does not, whether it rationally furthers some legitimate, articulated State purpose and therefore does not constitute an invidious discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, since there is no fundamental right for a youth charged with criminal conduct to be treated as a juvenile, and since the juvenile offender law (L 1978, ch 481; Penal Law, &sect; 10.00, subd 18; &sect; 30.00), which makes persons between the ages of 13 and 15 criminally responsible for certain specified crimes, was not directed at any class of individuals on account of race, national origin, religion, or sex, the rational basis test is appropriate to test the constitutionality of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such statute; the juvenile offender statutes do not violate a youthful defendant's right to equal protection of the law since the Legislature has classified the treatment of defendants based upon the seriousness of the crime, with the intention that those young persons who commit serious violations of the Penal Law be treated differently than those young persons who commit nonserious violations, a rational basis for the distinction in treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Standing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In determining whether a petitioner has standing to sue, it must be shown that petitioner's personal or property rights will be directly and specifically affected by the matter in controversy; a petitioner making a general attack on legislative or administrative action or inaction must demonstrate special damages distinct from that suffered by the public at large.  Accordingly, where a juvenile offender has been afforded all of the rights that he claims are not provided by CPL 180.75, the statute permitting removal of an action against a juvenile offender from a criminal court to the Family Court under certain circumstances -- adequate notice to the parent and child of the charges, the opportunity&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to retain counsel and the right to call witnesses on his behalf -- he lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute on those grounds as violative of procedural due process and equal protection under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Juvenile Offenders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The burden of showing the unconstitutionality of a statute is on the party asserting it, who must demonstrate such fact beyond a reasonable doubt; the courts are guided by the principle that an inferior court should exercise restraint in declaring a statute unconstitutional, using such power only in rare cases involving life and liberty, and where the invalidity of the act is apparent on its face.  Accordingly, the contention that CPL 180.75, which makes persons between the ages of 13 and 15 criminally responsible for certain specified crimes, but permits removal of an action against a juvenile offender from a criminal court to the Family Court where it is determined that to do so would be in the interests of justice, fails to provide specific standards and criteria to control the court in its decision to transfer or to retain jurisdiction is without&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  merit, since the possibility that some juveniles would be arbitrarily transferred to the adult criminal justice system, thereby subjecting them to significantly harsher potential penalties than could be imposed upon the majority of juveniles who engaged in similar antisocial behavior in violation of their constitutional rights, is not present in the New York plan, under which all juveniles accused of certain designated crimes are subject to the adult criminal system, except in those unusual cases in which treatment as a juvenile is deemed appropriate; moreover, there is no violation of defendant's right of due process under the juvenile offender law when he is not afforded a removal hearing in the criminal court, because the superior court has the inherent power to transfer the case to the Family Court in the interest of justice pursuant to CPL 210.40 when it becomes aware of exceptional circumstances that would warrant transferring the case to the Family Court, nor is said interests of justice standard constitutionally infirm, since legislative enactments permitting the courts to make a variety of determinations based on this standard have been an integral part of the criminal procedural&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  process for many years and criteria thereunder have been set forth by various courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Juvenile Offenders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The contention that the juvenile offender law (L 1978, ch 481) violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution in that a person under the age of 16 who is convicted of the same crime as a person between the ages of 16 and 19 may not receive youthful offender treatment while the latter group may, is premature when raised by a juvenile defendant who has not been tried and convicted. Accordingly, the court will not pass on that issue.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with having committed the crime of criminal usury. He moved to declare the statute under which he was charged, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 190.42, unconstitutional on the grounds that it was void for vagueness. Defendant claimed the statute failed to define what would constitute a &quot;scheme or business&quot; of making usurious loans. The trial court denied the motion, upholding the constitutionality of &sect; 190.42, reasoning that &sect; 190.42 specified that one committed criminal usury when he knowingly charged interest on any loan at a rate exceeding 25 percent. A strong presumption of validity attached to statutes and all legislative enactments were deemed to be constitutional until the invalidity of the law had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The prohibition against excessive vagueness did not invalidate every statute that a reviewing court believed could have been drafted with greater precision. Under the circumstances, the conduct barred by &sect; 190.42 was reasonably clear, and thus it passed constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss the charges of criminal usury was denied. The statute was not held unconstitutionally vague since it informed a reasonable person of the prohibited conduct.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, section 190.42 of the Penal Law, which criminalizes conduct that is part of a &quot;scheme or business&quot; of making or collecting usurious loans, is not so vague or standardless that it fails to meet due process requirements; it does not leave the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibits or Judges and jurors free to decide, without legally fixed standards, what is prohibited and what&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is not in each particular case. </SPAN></P>

Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 5-4.3, could have been construed to permit recovery of punitive damages. The court disagreed. Punitive damages were not recoverable under &sect; 5-4.3. The language of the statute made clear that pecuniary injuries included payment of expenses resulting from the accident born by the survivor. It did not broaden the compensatory nature of the recovery to include punitive damages. Neither was there any basis to support the survivor's contention that the language of the statute evidenced a legislative intent to permit recovery of punitive damages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 1310 required persons who walked dogs in New York cities with populations of 400,000 or more to remove feces left by the dogs and deposit the feces in a suitable container. The dog owners attacked &sect; 1310 on various constitutional grounds, including interference with the right to own property and vagueness. The dog owners, among other things, asserted that &sect; 1310 discriminated against Jews, who were not permitted to work on the Sabbath. The dog owners filed an action to have &sect; 1310 declared unconstitutional, and the case went before the court on the parties' competing motions. The court dismissed the complaint insofar as it sought injunctive relief and granted summary judgment to the state, declaring the statute to be constitutional. The court held that a statute designed to foster the health and welfare of a state's people was a reasonable and proper exercise of the state's police power. Section 1310 did not in any way strain the bounds of constitutionality. Section 1310 was sufficiently specific, and it did not intrude on the religious freedom of Jewish citizens. Even where a recognized religious practice was inimical to public health, such practice could be overridden.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the board's motion for an order dismissing the action to the extent of dismissing the not-for-profit corporation as a party plaintiff to the action. The not-for-profit corporation lacked capacity to sue because it was not a taxpayer within the meaning of &sect; 51. The court agreed with the board that the portion of the complaint that sought to vacate the entire 1978 tax roll of the city should be stricken. The court denied the board's motion in all other respects, reasoning that the court would uphold any fair and nondiscriminatory assessment method that appeared most likely to ensure that the existence of varied patterns of land use and ownership would not frustrate the design that each contribute equitably to the public fisc.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Since plaintiff New York Public Interest Research Group, a not-for-profit corporation whose purpose is to advocate the interest of consumers and taxpayers of the State, does not own any property or pay any taxes within the City or County of Albany, it is not a taxpayer and it therefore lacks standing to maintain a taxpayer's action (General Municipal Law, &sect; 51) attacking the manner in which real property assessments in the City of Albany are determined; the fact that some of plaintiff's members are taxpayers does not allow plaintiff to maintain the action on behalf of its members since, although section 51 is to be liberally construed, no matter how broadly the language is construed, the statute still requires that for a potential litigant to come within its purview, the litigant must be a taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A landowner operated a junkyard on his property. Respondent town charged the landowner with four counts of violating a town zoning ordinance and one count of violating a town local law for operating the junkyard. The landowner was ordered to remove all the junk from his premises, cease and desist operation of the junkyard, and was fined. The landowner sought review. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held: (1) the initial zoning ordinance was invalid because of procedural defects in its adoption; (2) the curative statute did not validate the zoning ordinance retrospectively because the application of the curative statute in the present case would have created an ordinance when none existed, and would have conferred the town to do something during a period it had no jurisdiction to do; and (3) the landowner had a vested right to operate a junkyard, and the curative statute could not operate to divest that right retroactively.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A curative statute enacted by the State Legislature (L 1978, ch 377) to validate a Town of Coeymans zoning ordinance which, when originally enacted in 1961 was invalid and inoperative because of procedural defects in its adoption, validates the local zoning ordinance prospectively only from the effective date of the curative statute, June 19, 1978; although curative statutes traditionally constitute an exception to the general rule against retroactive application, to allow retroactive application of this curative statute would &quot;create&quot; an ordinance at a time when none existed, would confer upon the Town of Coeymans jurisdiction to do something during a period of time it had no jurisdiction to do it, and to divest defendant of a vested right without compensation; accordingly, since defendant purchased his land in 1970 to operate a junkyard, the junkyard is a prior nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>

While the court ruled that &sect; 412 was discriminatory in nature, it also ruled that the court had the inherent power to remedy the discrimination without invalidating the statute. As such, the court read &sect; 412 in a gender-neutral manner and interpreted it to afford equal eligibility to support for husbands and wives. In so ruling, the court noted the problems that invalidating the statute would have caused.

Defendants unsuccessfully argued the obscenity statute was subject to a strict scrutiny analysis, it was unconstitutional, and argued unconstitutionally of the affirmative defenses under section 235.15(2). The court held that obscenity was not protected by the U.S. Const. amend. I, and it was not entitled to a strict scrutiny analysis. The affirmative defenses challenged in section 235.15(2) were argued prematurely as they did not come into play until a factual determination of obscenity had been made. The burden of proof was on defendants to establish invalidity of the statute beyond a reasonable doubt, and only a clear violation of the U.S. Constitution justified the court to overrule legislative will.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff grandmother filed a motion for summary judgment in her action against defendant school district for a declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction, and damages. The school district also sought summary judgment. A trial court justice found that the grandmother was a custodian of her grandchildren under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3212(1) and granted a temporary injunction against the district, ordering it to enroll her grandchildren in school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district denied enrollment to the grandchildren on the ground that their grandmother could not establish she had been judicially appointed their legal guardian. The grandmother sought a declaration that Roosevelt Union Free School District No. 8, Policy Bulletins Nos. 501 and 502 were unconstitutional and invalid in that they purported to exclude from admission any child who resided with a person other than his parent or legal guardian. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the grandmother on the issue of her grandchildren's right to enrollment. Although the written policy did not violate &sect; 3212(1), the school district's more restrictive interpretation of the policy did violate &sect; 3212(1). The court held that any policy interpretation that limited registration to only those children for whom a legally appointed guardianship had been obtained was invalid and unenforceable. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the district as to the grandmother's request for a permanent injunction and damages. The situation required legal redress, which the justice's order had already provided, not compensation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stated policy of defendant school district, which provides for latitude with respect to the enrollment of children who do not reside with their parents or legal guardians into the district's schools, is not violative of a statute which places the duty of &quot;causing a minor to attend&quot; school upon the person standing in parental relationship to the minor ( Education Law, &sect; 3212, subd 1), which relationship encompasses more than parenthood and judicial guardianship; however, any interpretation of the district's policy which has the effect of limiting registration to only those children for whom a legally appointed guardianship has been obtained, is invalid and unenforceable; a permanent injunction has been rendered academic by virtue of a court order requiring defendant to enroll plaintiff's grandchildren in its schools and a determination with respect to damages arising from the district's refusal to enroll the children is inappropriate since the situation required legal redress and not compensation.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother filed a paternity proceeding against respondent, the administratrix of the putative father's estate, alleging that the decedent was the natural father of her daughter. The administratrix filed a motion pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211(a)(7) for an order dismissing the petition for failure to state a cause of action, relying upon N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 4-1.2(a)(2)(A), which governed inheritance by illegitimate persons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administratrix claimed that under &sect; 4-1.2(a)(2)(A), the court could not enter a filiation order where the putative father had died prior to commencement of the action. The administratrix argued that &sect; 4-1.2(a)(2)(A) required an order of filiation to be entered declaring paternity during the lifetime of the putative father in a proceeding instituted during the mother's pregnancy or within two years from the child's birth. The mother argued that she was not asking for a finding that the child was entitled to share in the decedent's estate, but only for an adjudication of paternity and an order of filiation. Examining the legislative history, the court found that the statute was not intended to impair the family court's jurisdiction; thus, it did not per se prohibit the family court from entering an order of filiation subsequent to the putative father's death. However, the court found that the family court was a creation of statutory law, possessing only those powers vested in it by the Legislature, and that there was no statute authorizing it to make such a finding. Thus, the court was required to follow the common law rule of abatement upon the putative father's death.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  EPTL 4-1.2 (subd [a], par [2], cl [A]), which requires an illegitimate child to obtain an order of filiation during the lifetime of the putative father in order to inherit from him, is substantially related to the permissible State interest of fostering orderly estate administration and was not intended to impair the jurisdiction of the Family Court, which has no jurisdiction over estate administration, and, therefore, does not prohibit the Family Court from entering an order of filiation subsequent to the death of the putative father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Abatement and Revival -- Paternity Proceeding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A paternity proceeding against a putative father who died prior to the commencement of the proceeding must be dismissed since there is no statutory authority in article 5 of the Family Court Act to abrogate the common-law rule of abatement upon the death of the putative father. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged use of an earlier methadone conviction as a predicate felony conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.06 was amended in response to complaints that it treated citizens who committed offenses out of state more harshly than those who committed the identical offense in New York. Under the amended version, only foreign offenses that were presently considered serious transgressions of New York law were to be considered predicate felonies. Because the statute did not provide that a prior New York conviction needed to be similarly based on an offense that was presently a felony in New York, a person who committed a prior offense in New York would be judged by the community norms of New York prevailing at the time of the offense, whereas a person committing the same offense in New Jersey would be judged by the current norms of New York. The court noted that defendant's prior methadone conviction was based on an offense that was at that time, and for a brief period thereafter, a felony and that it was now a misdemeanor. There was no rational basis for treating defendant more harshly than someone with a similar out-of-state conviction. To do so denied him the equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that defendant was not subject to a predicate felony conviction by reason of his methadone conviction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Predicate Felony</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 70.06 of the Penal Law, in defining predicate felonies, creates an unjust classification which lacks any rational relationship to a legitimate State interest in its treatment of persons with prior felony convictions obtained against them in New York State, in that a crime committed in this State is not to be viewed in light of the felony norms that existed at that time, while a crime committed in another jurisdiction is to be viewed in light of the felony norms that presently exist in this State; accordingly, a defendant who was convicted in this State of possession of methadone, when that was a felony, would have that conviction counted against him as a predicate felony even though that crime is now a misdemeanor, whereas had he been convicted of that same offense in another State, that conviction would be treated as a misdemeanor and would not be considered a predicate felony; therefore, a defendant with a prior New York conviction receives harsher treatment solely because of the geographical location of his crime, which is not only a denial of equal protection of the law, but contrary to the Legislature's intent to reduce&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the punishment for possession of methadone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Predicate Felony</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The conviction for an act, possession of methadone, that was erroneously classified as a felony by the Legislature, which quickly amended and reclassified it as a misdemeanor, may not be used against a defendant as a predicate felony, since the revival of its felony status would be contrary to both the legislative intent and the basic principles of justice and fairness.  </SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the father could not be disqualified, solely on the basis of sex, as a party respondent in the proceedings because he had the right to consent to the adoption of his out-of-wedlock children. The court held that any distinction between the rights of unmarried mothers and the rights of unmarried fathers was not substantially related to an important state interest and that the commissioner could not terminate the father's parental rights without a finding that he permanently neglected his children.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that from the evidence it was clear that the events which the opponents feared were at least several years away and that they may never have come to pass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his plea of guilty, defendant, a juvenile, filed a motion to dismiss an indictment on the grounds that the sentencing provisions of 1978 N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State opposed defendant's motion, asserting that ch. 481 suffered from no constitutional deficiencies as they related to defendant. The court treated the motion as one requesting that the alleged unconstitutional portion of ch. 481 be disregarded for purposes of sentencing, and that defendant be considered as eligible for youthful offender treatment.The court noted that given the presumption that the grand jury performed its duties in accordance with law, the question of removal to family court was already considered but rejected. In addition, there was no constitutional right to youthful offender treatment. While defendant was not eligible for youthful offender adjudication, he did have available comparable ameliorative treatment under ch. 481. He was subject to the prospects of greater relief and greater opportunity for such relief. There was thus no basis for a finding of a denial of equal protection of law or due process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Where a 14-year-old juvenile offender, following his plea of guilty to a violent felony offense (Penal Law, &sect; 30.00, subd 2), moves to dismiss the indictment against him on the grounds that the sentencing provisions of chapter 481 of the Laws of 1978 are violative of his constitutional rights to equal protection of the laws, due process of law and protection against cruel and inhuman punishment in that, because of the classification scheme created by such laws, he is being denied consideration for youthful offender treatment solely because of his age and he will be subject to a mandatory period of imprisonment if a simultaneous motion for removal to Family Court is not granted (Penal Law, &sect; 70.05, subd 4), such grounds do not set forth a basis for dismissal of the indictment, particularly since the court has the option on sentencing to construe the challenged statute in a constitutional manner.  Accordingly, under such circumstances, the court will treat the motion as one requesting that the allegedly unconstitutional portion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the statute be disregarded for purposes of sentencing, and that the defendant be considered as eligible for youthful offender treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Legislative enactments are presumptively constitutional, and a heavy burden rests with the defendant asserting the contrary to be true; if there is any doubt as to the constitutionality of a statute, the enactment should be upheld.  Accordingly, a trial court should not set aside a legislative enactment unless such conclusion of unconstitutionality is inescapable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Juvenile Offenders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The sentencing provisions of chapter 481 of the Laws of 1978 are not violative of the constitutional rights of a 14-year-old juvenile offender, who pleaded guilty to a violent felony offense (Penal Law, &sect; 30.00, subd 2), to equal protection of the laws and due process of law as a denial of consideration for youthful offender treatment ( CPL art 720) based solely on his age, or the right to be protected against cruel and inhuman punishment in that he will be subject to a mandatory period of imprisonment if a motion for removal to Family Court ( CPL 330.25) is not granted (US Const, 5th, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  8th, 14th Amdts), since the provisions of chapter 481 of the Laws of 1978 contain a number of ameliorative mechanisms providing for removal to Family Court at four different stages of the proceeding with the same practical consequences as attach to an adjudication as a youthful offender under CPL article 720, namely, sealed records and the potential of substantially reduced incarceration for the offender; moreover, there is no constitutional right to youthful offender treatment, which treatment is afforded only upon a favorable exercise of discretion by the sentencing court, the same possibility or opportunity for ameliorative relief which is afforded under the provisions of chapter 481; nor does such legislation reflect invidious discrimination because of age, but rather reflects a reasoned response in defining the penal responsibility of such offenders, since such juvenile offender may receive a substantially lesser period of imprisonment than a nonjuvenile violent felony offender. </SPAN></P>

The board terminated the principal's employment as principal at the end of a probation period at the second of the schools. The principal asserted that the board's by-laws required him to be continued in his position as principal after three years of service until the position was abolished or vacated, and that in addition he had reached an agreement with an assistant superintendent that the new assignment was to be considered as continuous with his previous one. The board contended that the by-law benefited the principal only while he was at the first school under his assistant principal license and that the by-law was unconstitutional. The court found no merit to the board's contentions. Reclassification that conformed the civil service structure to the realities of an agency's operations prior to reclassification was valid. The principal received a permanent appointment by virtue of the by-law. He was in the position for nine years, and equitable estoppel thus applied against the board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the investigation of a judicial election, respondent State Commission on Judicial Conduct (New York) filed a motion for orders compelling petitioner witnesses to continue to testify, pursuant to subpoenas. The witnesses claimed that the questions of the Commission exceeded the scope of its investigation and sought to consolidate their motions with a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding brought by respondent judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission initiated an investigation of the conduct of a judicial candidate related to a fund raising meeting. The witnesses were subpoenaed to testify before the Commission, but refused to answer questions that exceeded the scope of the original complaint. The Commission filed a motion to compel the witnesses' testimony. The witnesses sought to join their motions for a protective order with an art. 78 proceeding instituted by the judge. The trial court granted the witnesses' motion to join the art. 78 proceeding, as the factual issues and principles of law were interrelated. It further granted the motion of the Commission to compel the witnesses to testify. It explained that the original complaints to the Commission had concerned the fund raising meeting and that a wide-ranging investigation of those complaints had produced additional information. However, a newly filed complaint of which the witnesses were unaware, had been based on information from third parties, not from the investigation of the initial complaint. Thus, the new complaint was a proper foundation for the Commission's ongoing investigation, and the witnesses were required to answer questions related to it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An article 78 proceeding is the appropriate procedure to challenge the authority of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct to obtain from subpoenaed witnesses the names of contributors to a judicial election campaign and the reasons for their contributions to the campaign and whether they had contributed to other judicial campaigns since, although prohibition does not usually lie when the investigatory action by an administrative agency is being challenged as being beyond the scope of its authority, since such a grievance is ordinarily correctable on appeal after final determination, such is not the case when a continuance of an unauthorized act might result in grievous harm, and, while the names and addresses of contributors are available as a public record (Election Law, &sect; 14-102), any abuse of that requirement which might cast a chill over the right and freedom of people to associate for proper purposes, must be struck down before the effect of that abuse can be felt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A complaint received by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the State Commission on Judicial Conduct triggers the exercise of the commission's power and sets the proper bounds to the exercise of that power, and since the complaint may not be disclosed to any person except to the Judge involved, the witnesses called to testify before the commission in connection with an investigation have no remedy to determine whether or not their interrogation is within proper bounds except through an article 78 proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Investigation by State Commission on Judicial Conduct</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although a wide-ranging investigation of a Judge conducted by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, not limited to the original complaint which was addressed to the propriety of a particular fund-raising meeting in the judicial election campaign, was beyond the scope of the original authority, a subsequent administrator's complaint filed against the Judge based on other information which had been obtained by the commission from third parties and not from the overly broad investigation of the original complaint, is a proper foundation for the investigation being conducted.</SPAN></P>

The investigation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conducted by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct into the planning of a judicial election campaign and its fund raising and expenditures may properly continue insofar as it relates to alleged improper conduct by, or at the direction of the Judge; the question of whether the Canons of Judicial Ethics may be improper as violative of the right of judicial candidates to obtain support for their candidacies is premature since the complaint does not specify violation of the canons and until the facts are assembled and analyzed through the administrative process no firm conclusions can be drawn.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner commissioner of social services petitioned to declare respondent juvenile, a runaway from Florida, a person in need of supervision (PINS) within the meaning of N.Y. Family Ct. Act &sect; 712(b). When the juvenile failed to return to the trial court on an adjourned date, the juvenile's law guardian filed a motion to dismiss the petition, and the commissioner requested a warrant for the juvenile's arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile, aged 15, ran away from her home in Florida. The commissioner filed a PINS petition to facilitate her return in accordance with the Interstate Compact on Juveniles. The juvenile did not wish to return home, and the trial court remanded her to the commissioner's care. When the juvenile failed to appear for an adjourned hearing date, her law guardian filed a motion to dismiss the petition, and the commissioner sought a warrant for her arrest. The trial court dismissed the petition. It explained that the juvenile had been a resident of Florida and had run away from her home in that state. At the time she ran away, there had been no contact by any interested party, child, or parent with the State of New York. Thus, New York could not detain the juvenile and charge her with being &quot;incorrigible, ungovernable or habitually disobedient,&quot; under N.Y. Family Ct. Act &sect; 712(b), for an act committed in another jurisdiction. It held that the action taken by New York was an unconstitutional assault on the right of the juvenile to travel unimpaired between the various states and contravened the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A petition seeking both that respondent be adjudicated a person in need of supervision and that she be dealt with in accordance with the Interstate Compact on Juveniles in an attempt to fuse two separate and distinct legal procedures is insufficient on its fact to afford relief under either procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Persons in Need of Supervision -- Runaway</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A single act of running away from home does not make a child incorrigible, ungovernable or habitually disobedient within the meaning of subdivision (b) of section 712 of the Family Court Act, and even if the child absconded on several occasions, she could not be adjudged a person in need of supervision absent proof that the child so behaved without just cause.</SPAN></P>

A New York Family Court does not have jurisdiction over an alleged runaway, presently detained in New York for the purpose of adjudicating her a person in need of supervision, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  where the child and her parents were residents of Florida and where the child allegedly ran away from her home in that State; in the case of a child who is mature enough to express potentially conflicting desires, the presumption that she has run away from home, based solely on the observations that she is away from home and unaccompanied by a parent, is constitutionally impermissible; such a presumption may not serve as a jurisdictional basis to adjudicate the juvenile a person in need of supervision in that it unreasonably and unnecessarily prejudices her right to travel under the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Family Court -- Runaway</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A New York Family Court does not have jurisdiction over an alleged runaway solely on the basis of her dependent status in this State; to subject respondent to the stigma and legal consequences of a PINS adjudication based only on her status in this State as a dependent child would constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife instituted an action against defendant husband for payment of arrears under a contract the parties entered into, which modified alimony and child support provisions of their divorce decree. The wife was granted summary judgment by the district court (New York) and the husband filed a motion to vacate the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband claimed that the court was prohibited from enforcing the alimony decree because the United States Supreme Court had found an alimony statute in Alabama unconstitutional because it used gender as a basis for classification without the necessary exigent circumstances being present. The court stated that N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 236 was construed to afford equal eligibility to both spouses for alimony. Assuming arguendo that the entire section was unconstitutional, the effect of such was prospective only. Accordingly, the court found that the Supreme Court's decision did not bar the enforcement of the husband's alimony obligations. The court did find, however, that N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law &sect; 5-311 did circumscribe the husband's rights to contract concerning his obligation to support his wife and provided an entirely different standard to the wife's contractual rights. Thus, the court held that this was unconstitutional. While the court was of the opinion that &sect; 5-311 was unconstitutional, it did not so hold because the husband had not directly challenged its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 236 of the Domestic Relations Law, which provides for the payment of alimony to the wife in an action for divorce, is repugnant to the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution in that it employs sex as a basis for classification without the necessary exigent circumstances being present; accordingly, section 236 must be rendered gender neutral and construed to afford equal eligibility to both spouses for alimony.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with petit larceny and criminal possession of stolen property arising out of an alleged purse snatching.

Law &sect; 340.40(7), which provided that defendants charged with misdemeanors were not entitled to a jury trial, was unconstitutional. The district attorney sought to prohibit the judge from enforcing his order. Granting the writ, the court held that (1) prohibition was proper where the judge had acted in excess of his power in directing a jury trial in contravention of &sect; 340.40 and where no constitutional right existed; (2) petit larceny was a crime which was malum in se, thus, the common law treatment or nature of offense plus punishment standard applied to determine whether defendant was entitled to a jury trial; (3) applying that test, larceny was a &quot;petty offense&quot;; thus, &sect; 340.40(7) did not violate defendant's right to a jury trial; and (4) defendant had no right to treatment because the State was not seeking to incarcerate defendant for noncriminal acts for the purpose of treatment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against Body or Officer -- Prohibition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The gravity of the harm, alternative remedies, and the magnitude of the problem are factors that a court may consider in determining whether to permit the remedy of prohibition, since that remedy is discretionary, not mandatory.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.

CPL 340.40 (subd 7), which mandates nonjury trials for first-time youthful offenders, is not an unconstitutional violation of the youthful offender's right to a jury trial for the crime of petit larceny, since the nature of the offense is such that a youthful offender adjudication is not a judgment of conviction for a crime, and conviction as a youthful offender is not criminal in nature, thereby permitting the youthful offender proceeding to be summarily conducted, and since the maximum period of incarceration for such a youthful offender is six months, the crime of petit larceny can be classified as a petty offense when committed by such a youthful&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  offender, and, therefore, does not require a jury trial; the fact that such a youthful offender may be placed on probation does not change the offense from petty to serious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Predicate Nature of Youthful Offender Adjudication</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The predicate nature of a conviction of a youthful offender for petit larceny without a jury trial pursuant to CPL 340.40 (subd 7) does not render that statute unconstitutional since such a conviction was constitutionally obtained and may validly serve as a basis for different treatment and/or punishment in a subsequent proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Youthful Offenders -- Right to Treatment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9.  CPL 340.40 (subd 7) does not violate a youthful offender's constitutional right to treatment since that right only applies where the State seeks to incarcerate a person through noncriminal procedures for noncriminal acts for purposes of treatment, and the statute does not have that purpose, but rather is designed to incarcerate a youthful offender for his illegal activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Youthful Offenders</SPAN></P>

The court also held that an essential prerequisite for constitutional protection of a consensual sexual act was that the act be performed in private.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contractor filed an action against defendant public corporation to recover damages for breach of a contract to repair a public bridge. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the contractor. The contractor then filed a post-trial motion to fix the date from which interest was to be computed and to have 1939 N.Y. Laws 585, which limited interest on breach of contract claims against public corporations, declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor argued that the interest limitation of 1939 N.Y. Laws 585 on contract claims was both a denial of its right to equal protection of the law and a taking of its property without just compensation. The court granted the contractor's motion with respect to the date of accrual for purposes of the interest calculation because the appellate court had acknowledged that the date sought by the contractor was the correct date. The court denied the contractor's motion to have 1939 N.Y. Laws 585 declared unconstitutional because the statute did not create an invidious classification, nor did the establishment of the maximum rate of interest on contract claims constitute a taking of the contractor's property. The contractor failed to establish that its constitutionally protected rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses were violated. Any classification created by 1939 N.Y. Laws 585 was not palpably arbitrary and capricious and the distinction for actions for breach of contract served a rational governmental purpose and was therefore immune from attack as a denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Statutory Classifications</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Legislature has wide discretion in fashioning classifications which are reasonably related to a valid object of legislation and the question of constitutional validity disappears when it cannot be said that no state of facts reasonably justifying the classification can be conceived, the burden resting with one who challenges the classification to show that it does not rest upon any reasonable basis but that it is palpably arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Interest -- Contract Claim against Public Corporation -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A statute limiting the interest on breach of contract claims against public corporations to 4% (L 1939, ch 585), while interest&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on condemnation claims is 6%, does not create an irrational distinction that is presumptively arbitrary and capricious since it is within the discretion of the Legislature to set the rate of interest for claims against public corporations; although statutes which differentiate between different classes of owners in condemnation cases and allow differing rates of interest depending on the governmental unit involved deny equal protection, the establishment of the rate of interest for claims against a public corporation insofar as that rate differs from the rate established for condemnation actions could be based upon the reasonable legislative determination that public corporations should have a favorable status under the law and therefore the distinction made between condemnation proceedings and contract actions does serve a rational governmental purpose and is therefore immune from attack as a denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Interest -- Contract Claim against Public Corporation -- Due Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Payment of interest on a breach of a contract claim against a public corporation at the statutory rate of 4% (L 1939, ch 585), rather than at the 6% rate for condemnation cases, does&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not constitute a taking of plaintiff's property in derogation of plaintiff's right of due process since a mere breach of contract neither impairs contractual obligations nor constitutes a taking of property sufficient to satisfy due process and, therefore, not all damages incident to a breach of contract are constitutionally protected; plaintiff's property right is in the compensation for work performed under the contract and not in the interest rate to be paid on the claim and, even assuming that plaintiff's property was taken, the rate of interest established by statute is presumptively reasonable and should be applied by the courts in the absence of evidence sufficient to rebut that presumption.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a motion to suppress physical evidence obtained from the premises of his automobile salvage business, defendant questioned the constitutionality of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police engaged in a warrantless inspection of defendant's junkyard, pursuant to the state vehicle dismantlers law, N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 415-a. Defendant was indicted and charged with several counts. Plaintiff moved to suppress evidence seized by the police during the search. The court concluded that defendant's consent to search was a reluctant acquiescence and submission to authority. Accordingly, the legality of the search and seizure was to stand or fall upon statutory authorization. The court held that the warrantless search of defendant's business premises, under N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 415-a, and the seizure of the allegedly stolen automobile parts found therein, as well as the seizure of a taillight assembly, were legal. Inspection for compliance with the dismantlers law, as an administrative search related to a pervasively regulated industry, posed only a limited threat to defendant's expectations of privacy. Further, the seizure of the taillight was upheld, as it was in plain view and seized incident to an arrest.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. While a search warrant issued upon probable cause is not required when a search is conducted pursuant to consent, the court is required to indulge every reasonable presumption against the waiver of constitutional rights and a prosecutor seeking to rely upon consent to justify the lawfulness of a search has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the consent was unequivocal, voluntary and freely given; accordingly, since defendant's consent to a search of his automobile junkyard by plain-clothes police officers after being advised that a search warrant was not required to inspect his business premises and the records he was required by statute to maintain as a licensed auto dismantler (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 415-a), was merely a reluctant acquiescence and submission to authority, he did not voluntarily consent to the search and the legality of the search and resulting seizure of allegedly stolen automobile parts must stand or fall upon the statutory authorization with the initial burden of going forward to show the legality of the police conduct being&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon the People but the accused shouldering the burden of persuasion to suppress the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A search without a warrant is lawful if incident to a lawful arrest and if it is substantially contemporaneous with the arrest and is confined to the immediate vicinity of the arrest, the lawfulness of the search depending upon the existence of probable cause to arrest; accordingly, since defendant was lawfully arrested based upon an inspection of his automobile junkyard for compliance with statutory record-keeping requirements (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 415-a) just prior to the observation and seizure of a stolen taillight assembly, such assembly, in plain view, could legally be seized as incident to defendant's arrest; when a person engages in such a pervasively regulated business, operable only by licensees, he does so with the knowledge that his business records and inventory will be subject to effective inspection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, an elected school board official and a member of the school district, were charged with obstructing governmental administration and criminal trespass in the District Court of New York, First District, Suffolk County, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 195.05, 140.10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the charge of obstructing governmental administration the defendants allegedly interfered with a school board meeting by recording a session of the board's meeting contrary to a by-law of the school board. Concerning the criminal trespass charge, the defendants allegedly refused to leave the board's meeting upon request to do so. One defendant was an elected member of the school board, and the other defendant was a member of the school district. The court dismissed the charges holding that the recording in contravention of a by-law was not obstructing governmental administration. The practical effect of not allowing the meeting to be recorded would be to oust an elected representative from a school board meeting. The by-law could not be given effect because it would result in a diminution of freedom and a lessening of public confidence. The by-law violated the public policy and principles expressed in N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 95, and the informations based thereon were insufficient as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and the alleged father entered into a long and impassioned love affair from 1971 until 1976. The child at issue was born in 1974. The hospital bills were paid by medical coverage paid for from the alleged father's salary check, which deduction continued for approximately two and one-half years after the birth. Both the alleged father and his mother acknowledged the child as their own daughter and granddaughter. The court entered a finding of paternity, concluding that the alleged father and his family recognized and admitted paternity until the alleged father came to realize that he faced financial responsibilities as a result. The court rejected the alleged father's argument that N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act art. 5 was unconstitutional because it benefitted only women. The court held that art. 5 benefitted children and that proceedings under art. 5 could be brought by both men and women. Finally, the court rejected the argument that it was unconstitutional to require a man to support his children so long as the law did not grant that man an absolute right to require the mother to undergo an abortion.</SPAN></P>

The landowners and the town officials filed the action for declaratory judgment. The court dismissed the complaint and denied plaintiffs' cross-motion.

The court found that legislation was presumed to be constitutional and required proof persuasive beyond a reasonable doubt to find it unconstitutional. The court found that there was no restriction in the statute that was related to the landowners' religious beliefs and that the landowners had failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were individuals charged with patronizing prostitutes in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 230.03. Each defendant moved for dismissal of the charges in the interest of justice pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 170.40. The court noted that the legislature had increased the penalty for the crime and that the prosecutor had adopted a &quot;no plea bargain&quot; policy as efforts to deter this particular crime. The court considered and applied the following factors: (a) nature of the crime; (b) available evidence of guilt; (c) prior record of each defendant; (d) punishment already suffered; (e) purpose and effect of further punishment; (f) prejudice resulting to defendants by the passage of time; and (g) impact on the public interest. Although dismissal was discretionary with the court, the court said that defendants must demonstrate compelling factors to justify dismissal. The court found ample evidence of guilt and no compelling factors in each of these cases. Although the court noted that it was disturbed by the prosecutor's &quot;no plea bargain&quot; policy, it did not find any evidence of discriminatory treatment of defendants on improper grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendants' motions to dismiss the charges against them in the interests of justice because the prosecutor had wide discretion in determining which crimes to prosecute, defendants did not demonstrate any improper discrimination, and defendants failed to show any compelling factors which justified exercise of the court's discretion to dismiss the charges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Factors to be considered in dismissing an information in the interest of justice ( CPL 170.40) are: the nature of the crime; the available evidence of guilt; the prior record of the defendant; the punishment already suffered by the defendant; any prejudice resulting to the defendant by the passage of time; and the impact on the public interest of a dismissal; accordingly, dismissal of misdemeanor charges of patronizing a prostitute (Penal Law, &sect; 230.03) against each defendant for allegedly approaching an undercover policewoman and seeking sexual intercourse, in the interest of justice, is not warranted since defendants' cases are not those which cry out for &quot;fundamental justice beyond the confines of conventional considerations&quot; in light of the legislative &quot;get tough policy&quot; raising the penalties faced by &quot;Johns&quot; in an effort to diminish street prostitution and the fact that defendants have suffered no more than any other defendants accused of misdemeanor offenses and the impact to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  public if dismissal were granted would be adverse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Patronizing Prostitute -- Refusal to Grant Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal or Accept Plea</SPAN></P>

The policy of the District Attorney in not granting adjournments in contemplation of dismissal ( CPL 170.55) as to the crime of patronizing a prostitute (Penal Law, &sect; 230.03) and refusing to allow any defendants charged with such offense to take a plea in an attempt to deter street prostitution by placing increased possibilities of incarceration and penalties against &quot;Johns&quot;, although unnecessarily rigid bordering on harassment, does not, however, constitute unconstitutional discrimination since an accused does not have a fundamental constitutional right to plead to reduced charges and the District Attorney is merely exercising his substantial prosecutorial discretion to determine &quot;whom, whether and how&quot; to prosecute crimes; although the People's intransigent stand is not the solution to the issue of prostitution, the judiciary should not impede an otherwise legitimate prosecutorial policy unless the most compelling circumstances dictate such intervention.  </SPAN></P>

The father appeared at the proposed adoption proceeding and indicated his intention to oppose the adoption and seek custody of his child. The mother then withdrew her proposed surrender for adoption and instead elected to oppose the father's effort to obtain custody by filing her own petition for return of the infant daughter to her custody. The court determined that the mother's actions constituted extraordinary circumstances, thereby invoking the &quot;best interests of the child&quot; test. The court ruled that based on the evidence it was in the best interests of the infant daughter to be in the care and custody of her father. The court found that the mother was not ready to assume parental responsibility, while the father was. The court determined that to hold the unwed mother had a prima facie right to custody over the father denied equal protection of the law to the father and irrationally prevented the court from doing what was best for the infant daughter.</SPAN></P>

Section 70 of the Domestic Relations Law which provides that in &quot;all cases there shall be no prima facie right to custody of the child in either parent&quot; applies to unwed as well as to wed parents since to hold that the unwed mother has a prima facie right to custody over the unwed father would deny equal protection of the law to the father, irrationally prevent the court from doing what is best for the child, and could also do irreparable harm to unwed fathers who might otherwise be encouraged to take an active role in the rearing of their offspring; furthermore, even if such a gender-based distinction between unwed parents is constitutional, any prima facie right to custody is negated where the unwed mother intends to place the child up for adoption and, in such case, her actions constitute extraordinary circumstances, thereby requiring that issue of custody be determined according to the &quot;best interests of the child&quot; without any gender-based distinctions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the relationship between mother and child was biologically established from the point of conception, and that Fam.

The court explained that if there was any disparity evidenced by the application of Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 514, it was mitigated by the fact that the operation of the section was intended to preserve the child's welfare, and any alleged inequity was palliated as a consequence of the limited duration of the father's liability under that section. The court noted that a provision concerning the ability of the father to enter a compromise was unwarranted because a father who wished to voluntarily support his offspring could have done so by either initiating judicial proceedings himself, provided under Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 522, or by entering into a private compact with the mother.

There is no arbitrariness underlying the imposition of the obligation because a finding of paternity is a prerequisite for an award of expenses to the mother, and furthermore, the father's responsibility under section 514 is limited to the term of the mother's confinement and recovery, and upon termination of this period, the dual parental responsibility mandated by section 513 of the Family Court Act reasserts itself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Article 5 of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Family Court Act, paternity proceedings, is not unconstitutional on the ground that no provision is made concerning the father's ability to enter a compromise concerning the support of the mother or child, since section 516 of the Family Court Act, which enables the mother to enter into such a compromise, was initiated as a device to enable a mother to compel the support of her illegitimate child by the natural father, and it would be superfluous and illogical to provide a means for the father to enter such an agreement under section 516 since the entire thrust is toward a recalcitrant parent whose aim would be to avoid support of his dependents; moreover, such a provision is unwarranted since a father who wishes to voluntarily support his offspring may do so by either initiating judicial proceedings himself (Family Ct Act, &sect; 522) or by entering into a private compact with the mother.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Article 5 of the Family Court Act, paternity proceedings, is not unconstitutional on the ground that no provision is made for a mother to pay for a blood-grouping test, although such a provision is made for a father to do so if he is financially able, since the essence of section 532 of the Family Court Act, which provides for blood-grouping tests of principal participants in filiation proceedings, is to afford some measure of protection primarily for the putative father; in a contested paternity proceeding, exclusion of the alleged father certainly benefits him and it is inequitable if a mother is compelled to pay for a test which may defeat her cause of action. Additionally, under section 532 of the Family Court Act the tests may be had on motion of any party, and the party requesting the test bears the expense </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Carol B</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 94 Misc 2d 1015); therefore it is conceivable that a mother would be ordered to pay for blood-grouping tests.</SPAN></P>

Article 5 of the Family Court Act, paternity proceedings, is not unconstitutional in light of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Orr v Orr</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (440 U.S. 268), which held the Alabama alimony statutes unconstitutional since the statutory scheme created a constitutionally suspect classification in that distinctions made therein were gender-based without serving important governmental objectives; article 5 does not place child support obligations solely upon one class of people, nor does it discriminate on the basis of sex, since both parents are held responsible for the support of their child (Family Ct Act, &sect; 513), and additionally, section 561 of the Family Court Act squarely places support obligations upon the mother involved.  The legislative rationale is to secure support for the child, and the purpose of article 5 is to provide a process to help identify the putative father involved so that he may assume his equitable share of the underlying responsibility toward the child; in no way can either the statutory objective or the means provided to accomplish such be labeled violative of basic constitutional guarantees. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was required, as a condition of employment with the city, to sign a statement by which he agreed to pay an amount equivalent to the income tax owed by a resident, should he ever cease to become a resident. The employee had not complied with the requirement and for a time the city did not enforce the obligation, until it threatened the employee with dismissal for failure to file the appropriate tax form. The employee brought an action to prevent the imposition of which he considered to be an illegal tax. The court denied the employee's petition with respect to the enforceability of the contract and his allegations that the payment amounted to an unconstitutional tax. The court granted his petition to the limited extent of protecting the privacy of his state and federal tax returns. The court held that the employee did not have standing to argue the constitutionality of the tax, because he was not a citizen and was not subject to the tax. His complaint related to a contractual provision, which the court ruled was not unconscionable and was enforceable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Although an action challenging the constitutionality of a statute should properly be brought as an action for a declaratory judgment, the court will treat a CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging the constitutionality of a statute as if maintained in the proper form, since all the necessary parties are present, in furtherance of the interests of justice and judicial economy ( CPLR 103, subd [c]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Courts act with extreme caution when asked to determine the constitutionality of a statute, and issues of constitutionality are examined and decided only where raised by one personally aggrieved thereby, and clearly necessary to proper disposition of the litigation before the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioner, an employee of the City of New York who did not reside in the city, and who signed an agreement, as a condition of his employment, pursuant to section 822 of the New York City Charter whereby he agreed to pay the New York City income tax, does not have standing to challenge&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the constitutionality of section 822, since he is not aggrieved by the operation of section 822, but rather by the terms of the contract in which he agreed to comply with the provisions contained in the statute, and petitioner is not subject to or threatened with involuntary and arbitrary enforcement of section 822.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Nature of Tax</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The obligation to pay a tax is not dependent upon a contract, nor can it be assumed by contract; taxes are forced contributions imposed upon citizens to pay the expenses of government, and are in no way related to the will or contract, express or implied, of the persons taxed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Contracts -- Employment Agreement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. An agreement voluntarily signed by petitioner, an employee of the City of New York who did not reside in the city, as a condition of his employment, whereby he agreed, pursuant to section 822 of the New York City Charter, to pay the New York City income tax, is an enforceable contract, is authorized by statute, is not unconscionable, and is not an indirect involuntary tax, since section 822 is a valid exercise of powers granted to every city in New York State and each city has full authority to establish conditions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of employment for its employees (see NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2, subd [c], par [1]; General City Law, &sect; 20).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Contracts -- Employment Agreement -- Enforcement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The only way to enforce an agreement signed by petitioner, an employee of the City of New York who did not reside in the city, whereby he agreed to pay the New York City income tax, absent voluntary compliance with the agreement by petitioner, is by an independent plenary action for breach of contract, in which action the court may order disclosure of petitioner's tax returns, since the agreement cannot properly be enforced without reference to petitioner's Federal and/or State income tax returns, and section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (US Code, tit 26, &sect; 6103) and subdivision (e) of section 697 of the Tax Law prohibit the disclosure of Federal and State tax returns and the particulars thereof, except as specifically authorized by law.  Although there is no proof that respondents, certain officials of the City of New York and the city, have or are about to obtain petitioner's tax returns without benefit of court order in a separate plenary action, this possibility is not expressly denied by respondents, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and, accordingly, the petition, which seeks to prohibit respondents from enforcing the agreement and to prohibit them from seeking any information concerning petitioner's tax returns for the purpose of enforcing the agreement, is granted to the extent of permanently enjoining respondents from so proceeding in excess of their jurisdiction and authority ( CPLR 7803, subd 2).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff cabaret operators filed three actions against defendant city and sought to have an ordinance, New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; B32-297.1, which regulated the operation of adult cabarets, declared unconstitutional. The cabaret operators filed motions for preliminary injunctions to prevent the city from enforcing the ordinance and the city filed cross motions to dismiss the actions for lack of standing and the failure to state a claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that the cabaret operator's lacked the requisite standing to challenge &sect; B32-297.1 because they had not applied for licenses under the ordinance. Further, the city argued that the cabaret operators had failed to state a cause of action. The court disagreed and held that the cabaret operators had stated a proper cause of action and that they had standing to challenge the ordinance because they faced criminal prosecution for failing to obtain the licenses required under the ordinance. The court further held that the ordinance was unconstitutional on the following grounds: it invalidly acted as a prior restraint; it vested excessive discretionary power in the commissioner of consumer affairs of the city in the issuance and renewal of cabaret licenses upon grounds that were impermissible and overly broad; and its disclosure requirements were violative of the right to freedom of association and anonymity. Accordingly, the cabaret operator's motions for preliminary injunctions were granted and the city's motions to dismiss were denied.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs, lessees and operators of cabaret premises facing criminal charges for operating their cabarets without licenses (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; B32-297.1), have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the licensing ordinance even though they have not applied for cabaret licenses since parties faced by an unconstitutional licensing law are not required to show that their conduct could be regulated by a properly drawn law or that the deterrent effect of the law on their First Amendment rights is both real and substantial in order to challenge or resist the validity of the ordinance or statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1978 N.Y. Laws ch. 481 made 13, 14, and 15 year-olds criminally responsible for certain enumerated felonies.

The proper means of analysis is the rational basis test, and since the Legislature did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in establishing the juvenile offender category, there are ameliorative provisions to protect the 13-, 14- or 15-year-old defendant, all the basic rights available to adult offenders are possessed by the juvenile in this category, and there is a rational basis of protection of public safety and deterrence of crime, the discrepancies in treatment between 13-, 14-, and 15-year-old defendants and 16-, 17-, and 18-year-old defendants do not amount to denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The wife died on September 28, 1978. Notice of her death was given to the bank on September 29, 1978. The trust was withdrawn from the common trust fund as of a November valuation date. The remaindermen sought to fix September 29, 1978 as the date of withdrawal. In granting the bank's motion for summary judgment, the court ruled that under &sect; 100-c(6) and N.Y. Comp.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile who was 15 years of age at the time of commission of an alleged crime, sought to set aside the sentence imposed on him on the ground that the controlling statute was violative of his rights under the equal protection and due process clauses of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed the juvenile youthful offender statute under which defendant was sentenced. The court noted that the provisions of such statute drew a distinction based solely on the date of birth of the juvenile defendant and stripped out of the court the discretion to grant youthful offender treatment to juveniles even in cases where the &quot;ends of justice&quot; would best be served by allowing such treatment. The court found that the statute was unconstitutional in compelling a court to impose a more severe penalty on a 14 or 15-year-old juvenile offender compared to a penalty imposed on his 16 to 19-year-old counterpart. Moreover, the court found no rational basis for discrimination against, and heavier penalties for, those in a lower-age group as penalties should be less severe for those in the &quot;tender years.&quot; Thus, the court held that defendant, who was 15 years of age at time of commission of the crime, was denied due process and equal protection by the stringent provisions of the juvenile offender statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new statutory scheme for &quot;juvenile offenders&quot; (L 1978, ch 481), which imposes a more severe penalty on a 14- or 15-year-old &quot;juvenile offender&quot; than one afforded to his 16- to 19-year-old counterpart, stripping the courts of discretion to grant youthful offender treatment to a juvenile even in those cases where the ends of justice would best be served by allowing such treatment, is violative of equal protection under the strict scrutiny test for a &quot;suspect&quot; classification or fundamental right which requires that the legislative purpose for the disparity of treatment be so compelling as to justify the means utilized, since there is no legislative policy which would afford beneficient youthful offender treatment to a 16- to 19-year-old offender while denying same to a 14 or 15 year old; even applying a rational basis standard, the classification must nevertheless fall since there is no rational basis for treating youths under the age of 16 more severely than their 16- to 19-year-old brethren.  </SPAN></P>

The court granted the motion to dismiss. The court held that the legislation in question did not impose punishment of a kind found in an unconstitutional bill of attainder and the legislature properly delegated authority.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The library was a non-public, free association library which, pursuant to a contract, provided library services to the school district residents pursuant to N.Y.

Law &sect; 101 in that the library failed to request separate bids for plumbing, gas, heating, air conditioning, and electrical wiring. The court denied the taxpayer's application and held that the library was not one of the specified entities controlled by the mandate of &sect; 101. The court found that the library owned the land, would own the addition to the land, would completely control the construction and payments therefor, and would end up owning and controlling everything. Because the matter did not involve a lease with the school district, the court found that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 1726 could not be construed to require respondents to comply with &sect; 101. The court also held that the fact that the library was supported by taxes by way of a contract with the school district was irrelevant to whether the library was a political entity bound by &sect; 101.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child's mother left her with petitioner and never returned. Petitioner was named guardian and later sought a private placement adoption. Being indigent, petitioner applied for the city to pay the cost of service by publication on the natural mother to complete jurisdiction. The court denied the application. On petitioner's motion for reargument, the court granted reargument and affirmed its decision to deny the application. The court found that petitioner had an alternate means of adopting the child through the department of human services (department) and, thus, was not deprived of access to the courts by her inability to pay the costs. The court distinguished cases from other states that allowed payment of costs where there was no other way to achieve an adoption. The court ruled that, although petitioner preferred a private proceeding, she could surrender custody of the abandoned child to the department for it to conduct a public adoption proceeding. The court concluded that the possibility that the department might decide it was in the child's best interest for someone else to adopt her did not give petitioner a constitutional right to the city's payment of her costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband relied on the Orr decision of the United States Supreme Court as a bar to the enforcement of the alimony order since a literal reading of N.Y.

The alimony order at issue here was granted prior to the Orr decision. The court granted leave to the wife to enter judgment and have execution for a particular sum. The court held that the Orr decision should not be given retroactive effect. The court further utilized the principle authorizing it to construe the statute so as to avoid an unconstitutional interpretation. No violence was done to either the purpose or intent of the statute with respect to the award of temporary alimony in appropriate matrimonial actions by construing and interpreting the statute so as to equalize the eligibility of a spouse, irrespective of sex or gender, to the benefits thereof. The court so construed &sect; 236.</SPAN></P>

A show cause order was issued, and for &quot;hearing&quot; purposes, the court consolidated the superintendent's application with the bank's application for injunctive relief. The court held that the bank was not entitled to injunctive relief and confirmed the superintendent's actions. The court concluded that under &sect; 612 the statement and certificate were regarded as presumptive evidence of the facts stated therein. The court merely had the right to review the superintendent's act of &quot;taking possession&quot; from the judicially limited perspective of whether she acted arbitrarily, capriciously, without good cause, and or whether there had been an abuse of her discretionary prerogative. The court determined that &sect; 606 of the Banking Law did not require a finding of &quot;insolvency&quot; before permitting the &quot;taking possession.&quot; The court held that the merger was in the best interests of the public welfare and the interests of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fugitive brought a petition for habeas corpus to prevent extradition to Alabama on an indictment charging him with securities fraud under Ala. Code &sect; 8-6-17. The indictment did not contain any date for the commission of the alleged offense. He asserted that the indictment was deficient without a date because it prevented him from resisting extradition on the ground that he was not in the demanding state. He also asserted that the acts alleged were not a crime in Alabama. The trial court denied the petition. It held that the requirements of N.Y.C.P.L.R. 570.08, 570.18 were satisfied because the date of the alleged offense was supplied by the demanding state in another official document. The court held that establishing that the alleged acts were not a crime depended on showing that: (1) statutes or decisional law of Alabama did not establish the act as criminal; or (2) making the act alleged criminal would violate the Constitution of the United States. It ruled that the count alleging disclaimer of a civil debt was not a crime, but that the remaining two counts were crimes.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Although a reasonably specific date of the alleged commission of the crime is essential for the demanding State to successfully extradite a fugitive from an asylum State so that the fugitive can contest his rendition by claiming he was not present in the demanding State at the time of the alleged crime, it is not essential that the date be in the indictment, rather the date may be supplied in any official document of the demanding State to effectuate the purpose of extradition proceedings; accordingly, the failure of an indictment to supply a date of the alleged crime in an extradition proceeding does not warrant the discharge of the alleged fugitive if the date is supplied by the demanding State in another official document such as a sworn &quot;application for extradition&quot; by the prosecutor of the demanding State.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Extradition -- Scope of Judicial Review -- Inquiry Whether Acts Constitute Crime</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The courts of an asylum State, in an extradition proceeding, have the power and obligation to inquire as to whether the acts of which the alleged fugitive is accused constitute a crime; CPL 570.08, which requires that the demanding State &quot;substantially charge&quot; the person demanded with a crime, requires that the accused be advised of the specific acts constituting the crime alleged and, if the penal statute itself is vague, the accusatory instrument must describe the offense in greater detail.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured infant was hurt while operating a tractor on a road in the town. His father commenced an action against the town claiming damages resulting from negligent construction and maintenance of the road, shoulders, and drainage system, and appurtenances thereto. The father filed a motion for an order dismissing a second affirmative defense of the town on the ground that the local law on which the defense was based was unconstitutional. The court granted the motion. The court held that a comparison of the relevant provisions of N.Y. Town Law &sect; 65-a and N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 50-e with Ghent, N.Y., Local Law No. 1 showed that different requirements concerning the prior service of a written notice of unsafe condition were set forth. The local law additionally required notices of the unsafe condition of any other property owned by the town. The local enactment was thus inconsistent with the General Law because it prohibited that which was found acceptable under the General Law. To the extent that Local Law No. 1 of the town required additional requirements of the prior service of a written notice of unsafe conditions, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the adult daughters of a couple killed in an automobile accident, filed a motion to amend their complaint to assert a wrongful death cause of action claiming punitive damages and seeking additional discovery of defendant automobile manufacturer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' parents were burned to death when their automobile was involved in a collision and caught fire. Plaintiffs brought suit against defendants, the manufacturer, retailer, and repairer of their parents' vehicle and the driver of the other vehicle involved in the collision. Plaintiffs filed a motion to amend their complaint to assert a wrongful death cause of action, claiming punitive damages and seeking additional discovery of defendant automobile manufacturer. The court noted that New York's wrongful death statute did not deny punitive damages but that judicial precedent disallowed any award of punitive damages in a wrongful death cause of action. The court applied the middle tier scrutiny test to analyze whether the preferential treatment of tort-feasors whose negligence resulted in death compared to tort-feasors whose negligence injured their victims could withstand an equal protection challenge. The court held that the preferential treatment did not further any legitimate articulated governmental purpose and had obvious detrimental effects which outweighed its benefits. The court granted plaintiff's requested amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted permission to plaintiffs to amend their complaint to include a wrongful death cause of action and to claim punitive damages against defendants.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York wrongful death statute ( EPTL 5-4.3), which limits damages to the fair and just compensation for the pecuniary injuries resulting from the decedent's death to persons for whose benefit the action is brought, does not abrogate the plaintiff executrix' right to seek punitive damages from the defendant car manufacturer, in a wrongful death action commenced after plaintiff's parents were killed in an automobile accident; alternatively, insofar as the wording, application and interpretation of New York's wrongful death statute deny the recovery of punitive damages in a wrongful death case, while they are permitted in personal injury and property damage cases in New York, they are violative of the equal protection of laws as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and section 11 of article I of the New York Constitution.

He applied to the court for dismissal of the information on the ground that &sect; 58-2 violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8, 11. The court agreed that by singling out gas stations for proscription of price signs, other than those affixed to gas pumps, the town created an arbitrary classification. The court found that the ordinance improperly singled out speech of a particular content, i.e., gasoline prices, and while not preventing its dissemination completely, there was left open no ample alternative channel of communication, as reflected by the drastic reduction in sales when this means of advertisement was foreclosed. The court observed that the frustrated gasoline consumer had a right to know that there was a dealer whose product was being sold at a discount price within the town.</SPAN></P>

The landlord failed to meet the heavy burden imposed on a party seeking to overcome the strong presumption of constitutionality inherent in every statute enacted by the legislature.

The court denied petitioner's application to quash the subpoena or to modify it. The court concluded that N.Y. Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of New York and the City of New York City sought to judicially settle the priority of their tax claims against the executor of an insolvent estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An insolvent estate owed the State unpaid income taxes and owed the City unpaid income and unincorporated business taxes. The State and the City sought to determine the priority of their respective tax claims. The State asserted that it had priority on its entire claim, but the City asserted that its tax claims were on a parity. The court noted that the City's income and business taxes were a means of balancing the budget for the costs of local government. Unlike emergency relief taxes, the revenues from the City's business and income taxes were not held separately. Further, if income taxes were a delegation of the authority to tax a subdivision of the State such tax might be an unconstitutional unequal state tax because all municipal residents were to be treated equally. Thus, the City's income tax was not a delegation of authority for the State's revenues, and the City was not collecting the funds in question as an agent of the State. Moreover, under N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc. Act Law &sect; 1811(2)(a), a fiduciary had to first pay debts entitled to a preference under the law of the United States and the State of New York. Thus, the State enjoyed priority over the City for the tax debts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the State enjoyed priority over the City for the tax debts, irrespective of when the claims were filed. Nevertheless, the City was not in parity with all other creditors, but had a priority as against them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the sovereign right of the State to priority for its taxes may not be restricted or abridged without a specific statutory provision and since SCPA 1811, which requires a fiduciary to first pay debts &quot;entitled to preference under the laws of the United States and the state of New York&quot; does not include &quot;debts of any subdivision of the state&quot; or similar language, the State's claim for unpaid income taxes against the insolvent estate is entitled to priority over the claim by the City of New York for unpaid income taxes and unincorporated business taxes; the right of the city to impose an income tax (General City Law, &sect; 25-a) is not a &quot;delegation of the State's authority&quot; to tax so as to give the city an equal priority with the State for unpaid income taxes but is instead a way for the city to collect its costs of local government and consequently the city is collecting the funds for its own purposes and not as an agent of the State.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother filed an application for letters of administration in decedent's estate and was the guardian of the property of an infant who was the out-of-wedlock son of the mother and the decedent. The question presented was whether under the facts here present, the mother's ward had the status of a distributee of the decedent's estate so as to confer upon the mother her right as his guardian to letters of administration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the infant was born his parents were living together. It appears that they continued to cohabit for many years thereafter. After the parents separated, an order of filiation and support was entered in the family court against the decedent. On the date of the order the infant was approximately eight years of age. Thereafter the decedent regularly made the ordered support payments, visited with his son, purchased clothing for him, gave him gifts, opened a small bank account for his benefit, and named him as a beneficiary on a life insurance policy. He died and the mother of the child filed her petition. The court granted the petition. Although N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law 4-1.2(a)(2) provided for legitimacy if the order of filiation was instituted within two years from the birth of the child, the court followed the consistent pattern of the courts of New York of allowing an illegitimate, whose relationship to his father had been established by a filiation order, to inherit from his father no matter how long after birth the filiation order was entered, so long as it was entered during the lifetime of the father.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the mother's application for letters of administration upon her duly qualifying according to law.

The court granted plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court held that although amendments deleted provisions of the laws that plaintiffs contended were unconstitutional, the action was not rendered moot because plaintiffs were still subject to criminal and abuse and neglect charges. Plaintiffs were entitled to an injunction because they showed a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of their claim as the statute appeared to contain an unconstitutional and improper abuse of the police power by completely prohibiting performances by children instead of reasonably regulating them, and apparently unconstitutionally delegated authority to the SPCC.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For over 40 years, the village charged employees of its water and light department the minimum permitted amount for water rent regardless of the amount of water consumed. Later, the same practice was followed with respect to sewer charges. When the practice was discontinued by village officials, the employees protested, alleging that the discontinuance violated their collective bargaining agreement. They sought arbitration of the matter, and the village filed a motion to stay. The court found that the agreement clearly established that any grievance, controversy, or dispute involving the application, meaning, or interpretation of the agreement could proceed to arbitration. The court held that the continuance of the practice offended public policy because the free rentals were nothing more or less than a gift by the municipality to its employees, which was prohibited by N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The court also held that arbitration should proceed to determine whether the free rentals for were a protected benefit and, if they were so protected, that the arbitrator should grant only such relief as was consistent with the legal and constitutional prerogatives of the village.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under a collective bargaining agreement which provides that &quot;any grievance, controversy or dispute&quot; involving &quot;the application, meaning or interpretation&quot; of the agreement may proceed to arbitration, a dispute as to whether discontinuance of &quot;past practices&quot; of the employer village, which charged employees of the village water and light department who resided in the village only the minimum charge permitted for water and sewer rent regardless of the amount consumed, violates an article of said collective bargaining agreement between the parties dealing with maintenance of benefits, is an arbitrable matter; moreover, a clause in the agreement reserving management rights to the village is not a bar to arbitration of said dispute, since the question of whether the minimum charge for water and sewer rent is a protected benefit to employees or a management prerogative is a question of contract interpretation to be resolved by arbitration.</SPAN></P>

A practice by a village in charging employees of the village water and light department who live in the village&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  only the minimum charge permitted for water and sewer rent regardless of the amount of water consumed does not contravene statutory provisions contained in section 11-1118 of the Village Law or section 452 of the General Municipal Law, since those statutes speak only to the obligation of the village to establish and charge equal rental charges to consumers as consumers and do not address the question of whether reduced rentals may be a proper means of compensation to municipal employees; however, where the free water and sewer rentals are not treated as compensation either by the village or the employee, such rentals are a gift by the municipality to its employees in violation of the provisions of section 1 of article VIII of the New York State Constitution. Accordingly, where said practice is the subject of an arbitrable dispute concerning whether it is a past practice protected under the department employees' collective bargaining agreement with the village, arbitration should proceed to determine first, whether the free rental for water and sewer services is a protected benefit under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement and, in the event that it is determined to be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such, and only in that event, the arbitrator should proceed to grant only such relief as is consistent with the legal and constitutional prerogatives of the village; labor arbitrators, even in the public sector, are not strictly limited to remedies requested by the parties, but, on the contrary, arbitrators in this context are, in the final analysis, empowered to do justice and the award may well reflect the spirit, rather than the letter of the agreement.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with criminal possession of marihuana, which was found on a large sailboat of foreign registry manned by defendants and travelling within territorial waters of the United States. Defendants moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis that the vessel was in distress and seeking safe harbor at the time that the drugs were seized. Defendants also urged that the warrantless search violated their rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and 14 U.S.C.S. &sect; 89(a). The court denied defendants' motion, holding that defendants were entitled to assert the defense of safe harbor during a jury trial. The court concluded that the Coast Guard could act as customs officers under &sect; 89(a) and conduct a warrantless customs search, due to observations that defendants' boat was moving without sufficient lights and was riding heavy in the water. The court determined that the subsequent discovery of an odor typical of marihuana and the observations of the drugs in plain view justified a seizure and arrest.

Title 14 (&sect; 89, subd [a]) of the United States Code, which empowers the Coast Guard to make warrantless safety and document inspections of a vessel so long as there is some articulable basis for that inspection, is constitutional since the warrantless boarding of a vessel entering United States waters to ensure compliance with customs laws, safety standards and antismuggling statutes is reasonable in view of the mobility of a vessel, the public interest in its contents when moving from foreign waters into United States jurisdictional waters and the interests of safe navigation; accordingly, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  observations by the Coast Guard that defendants' large sailboat was moving under power and sail at night without green starboard or masthead lights and with an extremely dim stern light, coupled with the fact that the vessel was &quot;riding heavy&quot; in the water, justified the warrantless boarding and once on board, the discovery of the strong odor typical of marihuana and the observations of the contraband in &quot;plain view&quot; justified the seizure and arrest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  CPL 180.75 (subd 4, par [b]), which denies a juvenile offender charged with an armed felony the right to have the criminal action removed from the criminal court to the Family Court &quot;in the interests of justice&quot; unless the District Attorney consents to removal, is not violative of due process or equal protection since juvenile offenders are afforded the full panoply of due process rights possessed by adult criminal defendants and can only be incarcerated in separated facilities that provide special &quot;services&quot; to juvenile offenders ( CPL 510.15; Executive Law, &sect; 515-b); a decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the judicial determination as to whether a juvenile shall be charged and adjudicated in juvenile court or in the adult system is a &quot;critical stage&quot; in the proceedings entitling the juvenile to due process protection where the right to be treated as a juvenile is granted by statute (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Kent v United States</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 383 U.S. 541) is inapplicable to New York's statutory scheme&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under which the determination of original jurisdiction is a legislative rather than a judicial one and, since there is no constitutional right to juvenile treatment, the removal provisions are a matter of legislative grace and, thus, an &quot;in the interests of justice&quot; judicial removal is not constitutionally mandated; a decision of the Court of Appeals invalidating a statute making youthful offender treatment after conviction dependent upon the seriousness of the crime originally charged rather than on the crime for which the juvenile was convicted (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People v Drummond</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 40 NY2d 990) is likewise inapplicable since the juvenile offender, although initially charged with an armed felony, is not forever foreclosed from having his case removed to the Family Court and being treated as a juvenile and, thus, &quot;mere allegations&quot; cannot determine whether the juvenile will ultimately be placed under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Violent Juvenile Offender -- Removal to Family Court on Consent of Prosecutor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The prosecutor's power to condition removal of an &quot;armed felony&quot; charge against a juvenile offender from the criminal court to the Family Court on his consent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ( CPL 180.75, subd 4, par [b]) does not constitute an infringement upon and a usurpation of the court's power to hold an &quot;in the interests of justice&quot; removal hearing where the defendant is charged with an armed felony since the prosecutor possesses the discretionary power to determine whether an offender should be prosecuted as a juvenile or as an adult and, thus, the prosecutor's power to deprive the juvenile court of jurisdiction in the first instance through the use of his charging discretion without holding a hearing is consonant with due process; the consent decision is but another of the prosecutor's widely recognized powers and need not be preceded by a hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Violent Juvenile Offender -- Removal to Family Court on Consent of Prosecutor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since the removal provision of CPL 180.75 (subd 4, par [b]), which denies a juvenile offender charged with an &quot;armed felony&quot; the right to have his case removed from the criminal court to the Family Court &quot;in the interests of justice&quot; without the consent of the District Attorney, is not a &quot;fundamental interest&quot; for equal protection purposes, the defendant only being deprived of his liberty if found guilty of a crime&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for which he is criminally responsible, and removal is a privilege and a matter of legislative grace in any event, the standard of reviewing the constitutionality of the statute under the equal protection clause is the &quot;rational relationship&quot; rather than the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; test and since the rationale behind the legislative action in distinguishing crimes involving both operable and inoperable guns from crimes involving other types of weapons is reasonable and appropriate, reflecting the rational belief that armed felonies are inherently more threatening to society and, accordingly, require a more significant response, the statute, which carries the strong presumption that the Legislature has found facts indicating a need for the enactment, is constitutional; because of &quot;overcharging&quot; by prosecutors, the Legislature should study the new law more thoroughly and amend it so as to insure that only those who commit truly serious crimes are initially treated as adults in the criminal courts.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the inmate was a resident of a correctional facility the facility's superintendent applied for the inmate's readmission to a psychiatric hospital on an emergency basis pursuant to the newly enacted N.Y.

Thereafter, the inmate applied for a writ of habeas corpus under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 70, challenging the constitutionality of N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 402(9). The court held that where immediate action was necessary for the protection of others, be they fellow inmates or correction officers, or for the welfare of the allegedly mentally ill inmate himself, due process did not require notice or hearing as a condition precedent to valid temporary transfer of the inmate to a psychiatric hospital. However, the inmate had to be afforded substantially the same procedural safeguards as those afforded in civil commitment proceedings. An inmate, unlike a citizen, was not deprived of his freedom in a significant way by transfer to a hospital. Accordingly, &sect; 402(9) did not violate due process guarantees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the crime of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, a class D felony. The district attorney requested that defendant be sentenced as a persistent felony offender under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.10 and N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 400.20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant opposed being sentenced as a persistent felon. He claimed that one of his previous convictions was constitutionally infirm. However, the court found that defendant offered no evidence that defeated the presumption of regularity or that upheld a claim of deprivation of due process. The court held that the requirement of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.10(1), that a persistent felony offender was a person who stood convicted of a felony after having been previously convicted of two or more felonies, and the requirement of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 400.20(6) that the convictions were constitutionally obtained, had been satisfied. The court also found that defendant's history and character warranted the conclusion that he was a confirmed criminal and that an extended incarceration and lifetime supervision of defendant was in the public's best interest. The court rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 400.20 was unconstitutional and determined that defendant's due process rights were not violated. Because there was no question that by legally sufficient proof beyond a reasonable doubt defendant was a persistent felony the court sentenced him accordingly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Two prior felony convictions, including a 1960 conviction when defendant was 17 years old and thus eligible for youthful offender treatment, coupled with defendant's long history of violent criminal behavior, authorize sentencing him as a persistent felony offender to extended incarceration and lifetime supervision (Penal Law, &sect; 70.10); the fact that defendant was eligible for, but did not receive youthful offender treatment, does not render his 1960 felony conviction constitutionally infirm ( CPL 400.20) since mere eligibility for youthful offender treatment does not mandate that it be given, and, in the absence of any evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity in court proceedings, a lack of adequate representation by counsel or a lack of due process based on a silent record cannot be assumed; since defendant had received youthful offender treatment in 1958 after a conviction for assault and possession of a weapon, it is as reasonable to suppose that this was in the sentencing Judge's mind as it is to surmise that the Judge did not consider the possibility of sentencing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant as a youthful offender.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  CPL 400.20, which provides for a separate hearing before a defendant may be sentenced as a persistent felony offender (Penal Law, &sect; 70.10), on its face, complies with procedural due process requirements by affording a defendant an opportunity to be heard, to be confronted with witnesses against him and the right to cross-examine and offer evidence of his own (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Specht v Patterson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 386 U.S. 605); accordingly, whether the proper constitutional standard of proof of a defendant's history and criminal character under a recidivist statute should be &quot;clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence&quot; or a &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; as required by CPL 400.20, defendant's previous felony convictions, indicating a 20-year involvement with violence and weapons, justify sentencing him as a persistent felony offender to extended incarceration and lifetime supervision and the fact that 20-year-old convictions were considered in determining defendant's history and criminal character does not violate due process since it is defendant's long and unbroken history of violence that forms the basis of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the persistent felony offender finding.  </SPAN></P>

The landlords' association also filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance created a commission to collect money from rent and to hold it for emergency situations involving rental units. If payment was not made, an application was made to a city court for the appointment of a receiver. The court granted the motion for summary judgment by the landlords' association. The court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional in part because it conflicted with state law. N.Y. Real Prop. Acts Law &sect; 769 created a proceeding for emergency situations of tenants. Thus, the local ordinance was preempted. Further, the appointment of receivers was beyond the jurisdiction of a city court because such appointments were prohibited by the Uniformed City Court Act. Moreover, the ordinance allowed the commission to designate representatives without qualification, which was the unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to a private party. Further still, the ordinance violated due process by giving the commission the power to appoint a receiver without notice and a hearing. Finally, the law created a type of strict liability by assuming that a landlord was a violator before he even collected rent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Law 3-1978 of the City of Yonkers, creating a multiple dwelling commission empowered to collect money from multiple dwelling owners and to hold that money in case an emergency condition arises in the future is unconstitutional in violation of article IX (&sect; 2, subd [c]) of the New York Constitution, which prohibits a municipality from enacting legislation which is inconsistent with State legislation, and such legislation has in fact been enacted in the form of article 7-A of the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law, which provides for a special proceeding by tenants of multiple dwellings directing the deposit of rents into court to be used to remedy conditions dangerous to life, health or safety.  Aside from being pre-empted, the statute unconstitutionally permits an abdication of legislative power to a private party in that no qualifications are specified for the designees of the commission who are to carry out the duties of inspection; the provision for the appointment of receivers by the city court imposes an obligation beyond the court's jurisdiction, and, further, the local law denies to owners their right to procedural&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  due process by determining the amount due without affording the owner an opportunity to be heard.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff proprietors filed an action against defendants, a town, its town board, and others, seeking a declaration to declare unconstitutional a two-attendant ordinance that was passed by the board and seeking a permanent injunction to enjoin defendants from enforcing said ordinance. Defendants had passed an ordinance requiring two attendants to be on duty at self-service stations during working hours.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city's town board passed an ordinance that required two attendants to be on duty at self-service gas stations. The &quot;primary&quot; function of one of the attendants was to supervise, to observe, and to control the dispensing of gasoline. Certain proprietors sought a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was passed illegally, it was an unreasonable regulation passed for improper reasons, and it deprived them of property without due process of law, and sought to enjoin its enforcement. The court held that: (1) the colloquy between the town board and a person, who attended a public hearing before the ordinance was passed and who had spoken in favor of the ordinance, was merely an informal and an un-scheduled discussion, and thus no notice was required to be afforded to the proprietors as to when such discussion would resume; (2) the ordinance, which had fire prevention and fire safety as its purpose, was within the powers delegated to the town board under N.Y. Town Law &sect; 130(15) because it was passed to promote the &quot;public welfare;&quot; and (3) the ordinance was unreasonable because the &quot;manifest evil&quot; apprehended by the town board was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Where a town board, at a public hearing, tabled the discussion of an ordinance which plaintiffs opposed, and permitted a person to speak out in favor of the ordinance at a later meeting, this was merely an informal and unscheduled discussion and no notice was required to be afforded the plaintiffs; although the wisdom of this practice by the board is questionable, it would not be sufficient, standing alone, to invalidate the subsequent passage of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Ordinances</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A validly passed legislative enactment is presumed constitutional and this presumption can only be rebutted by proof of unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt, but, to withstand judicial scrutiny, a municipality's ordinance must be within the ambit of the powers delegated by the Legislature to promote the public welfare, which include the health, safety, morals or general welfare&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the community (Town Law, &sect; 130, subd 15), and must not be arbitrary; rather, it must be reasonably related to some manifest evil which, however, need only be reasonably apprehended. Accordingly, although an ordinance which has fire prevention and fire safety as its purpose is clearly within this broad legislative grant, a town ordinance which requires two attendants to be on duty at self-service gasoline stations during working hours is unconstitutional where no danger has been demonstrated and there has been no showing of how a second attendant would accomplish the desired ends, since, while a municipality need not wait until a disaster occurs before curing a dangerous condition, the exercise of police power should not be extended beyond the evil sought to be curbed.  </SPAN></P>

The court determined that the record contained ample testimony and other proof that self-service dispensing incorporated those devices, systems, and mechanisms, both required and optionally added, sufficient to safeguard the user from the obvious perils which could arise from both the normal filling procedure and detected misuse. The court also determined, however, that it was precisely because of human and mechanical imperfection that public protection had been imposed.

Defendants, who were accorded mandatory youthful offender status, sought a declaration that &sect; 340.40(7) was unconstitutional because it deprived them of a jury trial unless they waived the right to benefits conferred by mandatory youthful offender treatment and on equal protection grounds.

CPL 340.40 (subd 7), which requires nonjury trial by a single Judge for a defendant who is accorded mandatory youthful offender status in a local criminal court proceeding, does not violate the defendant's right to a jury trial in all criminal cases since the maximum period of incarceration after a mandatory youthful offender adjudication is six months (Penal Law, &sect; 60.02, subd [b]), which limitation fully complies with the pronouncement of the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Baldwin v New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (399 U.S. 66), wherein it was held that offenses punishable by a maximum of six months' imprisonment were &quot;petty&quot; and thus did not fall within the ambit of the guarantee of a jury trial in all criminal cases under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution; the fact that defendants may be placed on probation for a term longer than six months does not change this, since traditionally probation can be and often is of a longer duration than the prescribed period of incarceration for the crime, and the sentencing Judge is limited to six months' incarceration of the mandatory youthful offender whether the sentence is meted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  out directly after conviction or plea of guilty or after a violation of the terms of probation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Youthful Offenders -- Equal Protection of Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The difference in the type of trial and the sentence afforded a mandatory and discretionary youthful offender is a valid classification by the Legislature which denies the mandatory youthful offender a jury trial but gives him a &quot;first chance&quot; before a single Judge with a six-month limitation on the sentence that Judge may impose, which sentence limitation is not afforded to a discretionary youthful offender who is permitted a jury trial. Accordingly, these differences do not violate the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

The court found that the statute was neither vague nor unconstitutional, noting that, in addition to the plain meaning of the statute, defendant received actual notice of his rights and duties as a witness and that he was further advised that his immunity did not extend to prosecution for perjury or contempt. The court also found that defendant acted willfully and that his intentional refusal to give responsive answers had a foreseeable obstructive effect on the grand jury process.

The criminal contempt statute (Penal Law, &sect; 215.51), which provides that a &quot;person is guilty of criminal contempt in the first degree * * * when after having been sworn as a witness before a grand jury, he refuses to answer any legal and proper interrogatory&quot;, is constitutionally specific, provides fair notice and intelligible standards as applied to evasive contempt by an immunized Grand Jury witness who gives evasive testimony that is either patently frivolous or &quot;so plainly inconsistent, so manifestly contradictory and so conspicuously unbelievable&quot; as to make it apparent that the witness has deliberately concealed the truth and has given answers which are replies in form only; the responses alleged to be evasive must be examined in light of the questions asked, so that the witness is not held criminally liable for his interrogator's imprecision or confusion and the questions must be relevant to the scope of the Grand Jury's investigation and &quot;free from ambiguity&quot; and so plain as to call either for a direct answer or a refusal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to answer on grounds of privilege; the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">mens rea</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> element of testimonial criminal contempt is the intentional violation of the duty to answer and no proof is required of a specific intent to obstruct justice, the witness who refuses to testify without articulating a reason or asserting a legal basis for refusing to answer being assumed to have acted deliberately and not out of misapprehension of his legal rights.</SPAN></P>

The ex-wife was not domiciled in the state as required by N.Y.C.P.L.R. &sect; 313 and N.Y.C.P.L.R. &sect; 302 was not applicable because the ex-wife was not a resident of the state at the beginning of the divorce action.

Although prior law did not permit direct and immediate placement in a secure facility (except on an emergency basis), unless the act committed was a designated felony and a disposition for restrictive placement was made, without a separate hearing before a Division for Youth Hearing Examiner within seven business days of the placement, the amendment does not have an unconstitutional ex post facto effect, since the Legislature has merely provided the additional forum of the Family Court to avoid duplication of efforts by the court and the hearing officer, without changing the standards or increasing the punishment; the amendment does not take away the right to a direct admission hearing, nor does it take the ultimate decision on whether the juvenile should be sent initially to a secure facility from the Division for Youth, since the court's order pursuant to section 756 does not mandate that the division follow such authorized order.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant asserted that he had been granted transactional and use immunity by a U.S. Attorney in return for his testimony before the Knapp Commission on police corruption. He claimed that the entire prosecution was barred under transactional immunity as a product of his commission testimony, and under use immunity because the prosecution improperly used evidence obtained as a result of his testimony.

The court denied defendant's motion. The court doubted that immunity had in fact been granted, in light of the fact that it hadn't been raised previously, but held that in any event, immunity was a defense N.Y. Crim. Proc.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

Accordingly, a defendant's claim of immunity from State prosecution based upon an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  alleged grant of transactional immunity by a United States Attorney must be rejected where the Federal immunity statute in effect at the time of the supposed agreement permitted a United States Attorney to grant only use or testimonial immunity, not transactional immunity (US Code, tit 18, &sect;&sect; 6002, 6003); nor is anything more required by the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 1, &sect; 11. The court denied defendants' motions to dismiss. It held that a higher level of scrutiny was appropriate than the traditional rational basis equal protection test when dealing with gender-based classifications. The court held that N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Gender-based legislative classifications are subject to a &quot;middle tier&quot; equal protection test requiring a higher level of scrutiny than the traditional rational basis equal protection test which only requires some rational and articulable reason in order to pass constitutional muster, but less stringent scrutiny than is applied under the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; test for &quot;suspect&quot; classifications such as race, alienage or nationality which requires that the statute accomplish some legitimate State objective by the least restrictive means possible; classifications by gender must serve some important governmental objective and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Statutory Rape -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Statutory rape statutes, which define rape as an exclusively male crime perpetrated only against young females without any concomitant provision for commission by a female ( Penal Law, &sect; 130.35, subd 3; &sect; 130.25, subd 2), are constitutional under the &quot;middle tier&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  equal protection test applicable to review the constitutionality of gender-based legislative classifications since protecting young females from physical and psychological damage and from getting pregnant serve important governmental objectives and the gender-based classification is substantially related to those objectives.  Since most of the problems encountered by females when pregnant do not accrue to males who engage in sexual intercourse, the sexes are not similarly situated and the argument that males receive unconstitutional unequal treatment therefore lacks merit.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for robbery, photographed, and fingerprinted. The proceeding was dismissed. The trial judge ordered that defendant's photographs be returned to him forthwith and the other records sealed.

Defendant was then placed in a corporeal lineup and identified. Defendant was arrested and charged with murder.

A defendant has no inherent or constitutional right to the return of any photographs, fingerprints or other indicia of an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arrest where the charges are dismissed, but rather such a remedy is statutorily mandated ( CPL 160.50); such a remedial statute being designed to place a successful defendant in the same position that he occupied prior to his arrest and to remove the &quot;stigma&quot; of the alleged criminal activity and its adverse affect on an accused and not to immunize a defendant from the operation of a law enforcement official's investigatory display of a photograph, albeit in contravention of statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Return of Photographs -- Identification Based on Retained Photograph</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The word &quot;forthwith&quot; set forth in a statute requiring that a defendant's photograph, fingerprints and other indicia of arrest be returned to him &quot;forthwith&quot; pursuant to court order upon the favorable termination of a criminal action ( CPL 160.50) means not only immediately, but &quot;within a reasonable time and with reasonable dispatch&quot; and is not to be equated with instantaneous delivery of the photograph so that compliance should be measured by whether the police returned the photograph within a reasonable amount of time and in a reasonable manner.  Accordingly, a five-week interval between the court order requiring&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the police to return defendant's photograph to him following the dismissal of the robbery charge for which the photograph was taken and the police display of the photo to an eyewitness to a homicide who identified defendant from the photograph as the perpetrator and then later selected defendant from a corporeal lineup, was a reasonable period within which the police could comply with the court order and, in the absence of any proof of bad faith, deliberate or intentional withholding of the photograph as a maneuver to circumvent the remedial purpose of the statute, the failure of the police to return defendant's photograph to him cannot be deemed to have tainted the subsequent identification procedures so as to warrant suppression of the identification testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Return of Photographs -- Identification Based on Retained Photograph</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since the mere retention and use of defendant's photograph by the police in violation of a statute requiring that such photograph be returned to the defendant &quot;forthwith&quot; pursuant to court order upon the favorable termination of the criminal charge against him ( CPL 160.50), does not constitute a denial of defendant's constitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rights, a subsequent identification emanating from the &quot;illegal&quot; photograph should not be suppressed. In any event, even assuming a violation of the statute and that said violation was of constitutional proportions, the identification testimony of an eyewitness to a homicide who identified defendant as the perpetrator from his photograph and then later selected defendant from a corporeal lineup, would still not be suppressed since the photo and lineup identification procedures were not unnecessarily suggestive and the identification possessed &quot;sufficient aspects of reliability&quot; under the &quot;totality of circumstances&quot; to be admissible in that the eyewitness had ample opportunity to clearly observe the defendant at &quot;eyeball&quot; distance for a lengthy period of time during their confrontation and his identification of defendant was certain and unequivocal, resulting more from his mental recall of his encounter with defendant during the commission of the criminal act rather than from the viewing of defendant's photograph. </SPAN></P>

The court held that the school owners failed to meet the burden of demonstrating a constitutional infirmity. However, the commissioner did not comply with the legislative mandate directing and empowering him to promulgate the necessary rules and regulations pertaining to tuition and maintenance rates. Because the department was attempting to recoup overpayments already made, the school owners were entitled to a hearing with respect to the 1976-1977 tuition and maintenance rates. In view of the fact that a hearing was ordered with respect to the 1976-1977 rates, the same hearing should also inquire into and determine the factual questions that affected the prospective rates as well.</SPAN></P>

Article 89 of the Education Law, which delegates to the Commissioner of Education the power to determine tuition and maintenance rates for the care and education of handicapped children in nonpublic schools without setting forth specific guidelines and precise standards for the commissioner to follow, is constitutional since the complexities of the area and the constant change and expansion of the techniques utilized require fairly broad and necessarily imprecise statutory standards which will enable the State Education Department to carry out its statutory responsibility to &quot;stimulate all private and public efforts designed to relieve, care&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for or educate handicapped children and * * * formulate such rules and regulations&quot; as are deemed to be in their best interests to provide for their physical and educational needs (Education Law, &sect; 4403), such general directions being sufficiently precise to carry out the intended beneficial purpose of the legislation.  In any event, plaintiffs have failed to meet the burden of demonstrating the invalidity of the legislation beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- Education of Handicapped Children -- Tuition and Maintenance Rates</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A memorandum of agreement between the State Education Department, the Department of Audit and Control and other State agencies involved in the education of handicapped children, setting forth a &quot;common set of standards to be used in establishing tuition rates and maintenance rates for conducting field audit examinations&quot; for private institutions for handicapped children, including uniform standards for allowable administration and leasing and rental costs, has no legal validity or effect as a rule or regulation since the agreement, as a statement of &quot;general applicability&quot; which &quot;prescribes the procedure requirements of an agency&quot;, is intended&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to function as if it were a regulation and not merely as an internal auditing procedure, and, as such, it must be promulgated (Executive Law, &sect; 101-a; State Administrative Procedure Act, &sect; 202) and then filed with the Secretary of State (NY Const, art IV, &sect; 8; Executive Law, &sect; 102; State Administrative Procedure Act, &sect; 203) in order to become effective and binding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- Education of Handicapped Children -- Recoupment of Overpayments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The absence of precise rules and standards pertaining to the establishment of tuition rates and maintenance rates for private schools for handicapped children (see 8 NYCRR 200.11, 200.13) does not prohibit the recouping of claimed overpayments made pursuant to interim rates since the Commissioner of Education has the power to approve maintenance expenses and determine tuition costs, with or without regulations (Education Law, &sect; 4401).  The commissioner acted properly in relying upon an audit conducted by the State Comptroller in retroactively decreasing plaintiffs' tuition and maintenance rates since all rates were provisional and conditioned upon an audit and, thus, plaintiffs had no final and vested ownership in the sums authorized&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or received prior to the audit. In addition, plaintiffs, in the agreement with the State Education Department, acknowledged that their accounts were subject to audit and that any overpayments would be reimbursed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- Education of Handicapped Children -- Hearing on Recoupment of Overpayments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Although plaintiffs, the operators of private schools for handicapped children, had no final or vested ownership in sums received from the State Education Department (Education Law, art 89) prior to an audit, since substantial property rights are at stake with respect to the recoupment of claimed overpayments made pursuant to interim tuition and maintenance rates, due process requires that plaintiffs be granted a prompt hearing with respect to such prior tuition and maintenance rates notwithstanding the absence of any express statutory or regulatory requirements for such a hearing.  Although due process does not require a hearing for prospective rates in the absence of such a requirement by statute or regulation, the hearing with respect to the prior rates should also inquire into and determine the factual questions which will affect the prospective rates as well as involving&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the appropriate measure by which to establish the correct formula for determining rent, the nature of the relationship between plaintiffs and their landlord, by what percentage plaintiffs' salaries should be increased and any other matters of existing disagreement between the parties.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff teacher filed an action against defendant board of education seeking to declare the by-laws of the Board of Education of the City of New York, &sect; 492(A) unconstitutional in connection with the denial of her application for salary credit for the three years of teaching experience she acquired when she moved out of state and after her resignation, and the parties had filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A teacher appointed by a board of education in New York to teach in a school, resigned to move to another state. Later, she returned to New York, and she received permission to withdraw her resignation and resumed service as a regular teacher. She applied for salary credit for her teaching experience while she was out of state, and the board denied the request under &sect; 492(A), under which teachers, who resigned and later withdrew their resignations, were denied salary credit for teaching experience gained during their absence. She then sought a declaration that &sect; 492(A) was unconstitutional alleging violation of equal protection. The court held that: (1) any penalty exacted on the teacher's mobility was purely economic, which did not affect a fundamental interest; (2) hence, the test to be applied was the rational basis test, or whether the challenged classification bear a reasonable relationship to a legitimate legislative objective; and (2) section 492(A) was valid and constitutional because it bear a reasonable relationship to the legitimate legislative objective of attracting qualified teachers and of discouraging equally qualified teachers from leaving the school system.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A provision of the by-laws of the Board of Education of the City of New York which denied to former New York City teachers who have resigned and subsequently withdrawn their resignations, salary credit for teaching experience gained during their absence does not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, since the strict scrutiny test is inapplicable because the only &quot;penalty&quot; which could be said to be exacted is purely economic and does not reach the fundamental significance espoused by case law, and in applying the rational basis test, the strong presumption of constitutionality must be overcome and unconstitutionality must be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt; a statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts may reasonably be conceived to justify it, and the by-law at issue passes constitutional muster inasmuch as it serves to attract qualified teachers and to discourage equally qualified teachers from leaving the school system. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owned rental property that was subjected to a town ordinance regulating residential rental property, which provided that a rental permit would not be issued unless a voluntary inspection and search of the premises was allowed.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A declaratory judgment action against the State Tax Commission rather than an article 78 proceeding is the proper remedy to determine whether plaintiff is entitled to interest on a refund of an illegally collected mortgage tax since a declaratory judgment action is proper to determine the application of a tax statute where it is claimed that the imposition of the tax is inapplicable to the situation and the statutory provisions dealing with appeals in mortgage tax matters (Tax Law, &sect;&sect; 251, 263) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  do not mandate that an article 78 proceeding be the exclusive method of review; furthermore, since the State Tax Commission, in finding that the mortgage tax was improperly collected, did not undertake to make any decision on the issue of interest on the mortgage tax refund, there is no determination per se to review in an article 78 proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The state had the authority to require the county to contribute to the authority because the authority was a public transportation service that provided a valid public purpose to the county.  N.Y. Transp. Law &sect; 18-b(c)(5) did not conflict with N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 because the county was not incurring any indebtedness, especially where the county did not directly pay the contributions where the state withheld the amount of the contributions from state aid. Also, the contributions were not a gift but consideration for a public benefit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Within certain special assessment districts, the ordinances regulated the time and place in which mobile food vendors could park or stand for extended periods. Plaintiff claimed that the ordinances were illegally discriminatory, arbitrary, and enacted under an improper motive. The court dismissed the complaint because plaintiff did not rebut the presumption of constitutionality of the ordinances beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the ordinances were not discriminatorily directed at plaintiff's business, but were applied to all mobile vendors as a general class, all of whom were treated alike in the privileges conferred and in the liabilities imposed. The court also found that there was a reasonable basis for the ordinances and that they were directed toward legitimate legislative objectives of traffic congestion, access to parking, and public safety. The court ruled that the time restrictions imposed by the ordinances were not unreasonable and that defendant had the authority to regulate the use of metered parking areas to achieve what it felt to be in the public interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A strong presumption exists in favor of the constitutionality of legislative enactments, including municipal ordinances, and it is incumbent upon the one challenging the enactment to rebut the presumption of constitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt, the primary concern upon a claim of unconstitutionality being whether the statute as written and applied, constitutes a valid exercise of the police power and whether the means adopted by the statute are reasonably related to the purpose intended to be accomplished; the validity of the statute or ordinance is to be determined from its general purpose and its efficiency to accomplish the end desired in cases which may be expected to arise, and not from its effect in the particular case which is before the court.  The necessity and advisability of the ordinance is for the legislative power to determine and not for the court and, if a statute appears on its face constitutional and valid, the courts cannot inquire into the motives of the members of the municipal legislative body nor can the influence under which they act be shown to nullify an ordinance duly passed in legal form within&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the scope of their power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Hawkers and Peddlers -- Regulation of Mobile Vendors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While a city cannot by ordinance prohibit peddling in certain sections of the city where conditions in the restricted section are not dissimilar from those existing in many other areas and where the ordinance bears no rational relation to the welfare of the public but is instead designed for the convenience and interest of a special class, it may, however, validly prohibit vending in restricted areas and streets in order to prevent interference with traffic where discrimination is based on traffic conditions; accordingly, municipal ordinances of the City of Syracuse which regulate the time and place in which mobile vendors may park or stand for extended periods in the most heavily traveled downtown area of the city by prohibiting retail sales from any vehicle occupying a metered parking space or from any zone where parking, standing or stopping is prohibited and by designating four locations as mobile vendor stands for retail sales which may only be utilized by the same mobile vendor for a 60-minute period, are valid, being based on legitimate concerns of public safety and convenience of preventing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  interference with traffic, avoiding undue congestion in the public streets and providing all mobile vendors with an equal opportunity to use the designated stands at some time.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that, notwithstanding the 1975 administrative directive, which directed that show cause orders pertaining to summary proceedings to recover possession of real property be signed only by judges presiding in the calendar part of the Housing Part, the legislature had authorized any Housing Judge, as well as any Civil Court or Acting Civil Court Judge, to grant concurrent Housing Court relief including the signing of show cause orders returnable before Housing Judges.

Defendants had 74,000 policies in New York, and sought to terminate their business activities due to increasing underwriting losses. Plaintiff New York Superintendent of Insurance commenced an action against defendants to compel them to continue to conduct business as insurance carriers in the state. The court held that defendants could terminate their business in the state, because to force them to operate a business against their wishes would violate their due process rights under the New York and United States Constitutions. The court also ruled that plaintiff had the power to ameliorate the consequences of defendants' termination by providing that the rights of existing policyholders would remain otherwise unimpaired, while permitting defendants to phase out their business in an orderly fashion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled the defendants had the right to terminate their business in the state, since, pursuant to the New York and United States Constitutions, a state could not compel a corporation to conduct a business against its choosing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Motor Vehicle Financial Security Act (Vehicle and Traffic Law, art 6), which requires that all motorists maintain liability insurance with a duly licensed insurer or other security for damages resulting from the use of a motor vehicle, does not justify compelling defendants to continue doing business as insurance carriers in the State since defendants' surrendering of their licenses will not immediately and automatically subject their insureds to all of the penalties of the act, as the Superintendent of Insurance has the power to ameliorate any adverse consequences by providing that the rights of existing policyholders remain otherwise unimpaired while permitting defendants to phase out their business in an orderly fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- No-Fault Automobile Insurance -- Automatic Renewal Provision</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The decision made by defendants insurers not to opt out of their automobile insurance policies prior to the effective date of the requirement in the no-fault law that all automobile policies in effect before August 1, 1973 be automatically renewable for three successive one-year periods (Insurance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Law, &sect; 167-a) without notice of three subsequent extensions of the automatic renewal provision through 1978, does not constitute a perpetual waiver of defendants' rights to cease doing business as insurance carriers in the State nor was such a procedure reasonably calculated to afford defendants due process in view of the subsequent extensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- Surrender of License to Conduct Insurance Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The potential adverse consequnces to holders of homeowners and fire policies which may result from defendants' surrendering their licenses to do business as insurance carriers in the State does not justify compelling defendants to continue doing business in the State since the Superintendent of Insurance has broad authority which would permit defendants to operate with a license/authority for an interim transition period during which appropriate safeguards would be adopted and existing policies would be deemed to comply with the relevant statutory and contractual requirements; similarly, the requirements that an insurer be licensed in order for insureds and claimants to be protected by the Property and Liability Insurance and Security Fund (Insurance Law, &sect;&sect; 333, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  334) and that an insurer accept assignments under the assigned risk plan and issue three-year coverage to motorists who cannot find placement in the voluntary market (Insurance Law, &sect; 63) does not warrant compelling defendants to continue doing business in the State since the Superintendent's interpretation would unreasonably prevent any insurer from ever terminating its business in the State in spite of the fact that there is no express legislative policy warranting such a drastic result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- Insurer's Right to Terminate in State</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The power of the State to regulate insurance companies is subject to an insurer's entitlement to due process which prohibits a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taking of private property for public use, without just compensation, which may consist of regulations which arbitrarily, unreasonably and without sufficient public purpose, deprive the owner of the benefits of his property; the validity of the no-fault law and the automatic renewal provisions contained therein (Insurance Law, &sect; 167-a) do not warrant compelling defendants to continue doing business as insurance carriers in the State since defendants are not seeking to reap the benefits of doing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  business here while &quot;dumping&quot; unprofitable automobile policies while retaining other more profitable areas of insurance coverage but rather are seeking to withdraw completely from conducting any insurance business in the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- Insurer's Right to Terminate its Business in State</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Compelling defendants insurers to continue doing as insurance carriers in the State at a loss without a just and reasonable connection with the public welfare, violates defendants' rights to due process since an insurer must retain some choice as to how it will conduct its business and the fact that defendants once submitted to government control by applying for licenses which gave them the privilege of engaging in the insurance business in the State, does not mean they must be forever in bondage, subject to such control; accordingly, defendants have the right to terminate their business in the State and the Superintendent of Insurance has the obligation to assure that such termination is orderly and not unnecessarily disruptive by developing a viable plan for defendants' speedy withdrawal from business in the State with assurances that current policyholders will not be unduly, adversely&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  affected.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant maintained that the statute was unconstitutional because the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had exclusive licensing power. The court held that the applicable portion of the statute did not deal with regulation of the airwaves in any manner. The statute was an exercise by the State of its police power by legislating against the equipping of motor vehicles with a certain type of radio device; therefore, the legislature did not infringe in an area pre-empted by federal law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to dismiss his indictment as an adult on criminal charges for certain violent crimes on the grounds that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 180.75 was unconstitutional as a denial of due process and equal protection. Defendant had been denied removal of the charges to family court for treatment as a juvenile under an &quot;interests of justice&quot; standard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a 14-year-old charged with multiple felonies resulting from entering the home of an elderly woman and robbing and raping her. Defendant was arraigned and the court conducted a hearing authorized under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 180.75 to determine if the case should be removed to family court in the interests of justice. The arraigning court found sufficient proof to hold defendant for the grand jury and found that the case was appropriate for criminal prosecution rather than transfer to family court. Defendant subsequently moved to dismiss the indictment claiming that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 180.75 was unconstitutional because the &quot;interests of justice&quot; standard provided no guidance to the arraigning court. The court denied the motion to dismiss, citing numerous statutory provisions that included the &quot;interests of justice&quot; standard and cases in which that standard was applied. The court noted that there was no basis for a due process claim because defendant was afforded an adversarial hearing that included the right to counsel, the right to confront witnesses, the right to present testimony, and the right to cross-examine witnesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment because defendant was afforded due process in the hearing to determine whether to remove his case to family court.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

An &quot;interests of justice&quot; standard is not incompatible with due process or tantamount to vagueness since statutes permitting courts to make a variety of profound determinations &quot;in the interests of justice&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or &quot;in furtherance of justice&quot; are an integral part of the criminal procedural process and have been upheld by appellate courts.</SPAN></P>

The decedent died intestate and left an estate in excess of $ 100,000, almost all of which was derived from veteran's benefits except for $ 8,177 from an estate of his sister and a small amount from two insurance policies. The court determined that all of the property of the decedent vested immediately upon his death in the United States as trustee for the sole use and benefit of the General Post Fund, pursuant to 38 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 5220, 5221.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

The failure to directly include potential female violators within the confines of rape statutes does not violate a fundamental interest of men since females are subject to prosecution under the rape statutes for accessorial conduct.  (Penal Law, &sect; 20.00.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Presumption of Validity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A strong presumption of validity attaches to statutes and the burden of proving invalidity rests upon those who challenge their constitutionality to establish this beyond a reasonable doubt.  There is a further presumption that the Legislature&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has investigated and found the facts necessary to support the legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Equal protection of the law does not prohibit the State from treating different classes of persons in different ways; however, statutory classifications for purposes of according different treatment must always rest on a difference which bears a fair, substantial, natural, reasonable and just relation to the object or purpose of the statute in order that all persons who are similarly situated are treated in the same way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection -- Standards for Judicial Review</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Under &quot;traditional&quot; equal protection analysis, a legislative classification will be sustained unless it is patently arbitrary and bears no rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest.  Where a statute affects a &quot;fundamental interest&quot; such as voting, travel and procreation, or employs a &quot;suspect&quot; classification such as race, national origin and alienage, the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; test is applied requiring that the legislative purpose be so compelling as to justify the means utilized.  The appropriate standard for judicial review with respect&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to classifications based upon sex is a &quot;middle tier&quot; standard requiring that classifications by gender serve important governmental objectives and be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.

The classification, based solely on physiology, not sex, is neither by design nor result in any way invidious, nor violative of any fundamental interest of men.  Without any evidence that female offenders constitute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a criminal problem of any importance, the presumption that the Legislature has investigated and found the facts necessary to support the legislation prevails.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to dismiss an indictment charging him with statutory rape and endangering the welfare of a child on grounds that the statutes defining the offenses, N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a male, was charged with rape in the third degree, commonly known as statutory rape, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.25(2), and endangering the welfare of a child, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 260.10, for allegedly having sexual intercourse with a girl less than 17 years old. He moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the statutes were unconstitutional in that they deprived him of the equal protection of the law since they differentiated on the basis of sex and only a male could engage in sexual intercourse with an underage female. In denying the motion, the court ruled that the statutes did not deprive males of equal protection of the law. Whereas only a male could be prosecuted under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.25(2) as a perpetrator, a female could also be prosecuted under that statute as an aider and abettor, pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 20.00.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Statutory Rape -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Since females may be prosecuted as principals for aiding and abetting in the commission of a rape (Penal Law, &sect; 20.00), there is no denial of equal protection where a rape statute only provides&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that a male 21 years or older is guilty when he engages in sexual intercourse with a female less than 17 years of age.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Statutory Rape -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Subdivision 2 of section 130.25 of the Penal Law, which provides that only a male 21 years or older is guilty of rape in the third degree when he engages in sexual intercourse with a female less than 17 years, is not violative of equal protection since the gender based classification bears a rational relationship to a legitimate State end of protecting young females from sexual intercourse and such a statutory classification based upon a valid distinction between the sexes is not constitutionally defective. Only females can become pregnant and the adverse effects to the unwed mother of tender years, to the illegitimate child and to society at large are reasons enough for the desirability of the legislation.  Equality of the sexes does not preclude legislation which deals with a physical characteristic unique to one sex.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was conceded that the litigant's status as a distributee was based upon an order of paternity that was obtained during the lifetime of the decedent but not until 1966, which was some 16 years after her birth. The widow claimed the filiation order was not timely obtained as required by N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 4-1.2(a)(2). The litigant claimed the restriction found in &sect; 4-1.2(a)(2), requiring the paternity proceeding to be instituted within two years from the birth of the child, was unconstitutional. The court found that certain judicial decisions had a distinct trend toward expanding the rights of illegitimates. The court held that the last 20 words of &sect; 4-1.2(a)(2) had to be disregarded as patently setting up an unconstitutional invidious distinction, unequally protecting children depending upon their age at the institution of successful paternity suits. The court held that the difficulty of proving paternity and the related danger of spurious claims provided the basis for requiring an order of filiation during the lifetime of the father.

Code &sect; B32-503.0(h) and &sect; B32-503.0 as a whole. The court held that &sect; B32-503.0(h) was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to give notice of the nature of the forbidden conduct and failed to set forth a standard by which police officers could determine who was in violation of the statute. Defendants argued that &sect; B32-503.0 was an invalid exercise of police power because it prohibited a legitimate business and it was arbitrary. The court found that N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 10 permitted New York City to enact local laws to promote the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, including the power to regulate city streets. However, such power had to bear a reasonable relation to the public good.

Penal Law &sect;&sect;235.05 and 235.15. Appellees argued that the statute's affirmative defense portion, N.Y. Penal Law &sect;235.15, was so vague it violated due process because common men of common intelligence were forced to guess at its meaning. The court rejected this argument and concluded the statute contained widely recognized reasons for viewing the obscene material including governmental, scientific, and educational purposes. The court found the &quot;other similar justification&quot; portion simply recognized certain valid reasons for possessing such material which might not fall within the enumerated categories. The court rejected the argument that the fact that the statute provided an affirmative defense to certain movie theatre employees violated equal protection principles. The court found the treatment of the theatre employee class satisfied the reasonable basis test because the legislature had a reasonable basis for the distinction based on the remote nature of exempted employees' contact with the obscenity and the restricted dissemination potential.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants, charged with promoting obscenity, have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute providing for affirmative defenses in obscenity prosecutions (Penal Law, &sect; 235.15) before their cases come to trial and thus before the time such affirmative defenses are raised.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Subdivision 1 of section 235.15 of the Penal Law, which makes it an affirmative defense in any prosecution for obscenity &quot;that the persons to whom the allegedly obscene material was disseminated * * * consisted of persons or institutions having scientific, educational, governmental or other similar justification for possessing&quot; such material, is not unconstitutionally vague since the words &quot;scientific&quot;, &quot;educational&quot; and &quot;governmental&quot; have well understood and widely recognized general meanings and the average court or jury would not experience serious difficulty in determining whether a particular affirmative defense interposed by a defendant at trial would fit within one or more of these categories.  The phrase &quot;other similar justification&quot; is likewise not unconstitutionally vague since the Legislature recognized the possibility that there may be justifiable reasons for the possession or viewing of obscene materials other than those within the three general categories specifically enumerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While the equal protection clause does not forbid the States from treating different classes of persons in different ways, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  legislative creation of a special class must be based upon a distinction separating that class from others, and the distinction must rest on some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relationship to the object of the legislation so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.</SPAN></P>

Subdivision 2 of section 235.15 of the Penal Law, which affords an affirmative defense in obscenity prosecutions to only certain nonmanagerial or nonsupervisory employees of motion picture theatres while not providing the same protection to employees of bookstores, is not invidiously discriminatory and therefore not violative of equal protection since the difference in treatment between motion picture theatre employees and other employees is rationally based on the unique distinction between obscene motion pictures and other printed obscene material. The Legislature could have taken into consideration the remote nature of the contact of the exempted theatre employees with the showing of an obscene film as contrasted to the more direct nature of the contact of bookstore employees with the reading material&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sold therein, and could have further determined that the showing of obscene motion pictures is more restrictive and therefore less pernicious than the dissemination of other forms of obscenity. </SPAN></P>

A presumption under &sect; 165.15(6) provided that when there was evidence of utility line tampering the person who received the service benefit had done so with knowledge of the tampering. Testimony existed that defendant attempted to bribe a serviceman away from turning him in. The presumption was found constitutional under a rational connection standard because it did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof to defendant or conclusively establish that the service recipient had knowledge of the tampering per se. The presumption merely provided a method whereby facts were deemed to be prima facie proof of other facts, permitting a reasonable inference to have been drawn against the person receiving the service, who then had the burden of coming forward to explain the situation.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Separate counts in an indictment charging defendant with grand larceny in connection with the theft of gas through the installation of by-passes tapping gas company lines in his two buildings, are not dismissed for being duplications of and inconsistent with other larceny counts covering same common scheme or plan since the question of whether a series of acts constitutes only a single larceny in execution of a general fraudulent scheme or more than one is an issue of fact for the jury to determine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Theft of Gas -- Larceny and Theft of Services</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Separate larceny and theft of services counts in an indictment in connection with the theft of gas by defendant through the installation of by-passes tapping gas company lines in his two buildings, are not inconsistent since the taking of gas, classified as both a &quot;service&quot; ( Penal Law, &sect; 155.00, subd 8) and a &quot;property&quot; ( Penal Law, &sect; 155.00, subd 1), can lawfully constitute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  both a larceny, defined as the &quot;wrongful taking&quot; or stealing of &quot;property&quot; ( Penal Law, &sect; 155.05, subd 1) and a theft of services, defined as the interference with the supplying of commodities of a public utility nature such as gas ( Penal Law, &sect; 165.15, subd 6), the two crimes being essentially different and separate even though the same facts are alleged in both crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Presumption of Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Legislative acts are afforded a strong presumption of constitutionality which demands that those attacking them demonstrate invalidity beyond a reasonable doubt. It is the obligation of a court to construe a statute to preserve its constitutionality wherever possible, striking down a statute only as a last unavoidable result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Criminal Presumptions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The basic premise, applied by Federal courts, is that a criminal presumption violates due process if there is no rational connection between the facts proved and the facts inferred or presumed. However, New York has a higher standard of rational connection, holding the constitutional standard to be whether, based on life and life's experiences, a rational connection between&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed may be said to exist.  The facts presumed must have a natural, not an unnatural, connection with facts proven and the connection must assure a reasonably high degree of probability that the presumed fact follows from the given evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Theft of Services Presumption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The theft of services presumption ( Penal Law, &sect; 165.15, subd 6), which provides that when there is evidence of tampering with utility lines, there is a presumption that the one who receives the use and benefit of the service has done so with knowledge of the tampering, is constitutional since there is a rational connection between the fact proved and fact presumed, permitting a reasonable inference to be drawn that the owner of the building receiving the service had knowledge of the tampering. The fact that defendant, the owner of two buildings which received free gas service through the use of by-passes which tapped gas company lines, was never actually caught installing a by-pass is irrelevant since direct evidence is not needed.  In any event, defendant admitted having knowledge of the tampering when he attempted to &quot;bribe&quot; a gas company serviceman, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  making the rational connection between the presumed fact and the proven fact even easier to demonstrate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Theft of Services Presumption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The theft of services presumption ( Penal Law, &sect; 165.15, subd 6), which provides that when there is evidence of tampering with utility lines, there is a presumption that the one who receives the use and benefit of the service has done so with knowledge of the tampering, is constitutional since there is no shift in the burden of proof, there being no requirement that the presumed fact flow from the proven fact beyond a reasonable doubt but only that there be a rational connection between the presumed fact and the proved fact.  Given the fact of a by-pass, which tapped gas company lines, it is not unreasonable to presume that defendant, as owner of the building, knew of its existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Theft of Services Presumption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The theft of services presumption ( Penal Law, &sect; 165.15, subd 6), which provides that when there is evidence of tampering with utility lines, there is a presumption that the one who receives the use and benefit of the service has done so with knowledge of the tampering, does not unconstitutionally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shift the burden of proof from the People to the defendant since such a permissive, rebuttable presumption merely provides a method whereby certain facts are deemed to be prima facie proof of other facts, authorizing, but not requiring, the jury to find the presumed fact from the fact in evidence, and the ultimate question of whether the defendant had knowledge of the tampering despite the presumption must still be proven by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt. The presumption does not conclusively establish that the one who is receiving the service has knowledge of the tampering per se, but instead, it merely permits a reasonable inference to be drawn against the owner who then has the burden of coming forward and explaining the situation and even if he fails to satisfactorily explain the situation, the jury must still decide if the prosecution has satisfied its burden of persuasion in proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Evidence -- Burden of Proof -- Burden of Persuasion and of Going Forward with Evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The burden of persuasion remains on the same party throughout a trial and never shifts, while the burden of going forward with the evidence shifts from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  one party to the other and is in no way related to the burden of persuasion. A criminal presumption, such as the theft of services presumption ( Penal Law, &sect; 165.15, subd 6), which operates to aid the prosecution, does not affect the prosecutor's ultimate burden of persuasion to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but instead places a burden on the defendant to come forward with evidence to explain away, destroy or rebut the inference to be drawn.  The presence of a rational connection between the presumed fact and the proven fact prevents the burden of proof from shifting impermissibly to the defendant.  </SPAN></P>

The reporter argued that she should have been exempted under the journalist's privilege. Because the officer planned to testify at defendant's trial, the court held that the privilege, which protected the anonymity of the source, was waived. The shield law, N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 79-h, did not apply because it was expected that the identity of the undercover police officer would have been revealed and that his activities surrounding the investigation and arrest of defendant necessarily would have been part of the prosecution's case against defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner County Clerk of New York County initiated a proceeding to punish respondent prospective grand juror for contempt pursuant to N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 751 for her refusal to submit to fingerprinting as a prospective grand juror pursuant to N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 16. The prospective grand juror moved to dismiss the petition pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 404(a), based upon an objection in point of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prospective grand juror complied with all the requirements to qualify as a grand juror, including answering the grand juror questionnaire, as required by N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 513, objecting only to the required fingerprinting. The prospective grand juror contended that N.Y Jud. Law &sect; 514 and N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. 620.6 constituted an improper invasion of privacy and a denial of equal protection of the law. The court determined that the purpose of the fingerprinting requirement was to lessen the chances of premature disclosure of grand jury proceeding by eliminating ex-felons and persons of questionable character from sitting as grand jurors. The court held that the arguments in favor of fingerprinting greatly outweighed those against it and rejected the prospective grand juror's claim that the procedure violated her Fourth Amendment rights. The court also found that the statute was not unconstitutional merely because it did not include other similarly situated classes of persons, such as petit jurors and witnesses. However, the court determined that once grand jurors' fingerprints had served their stated purpose, they were to be expunged or returned to the individuals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petition to punish the prospective grand juror for contempt and dismissed the petition without prejudice to subpoena again the prospective grand juror as a grand juror at some future date following the instituting of procedures to expunge grand jurors' fingerprints once their stated purpose was served, unless they were already on file, or to allow such fingerprints to be returned to the individuals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grand Jury -- Fingerprinting of Grand Jurors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The requirement that all potential grand jurors subpoenaed to serve be fingerprinted (Judiciary Law, &sect; 514; 22 NYCRR 620.6), under penalty of contempt, as part of the screening process to prevent ex-felons and persons of questionable character from sitting as grand jurors and thereby protect the security and confidentiality of Grand Jury proceedings, does not constitute an unreasonable search and seizure&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in view of the overriding public purposes for fingerprinting grand jurors. Since fingerprinting is only a means of verifying the existence or nonexistence of a prior criminal record, involving none of the probing into an individual's private life and thoughts that marks an interrogation or search, the actual intrusion and inconvenience being minor, and is widely used in noncriminal contexts and no longer carries a stigma or any implication of criminality, the factors in favor of fingerprinting greatly outweigh any violation of a grand juror's rights of privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grand Jury -- Fingerprinting of Grand Jurors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The fact that both petit jurors and witnesses are asked under oath whether they have committed crimes but are not fingerprinted, while potential grand jurors are required to be fingerprinted (Judiciary Law, &sect; 514; 22 NYCRR 620.6) does not deny equal protection to potential grand jurors since the failure to include all other possible groups within the scope of the fingerprinting requirement does not render unconstitutional an otherwise proper legislative requirement.  The fact that the fingerprinting requirement has resulted in the screening out of a significant number&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of persons with prior convictions from the list of qualified grand jurors is sufficient to show that the requirement is fulfilling its purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grand Jury -- Fingerprinting of Grand Jurors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While the requirement that potential grand jurors be fingerprinted (Judiciary Law, &sect; 514; 22 NYCRR 620.6) is constitutionally permissible, serving a valid purpose in obtaining vital information as to the qualifications of prospective grand jurors, the privacy rights of potential grand jurors mandate that the fingerprint records be expunged or returned to the individuals once the fingerprints have been taken and checked against other files since there is no sound public policy served by the retention of fingerprint records once they have served their stated purpose.  Accordingly, in order to properly safeguard the individual's constitutional rights, the procedures established for fingerprinting should be accompanied by the right to the return of such prints when no longer needed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After its application for a license was denied by defendant license director, plaintiff amusement company sought injunctive relief from the enforcement of Buffalo, N.Y., Ordinances ch. VII, &sect; 27, which prevented the company from operating pinball machines within the limits of defendant city. The company's request was denied and it again sought an injunction on the grounds that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company contended that the language of the ordinance was so vague and loose that it left those required to apply it so wide a discretion as to allow for arbitrary and capricious decisions. The company also argued that it was not afforded a hearing and that the ordinance was defective for failing to provide it with procedural due process. The court found that while the power to exercise discretion had to be accompanied by certain standards, the enactment was not required to specify details and only had to provide a general guide for the licensing director. The court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague. The court conceded that the company did not receive a hearing, but held that because its license applications were denied for requesting the licensing of two &quot;pinball machines&quot; which were specifically declared illegal by Buffalo, N.Y. Ordinances ch. VII, &sect; 27(1)(b), the licensing director's action was purely administerial and no hearing could be implied because the determination was not judicial in nature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Licenses -- Legislative Standards in Licensing Ordinances</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The due process criteria of legislative standards in licensing ordinances is not that all be informed by a statute as to what it commands or forbids and that all men of common intelligence, experience and understanding must not be forced to guess at its meaning, but rather is only to afford a reasonable guide to the licensing authority.  While the power&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  delegated to a licensing authority in a licensing ordinance must be accompanied by certain standards, the ordinance need only provide a general guide for the licensing agent and need not specify details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Licenses -- &quot;Gambling Devices&quot; and &quot;Pinball Machines&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A municipal licensing ordinance which, in prohibiting the operation of any &quot;gambling device&quot;, including &quot;pinball machines&quot; within the City of Buffalo, uses the phrase &quot;element of chance&quot; to define a &quot;gambling device&quot; without further prescribed standards to aid the licensing authority in granting or refusing a license application, is not unconstitutionally vague, arbitrary or unreasonable since the ordinance provides a reasonable general guide for the licensing authority.  The standards or guides in a licensing ordinance need only be prescribed in so detailed a fashion as is reasonably practicable in the light of the complexities of the particular area to be regulated since necessity fixes a point beyond which it is unreasonable and impracticable to compel the legislative body to prescribe detailed rules.  Such an ordinance aimed at the use to which gaming devices are put rather than their inherent characteristics&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that motivated their interdiction does not violate due process.  (See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Albert Simon, Inc. v Myerson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 36 NY2d 300.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Licenses -- &quot;Gambling Devices&quot; and &quot;Pinball Machines&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although an administrative authority must provide a license applicant a fair hearing, even though the delegating statute does not mandate a hearing, when the applicant's property rights will be adversely affected by an administrative determination which is judicial in nature, plaintiff is not entitled to a hearing on the denial of its application for the issuance of licenses to operate &quot;pinball machines&quot; pursuant to a municipal licensing ordinance which prohibits the operation of such &quot;gambling devices&quot; within the City of Buffalo, since &quot;pinball machines&quot; are specifically declared illegal by the ordinance, making the licensing director's action in denying plaintiff's applications purely administerial for which no hearing is required rather than judicial or quasi-judicial in nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Licenses -- &quot;Gambling Devices&quot; and &quot;Pinball Machines&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiff is not entitled to a hearing on the denial of its applications for licenses to operate &quot;pinball machines&quot; pursuant to a municipal licensing ordinance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which prohibits the operation of such &quot;gambling devices&quot; within the City of Buffalo, since any municipality, as a valid exercise of its police powers, has the right to prohibit or regulate trafficking in gambling, making the issuance of the license requested by plaintiff a privilege to which plaintiff had no clear legal right.  Although generally, a license applicant seeking to conduct an ordinary occupation or business has an initial right to be granted a license, failing a showing by the licensing authority that the applicant has forfeited that right, thereby entitling such applicant to a hearing to contest the denial of a license, such is not the case where, as here, the applicant's occupation is not one of an ordinary nature to which many individuals aspire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Licenses -- &quot;Gambling Devices&quot; and &quot;Pinball Machines&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A municipal licensing ordinance which prohibits the operation of &quot;gambling devices&quot;, including &quot;pinball machines&quot; in the City of Buffalo, does not violate due process by failing to provide a hearing for a license request since the issuance of a license to operate a gambling device is a privilege, not a legal right, for which no hearing is constitutionally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  required.  If the ordinance has outlived the legitimate concern of the proliferation of gambling and gaming devices that it originally set out to guard against, it is for the Buffalo Common Council to investigate and legislate accordingly.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state sought a final determination by the family court as to whether the court had authority to fix bail for a juvenile respondent removed from the criminal court to the family court on charges of third degree battery, assault and criminal possession of stolen property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was charged as a juvenile offender in criminal court with burglary, assault and criminal possession of stolen property. At his preliminary hearing, he was remanded in lieu of bail. His charges were reduced and he was removed to the family court. Upon removal, the criminal court revoked his bail. The family court determined that it was empowered to fix bail for juveniles. In its most literal meaning, the amended Family Court Act specifically authorized the family court to act on the matter of bail when a juvenile respondent appeared before it after a removal and was free on bail, as fixed by the criminal court. Since a statute must be construed, if at all possible, to preserve its constitutionality, the court was required to interpret the language of the law so as not to conflict with constitutional guarantees of equal protection. In light of the fact that the family court had presumptive authority to fix bail for juveniles initially appearing before it, and because a distinction could not be made between juveniles removed to family court with existing bail, as opposed to those with bail revoked by the criminal court, the family court granted bail.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Family Court Act, the family court had authority to grant respondent bail.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statute making it a traffic infraction for a person driving or in charge of a motor vehicle to permit it &quot;to stand unattended without first stopping the engine, locking the ignition, removing the key from the vehicle&quot;, except for &quot;keys hidden from sight about the vehicle for convenience and emergency&quot; (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 1210, subd [a]), is not unconstitutionally vague or unenforceable since it is totally clear that it is incumbent upon the person driving or in charge of the vehicle not only to refrain from leaving the vehicle unattended without first stopping the engine but also that if he does so and fails to lock the ignition and remove the key &quot;from the vehicle&quot;, he will be in violation of the statute.  Whether defendant's car reversed itself because of a defect in the mechanism does not affect his guilt under the statute for leaving his car unattended while the engine was running since issues of negligence and liability are not totally consistent with or coterminous with the questions of violation of the statute and such issues will have to be determined in other actions and proceedings.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state police officer was held personally liable to an individual for unlawfully arresting and then physically abusing him. The individual also sought damages against the state on the theory of respondeat superior. Defendants argued that the action was precluded by collateral estoppel and they sought summary judgment.

The court held that there were substantial differences between the Civil Rights Act and the elements of the cause of action alleged in the claim. Thus, the court held that the application of respondeat superior would depend on the facts, and the facts must be presented in a plenary trial. The court held that the actions of the state and other defendants appeared to have been excessive and was sufficient to fasten liability upon the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Estoppel -- Collateral Estoppel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The doctrine of collateral estoppel, a fundamental principle of jurisprudence which applies when issues of fact have been previously decided in a former action and were judicially determined in such a manner that they may not be litigated in a subsequent litigation, may only be invoked where there is an identity of issue which has necessarily been decided in the prior action and where there has also been a full and fair opportunity to contest the decision now said to be controlling.  (See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Schwartz v Public Administrator</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 24 NY2d 65.) Testing the fairness of the earlier litigation requires an exploration of the various elements which make up the realities of litigation including such considerations as the size of the claim, the forum of the prior litigation, the use of initiative, the extent of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  litigation, the competence of counsel, the availability of new evidence, indications of a compromise verdict, differences in the applicable law and foreseeability of future litigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Estoppel -- Collateral Estoppel -- Prior Federal Court Civil Rights Action</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Substantial and fundamental differences between a prior Federal court civil rights action (US Code, tit 42, &sect; 1983) in which a jury held a State police officer personally liable to claimant based upon a finding that the officer, while acting under color of State law, unlawfully arrested and then physically abused claimant in violation of claimant's constitutional rights, and an action against the State based on the same alleged acts of police brutality, prevent the prior Federal action from being used by claimant as collateral estoppel in the action against the State.  The existence of any reasonable doubt as to what was decided by the prior civil rights action will be resolved against using the prior judgment as an estoppel. Besides the inherent differences between the civil rights cause of action in the Federal court and the claim against the State, the inconsistent jury verdict, holding only one of the two&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  officers involved in the incident liable, while the claim against the State alleges wrongs committed by both officers, is another factor which casts a shadow upon the use of the doctrine of collateral estoppel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Estoppel -- Collateral Estoppel -- Prior Federal Court Civil Rights Action</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A prior Federal court civil rights action (US Code, tit 42, &sect; 1983) in which a State police officer was held personally liable to claimant for unlawfully arresting and then physically abusing claimant, may not be used by claimant as collateral estoppel in an action against the State based on the same alleged acts of police brutality since the State, which initially appeared for the individual officers involved pursuant to section 17 of the Public Officers Law but then properly withdrew from the defense of the two officers because of the existence of a possible conflict of interest between the codefendants themselves and between the codefendants and the State, did not have a full and fair opportunity to contest the jury verdict in the Federal court.  The doctrine that a party who had the right to control the conduct of the litigation can be estopped from relitigating the issues even though&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not a party or privy to the prior suit only operates against those who will be directly responsible, vicariously or by agreement should judgment go against the party defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Estoppel -- Collateral Estoppel -- Pendency of Appeal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. While the pendency of an appeal does not preclude the judgment's use as an estoppel, the requirement that a party have had a full and fair opportunity to contest the prior judgment before collateral estoppel may be invoked against such party mandates consideration of the existence of an appeal as one factor to be considered before the prior judgment can be used as an estoppel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Estoppel -- Collateral Estoppel -- Prior Federal Court Civil Rights Action</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution, which bars Federal courts from ordering States as defendants to give monetary relief or to enter judgments for money damages and which bars civil rights suits (US Code, tit 42, &sect; 1983) not only against the State when it is named as a party, but also when it is the party in fact, as where the suit seeks to impose a liability which must be paid from public funds in the State treasury, prevents a prior Federal court civil rights&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  action, in which a State police officer was held personally liable to claimant for unlawfully arresting and then physically abusing claimant, from being used by claimant as collateral estoppel in an action against the State based on the same alleged acts of police brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Estoppel -- Collateral Estoppel -- Offensive Use</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Although the fact that claimant may not use a prior Federal court civil rights action (US Code, tit 42, &sect; 1983) in which a State police officer was held personally liable for unlawfully arresting and then physically abusing claimant, as collateral estoppel against the State in action based on the same alleged acts of police brutality, does not preclude the State from using collateral estoppel offensively as a sword to avoid a finding of vicarious liability as an employer based on the prior award of punitive damages indicating that the officer was acting outside the scope of his employment, the substantial differences between the civil rights cause of action and the elements of the cause of action against the State require that a plenary trial be held to determine the application of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">respondeat superior</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and whether the State can be held liable for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the acts of the police officer. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner adoptee filed an application under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 114 for a court order unsealing the records of her adoption. She claimed that no showing of good cause was required for unsealing the record of a private placement, or, if any cause was required, that good cause existed. She also alleged that the statutory scheme denied her equal protection of the law contrary to U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An adoptee argued that &sect;114 applied only to agency adoption records and ceased to apply once she became an adult. She claimed that good cause existed for unsealing the records because a psychological problem interfered with her artistic skills, she was fearful of contracting an incestuous marriage, and she was desirous of learning her natural mother's religion in order to establish the faith of her son and herself. She also alleged that &sect; 114 created a suspect classification by imposing restrictions on adoptees' access to birth records that were not placed on nonadopted persons. The court held that &sect; 114 applied to both agency adoptions and private placements and required that records remain sealed forever unless good cause was shown. The evidence failed to show a medical or psychological need for genetic data; the adoptee was merely curious about her natural parents' identities. The statute was a legitimate exercise of the state's police power reasonably related to the goal of promoting adoptions. It protected the privacy interests of natural parents and the adoptee had no constitutionally protected interest that required the unsealing of her adoption record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the application and dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Sealing Adoption Records</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The provisions for the sealing of adoption records allowing disclosure only by court order upon a showing of &quot;good cause&quot; set forth in section 114 of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Domestic Relations Law, which is part of title 2 of the law entitled &quot;Adoptions from an authorized agency&quot;, are, by reference, equally applicable to both private placement and agency adoptions by virtue of subdivision 4 of section 116 of the Domestic Relations Law, which explicitly makes the sealing provisions of section 114 applicable to private placement adoptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Sealing Adoption Records</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Pursuant to the well-established principle of separation of powers that the judiciary may not, under the guise of construction, legislate by amending, modifying, extending, or otherwise creating a statutory provision alien to the clear language of that which has been enacted by the Legislature, but may only construe a statute to determine legislative intent in those situations where the language of the statute is either subject to more than one interpretation or is otherwise unclear, the statute governing the sealing of adoption records, which provides that all records of adoptions are sealed forever unless opened by a court order upon a showing of &quot;good cause&quot; (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 114), cannot be construed as not being applicable to an adoption record where the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  adoptee has become an adult since there is no statutory language limiting the period in which an adoption record remains sealed nor any other possible basis for concluding that there exists an unexpressed legislative intent that the sealing provisions not be applicable to adoptees who have reached their majority.  Since adoption statutes are in derogation of the common law, they must be strictly construed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Sealing Adoption Records</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In order to establish &quot;good cause&quot; sufficient to open sealed adoption records (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 114), the petitioner must show a present need to view the sealed records rising above mere desire or curiosity such as where access is necessary for a current medical or genetic reason or for a present psychological problem.  Accordingly, since petitioner failed to show that her lack of artistic achievement in the fields of poetry and music is in any way connected with her need to view her sealed adoption records or that her psychological problems are related to her adoptive status or that genetic data is needed for any medical treatment or that she or her son harbor any religious belief which would sustain a need to unseal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the records to learn the religious faith of her natural mother, the sole motivating cause for the application must be petitioner's curiosity as to her natural forebears which cannot constitute &quot;good cause&quot; or else every application to unseal adoption records would have to be perfunctorily granted thus ignoring the clear provisions of the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Presumption of Constitutionality Attaching to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A strong presumption of constitutionality attaches to all legislation and from this presumption flows a further presumption that the Legislature in enacting a statute, has investigated and found the facts necessary to support a need for the legislation.  A party seeking to declare a statute unconstitutional must demonstrate its invalidity beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Exercise of Police Power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The development of statutory procedures which will promote, encourage and facilitate the adoption of children, involving the moral needs and welfare of the State's citizens as well as the physical welfare of the children involved, is an area subject to the State's legitimate exercise of its police power, the least limitable of all the powers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of government extending to promote the moral, intellectual and spiritual needs of its people as well as physical or material interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Sealing Adoption Records</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  Section 114 of the Domestic Relations Law, which provides that all records of adoption are sealed forever unless opened by court order upon a showing of &quot;good cause&quot;, does not unconstitutionally deprive petitioner, an adoptee, of her right to her &quot;personality&quot; and &quot;privacy&quot; and &quot;to receive information about her origin&quot; since there is no such constitutional right to a &quot;personality&quot; or an unfettered right to receive any information one might desire.  The statute does not exceed the legitimate exercise by the State of its police powers in the area of adoption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- &quot;Strict Scrutiny&quot; Test -- Sealing of Adoption Records</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; test in determining the constitutionality of statutes, requiring a showing that a statutory classification has been drawn with sufficient narrowness so as to limit individuals to the minimum extent that is required to effectuate a legitimate State interest, is to be applied only when the classification impermissibly interferes with the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  exercise of &quot;fundamental rights&quot; which, in matters relating to the &quot;family&quot;, include procreation, marriage and divorce, or operates to the peculiar disadvantage to a &quot;suspect class&quot; saddled with such disabilities or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection.  Accordingly, since adoptees do not constitute a &quot;suspect class&quot; and an adoptee's right to learn the names of his or her natural parents is not a &quot;fundamental right&quot;, as the right to view sealed adoption records does not affect the enjoyment of the fundamental liberties required to freely pursue any activity basic to a full life, the more lax &quot;rational basis&quot; test rather than the more stringent &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; test is to be employed in testing the constitutionality of the statute providing for the sealing of adoption records.  (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 114.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- &quot;Rational Basis&quot; Test</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Under the &quot;rational basis&quot; test to determine if a statutory classification is offensive to the equal protection clause, a classification having some reasonable basis is not unconstitutional merely&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  because it is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality and will not be disturbed if any state of facts can reasonably be conceived to sustain the classification with the one assailing the classification having the burden of showing that it does not rest upon any reasonable basis but is palpably arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Sealing Adoption Records</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9.  Section 114 of the Domestic Relations Law, which, as part of the legitimate legislative goal of encouraging the adoption of children, provides that all adoption records are sealed unless opened by a court order upon a showing of &quot;good cause&quot;, is constitutional since petitioner, an adult adoptee, has failed to sustain her burden to establish that the need for confidentiality has no rational basis. The fact that other States allow adult adoptees open access to their adoption records has no bearing on the constitutionality of the New York statute since the subject is for legislative not judicial determination.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child and promoting a sexual performance by a child.

The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss, finding that the statutes were constitutional. The court held that the primary purpose of the statutes was the protection of children. The purpose was to eliminate the sexual exploitation of children by establishing strict criminal sanctions against individuals who induced children to participate in sexual performances and who profited from the distribution of such material. This was a valid legislative purpose, reasonable and rational, as was the escalation of penalty for those who abused or profited from such exploitation.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Obscene material has no constitutional sanction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or protection.  New York's definition of obscenity (Penal Law, &sect; 235.00) properly follows the guidelines of the United States Supreme Court (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Miller v California</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 413 U.S. 15) which are &quot;whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest * * * whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct as specifically defined by the applicable state law; and whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Protecting Welfare of Children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The State's legitimate interest in protecting the welfare of children and in seeing that they are safeguarded from abuses which might prevent their growth into free and well-developed citizens, may properly restrict what otherwise would be constitutionally protected conduct.  Even where ordinances have been struck down as facially invalid, the right of a Legislature to enact laws to protect children vis-a-vis sexual material has been sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Promoting Sexual Performances by Children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Article 263 of the Penal Law, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which proscribes promoting sexual performances by children under the age of 16 years, describing the prohibited forms of sexual conduct with anatomical precision and requiring a &quot;scienter&quot; limiting liability to those who know the character and content of what is being promoted, is not unconstitutionally vague since the statute clearly provides &quot;reasonably ascertainable standards of guilt&quot; affording a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what conduct is forbidden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Promoting Sexual Performances by Children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendant, the principal owner of bookstore charged with promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child and promoting a sexual performance by a child (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 263.10, 263.15) in connection with the sale of two &quot;Kiddie films&quot; to an undercover police officer, lacks the requisite standing to challenge the constitutionality of the special affirmative defenses available to projectionists, librarians, ushers, etc. (Penal Law, &sect; 263.20, subd 2), but not to similarly situated nonmanagerial employees in other types of establishments such as bookstores, since he is not of the class affected by the application of the statute and a person to whom a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  statute may constitutionally be applied will not be heard to challenge the statute on the ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Promoting Sexual Performances by Children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Section 263.10 of the Penal Law, which proscribes promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child under the age of 16 years, escalating punishment for promoting obscene material from a misdemeanor to a class D felony with a maximum of seven years for the legitimate purpose of eliminating the sexual exploitation of children by the establishment of strict criminal sanctions against individuals who induce children to participate in sexual performances and who profit from the distribution of such material, does not carry an unconstitutionally excessive penalty since the escalation of penalty for those who abuse or profit from such exploitation of children neither shocks the conscience nor offends the court's sense of fundamental fairness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Promoting Sexual Performances by Children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.

If it were important for literary or artistic value, simulation outside the prohibition of the statute could provide another alternative to the utilization of juveniles under 16 years of age.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The equal protection clause does not not deny the States the power to treat different classes of persons in different ways as long as the classification is reasonable so that a statutory classification which reasonably furthers a State policy based on a valid distinction between the sexes, such as a statutory rape statute focusing upon sexual intercourse between males and minor females, will be upheld since the protection of minor females from rape is a legitimate and essential legislative objective, the limitation of culpability to males constituting a rational classification directly related to the objective of the criminal penalty since only males can perpetrate that crime.  The Legislature could rationally have concluded that the danger of sexual exploitation by adult males of minor females and the resulting shame attendant on such activity in our society were so severe that this activity should be specially proscribed in a separate statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with the crime of obscenity in the second degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 235.05, for his sale of an obscene film to another. Defendant moved to dismiss upon grounds that the information was defective in that the statute, as applied, violated his constitutional rights insofar as it denied him equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Defendant contended that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 235.15 specifically exempted a motion picture projectionist from prosecution for obscenity but did not afford the same protection for a cashier in a bookstore. The court noted that there was a definite distinction between a projectionist and a bookstore cashier, as the latter was readily available to the public and permitted the potentially obscene material he sold to be taken from the store, which could then be possibly disseminated to the public at large. The court found this distinction to be rational and well planned in the state's legitimate interest in curbing the flow of obscenity. The court thereby ruled that it was constitutional and did not deny defendant equal protection. His application was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss and rejected his argument that a statute violated his equal protection rights, since it provided a reasonable basis for making a distinction between projectionists and bookstore cashiers to further the state interest in curbing the flow of obscenity. Thus, defendant was not denied equal protection as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment since the statute was indeed constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Social Security and veterans' disability benefits are of that class of benefits wherein the expectation of continuing entitlement is a sufficient &quot;property&quot; interest to afford constitutional protection before a recipient may be deprived of such a significant property interest by way of prejudgment or postjudgment remedies.  When such benefits are the sole sources of incomes for the recipients, such assets are akin to wages, the deprivation of which, for however long a duration, has the capacity to drive a family &quot;to the wall&quot;.  Accordingly, petitioners' interest in the unrestrained use of such exempt assets in their bank accounts free from postjudgment remedies ( CPLR art 52) is cognizable under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the due process clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Postjudgment remedies in aid of the enforcement of money judgments ( CPLR 5222, 5230, 5232) which permit a restraint upon the personal assets of a judgment debtor in the hands of a third party such as a bank without providing for notice to the debtor, are unconstitutionally violative of due process as applied to restrain a debtor's exempt assets, such as Social Security or veterans' disability benefits, which are protected from &quot;attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatever&quot; (US Code, tit 38, &sect; 3101, subd [a]; tit 42, &sect; 407; CPLR 5201, subds [a], [b]) absent adequate provision for notice thereof by service of the restraining notice or execution by the debtor.  Simultaneous or at least timely service upon the debtor of a copy of the CPLR 5222 restraining notice or CPLR 5230 execution with service upon the garnishee or levy against the property in the garnishee's possession would provide the debtor with adequate information as to the necessity for and the forum in which to press an exemption claim, while at the same time the assets temporarily frozen by restraint or levy would constitute a secure creditor resource&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for collection, subject to divestiture only by the debtor's claim of exemption successfully asserted and proven.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Once a judgment debtor has been guaranteed timely notice of a restraint placed upon his exempt assets ( CPLR 5201, subds [a], [b]) by the judgment creditor, CPLR article 52 provides the judgment debtor with sufficient opportunity to be heard to press his exemption claim.  The restraints imposed upon the judgment debtor's assets are entitled to a greater presumption of validity than their counterparts in a prejudgment seizure situation effected after ex parte application upon sworn documents of entitlement since, unlike the circumstances of prejudgment restraint, the liability issue has already been resolved against the debtor, assumedly after adequate notice and ample opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>

The postjudgment restraint or levy on the assets of a judgment debtor in the hands of a third party ( CPLR art 52) is subject to divestiture by the debtor ( CPLR 5239), who has the burden of claiming and proving that the restrained assets are exempt from execution since he alone possesses the facts necessary to prove that his assets are exempt assets ( CPLR 5201, subds [a], [b]) such as Social Security or veterans' disability benefits. There is no constitutional requirement placed upon the judgment creditor to serve a sworn affidavit of nonexemption in advance of restraint since, unlike the postjudgment restraint of wages or household goods subject to statutory exemption, neither the judgment creditor, his attorney nor the garnishee bank may have any knowledge of the source of the funds in the debtor's bank accounts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  CPLR article 52 provides sufficient opportunity for a speedy postrestraint determination of the judgment debtor's claims that his assets are statutorily exempt from execution since, under CPLR 5240, which permits the court, &quot;on its own initiative or the motion of any interested party&quot;, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to vacate a restraining notice or execution and void levy in order to &quot;protect judgment debtors from the harsh results of lawful enforcement procedures&quot;, the debtor is not relegated to commencing a plenary suit to either claim his exemption in advance of disposition ( CPLR 5239) or to recover retrospective damages for wrongful taking or injury ( CPLR 5205, subd [b]), but may instead make his exemption claim on motion in the forum in which the underlying judgment was entered ( CPLR 5221, subd [a]) on such notice and with such speed as the court may deem appropriate to the circumstances.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners sought equitable and monetary relief for alleged injuries from a municipal sewage plant in defendant cities. The court refused to dismiss the action for inverse condemnation finding that it was not duplicative of plaintiffs' nuisance action because it was to soon to tell whether damages existed amounting to a compensable taking, and such an award would have entitled plaintiffs to double interest. The action for unjust enrichment was dismissed in part because plaintiffs could only recover past payments that were made under protest, and rights taken by defendants, not the money defendants saved by improper operation. The action was not dismissed with respect to the taking of an easement for dumping waste because the general rule denying implied contractual liability against municipalities was inapplicable because defendants had the power of condemnation, and the claim arose out of tort rather than contract. No appropriate standard existed by which to hold defendants as public trustees for a breach of trust action. Plaintiffs' cross-motion to allow the class action was not premature and allowing defendants to contest the motion on the merits avoided prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- Inverse Condemnation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Inverse condemnation, a procedural vehicle for granting damages to an injured party where an entry cloaked with the powers of eminent domain has so interfered with the property rights of a landowner that it amounts to a compensable taking, arising in the context of situations where injunctive relief is sought but cannot be granted because of the equities of the comparative injuries, requires that there be a taking in the constitutional sense since, without a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taking, which requires a physical entry by the condemnor, a physical ouster of the owner, a legal interference with the physical use, possession or enjoyment of the property or a legal interference with the owner's power of disposition of the property, there is no appropriation. For example, in this State, airplane overflight states a cause of action for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taking where the overflight substantially diminishes the property in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- Inverse Condemnation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A cause of action against defendants municipalities for &quot;inverse condemnation&quot; based upon the discharge of untreated sewage from a joint municipal sewage&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plant onto plaintiffs' property is not unnecessarily redundant of plaintiffs' nuisance cause of action for which an award of damages for permanent nuisance may be made since both causes of action are proper where damages may be found to exist because of either unauthorized or illegal action on the part of defendants which amounts to a trespass or nuisance, or by authorized activity legal in all respects which so greatly diminishes the value of plaintiffs' property that it amounts to a compensable taking. Moreover, the fact that an award of damages for inverse condemnation will entitle the recipient of the award to interest on the judgment or accrued claim of 6% as opposed to the normal allowance of 3% (General Municipal Law, &sect; 3-a) is a sufficient reason in and of itself to let the cause of action for inverse condemnation stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Equity -- Unjust Enrichment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The general equitable principle of &quot;unjust enrichment&quot;, occurring where a party is enriched in an unjust manner by the receipt of money or its equivalent or by being saved from expense or loss, applies in this State to the remedies of constructive trust, implied contract, subrogation and indemnification, while in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  other States it has been associated with the remedies of restitution, quasi contract, money had and received, subrogation, equitable lien and rescission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Equity -- Unjust Enrichment -- Recovery of Past Sewer Taxes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Since the law affords no equitable relief to one who, with knowledge of the facts, makes a voluntary payment of money to one he does not owe, which includes payments of taxes and assessments, plaintiffs' claim that defendants municipalities have been unjustly enriched by retaining sewer rents and taxes voluntarily paid by plaintiffs without protest for the operation of a joint municipal sewage plant which allegedly discharged untreated sewage onto plaintiffs' property, does not state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Equity -- Unjust Enrichment -- &quot;Expense Saved&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Plaintiffs' claim of unjust enrichment based upon the &quot;expense saved&quot; defendants municipalities due to the alleged improper operation and maintenance of a joint municipal sewage plant resulting in the discharge of untreated sewage onto plaintiffs' property, does not state a cause of action since, although unjust enrichment can occur by the plaintiff saving the defendant from expense or loss, the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is not required to give the plaintiff the total benefit arising out of the plaintiff's property, but merely return the plaintiff's property or the reasonable value thereof.  In this case defendants do not have to pay plaintiffs the money that they did not spend, merely return to plaintiffs what they have received which is the right to dump wastes onto plaintiffs' property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Equity -- Restitution and Unjust Enrichment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Generally, land is not subject to the remedy of restitution since such an action is inconvenient for the purpose of determining title except where a &quot;person who, having the power to take land by eminent domain for a particular purpose, has taken possession of it for such purpose but does not take the required proceedings&quot;.  Restitution is therefore a proper remedy in plaintiffs' claim of unjust enrichment concerning the taking of an easement or using plaintiffs' property for the dumping of untreated wastes from a municipal sewage plant since title to the property is not in question and defendants municipalities have the power to acquire real property by condemnation for the &quot;maintenance and operation of a sewage disposal plant&quot; (General City Law, &sect; 20, subd&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2) and have allegedly taken possession and controlled plaintiffs' property by dumping sewage onto their lands.  Plaintiffs need not allege dispossession since the possession by defendants need not be exclusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Remedy of Quasi Contract against Municipality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The remedy of quasi contract requiring payment of the &quot;value of the use and occupation&quot; of land in situations of unjust enrichment from the use of the land, may be employed to fully compensate plaintiffs in their action against defendants municipalities arising from the discharge of untreated sewage from municipal sewage plant onto their lands since recovery may be allowed against a municipality in quasi contract for benefits received where no unenforceable contract in violation of a fundamental statutory restriction upon the powers of the municipality or its officers exists, and where using implied contract would not thwart the purpose of the statutory provisions relating to the manner of making a contract binding upon a municipality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Remedy of Quasi Contract against Municipality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The general rule denying implied contractual liability against municipalities, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  barring recovery where the use of the remedy of quasi contract would thwart the purpose of the statutory provisions relating to the manner of making a contract binding upon a municipality, does not apply to plaintiffs' claims against defendants municipalities arising from the discharge of untreated sewage from a joint municipal sewage plant onto plaintiffs' lands since defendants have the power to &quot;take real * * * property within and without the limits of the city * * * for any public or municipal purpose&quot; (General City Law, &sect; 20, subd 2) and &quot;to pay or compromise claims equitably payable by the city though not constituting obligations legally binding on it&quot; (General City Law, &sect; 20, subd 5) and, allowing recovery does not thwart the intent of the Eminent Domain Procedure Law &quot;to give due regard to * * * the legitimate interests of private owners * * * and the quality of the environment&quot; (Eminent Domain Procedure Law, &sect; 101), and, in any event, the claim is implied contract arising out of tort rather than contract.  Accordingly, plaintiffs' cause of action alleging that defendants have been unjustly enriched by dumping sewage and other substances on plaintiffs' property is sustained.</SPAN></P>

The alleged improper operation and maintenance of a joint municipal sewage plant allegedly causing pollution of a nearby creek and the air in the vicinity of the plant and to plaintiffs' property does not give rise to a cause of action against defendants municipalities for breach of public trust, under which doctrine a governmental body is deemed to hold title to navigable waters and tidelands in trust, subject to the rights held by the public of fishing and access for navigation, since the body of water involved is not a navigable waterway, there is no allegation of interference with the public's right to fish or with the public's right of access for navigation, or that the land under the creek has been improperly alienated and plaintiffs had failed to show that the &quot;public trustees&quot; have not used the resources for the benefit of the public.  Plaintiffs' conclusionary allegation of breach of trust and detriment to the public does not warrant an expansion of the public trust doctrine to include all natural resources owned by any governmental body since the judicial creation of standards to define expanded trustee duties would&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  improperly entwine the courts in review and reformation of executive policy.</SPAN></P>

In accordance with the policy of promoting a prompt disposition of class action status early in the litigation ( CPLR 902), defendants municipalities are allowed to contest on the merits plaintiffs' motion for an order allowing the action, based on the discharge of untreated sewage from a joint municipal sewage plant onto plaintiffs' property, to be maintained as a class action before the time for defendants to serve a responsive pleading has expired.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceedings, petitioners sought a judgment directing respondent insurance department to rescind the regulations supplementary to the Comprehensive Automobile Insurance Regulations Act as contained in N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 11, &sect; 65.16 and declaring said regulation void; and further declaring N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 671 et seq. to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners argued that the fee schedule was unreasonable. In support of their contention, they sought to demonstrate that the scheduled fees were considerably less than average attorney's fees, and less than necessary for an attorney to run a law office. In opposition, the insurance department indicated that in formulating the fee schedule at issue it took into consideration the following factors: the complexity and/or novelty of the legal issues involved; the time spent; the amount recovered; the skill necessary and the risk of litigation versus a flat fee. The court held that N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 11, &sect; 65.16(c)(7)(ix), which attempted to prevent an attorney from receiving fees from his client in excess of those permitted to be paid by the insurer was beyond the scope of and inconsistent with both the enabling legislation and the declared application of the regulations. Accordingly, &sect; 65.16(c)(7)(ix) was clearly invalid and was to be rescinded by the insurance department. The petitioners were in all other respects denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A regulation of the State Insurance Department which, in limiting the attorneys' fees for services necessarily performed in the resolution of no-fault disputes, attempts to prevent an attorney from receiving fees from his client in excess of those fees to be paid by the insurer which unreasonably fails to make prompt payment on a valid claim (11 NYCRR 65.16 [c] [7] [ix]), is beyond the scope of and inconsistent with both the enabling legislation, which only authorizes the department to regulate the attorney's fees to which the claimant shall be &quot;entitled to recover&quot; from the no-fault carrier (Insurance Law, &sect; 675, subd 1), and the declared application of the regulatory scheme to only payments &quot;by insurers of applicant's attorney's fees&quot; (11 NYCRR 65.16 [c] [7]), and is thus invalid and must be rescinded.</SPAN></P>

The People argued that the ordinance was clear and that its meaning was understandable. The court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint, finding that the complaint was fatally defective. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional but that it failed to proscribe the conduct charged to defendant. As such, the ordinance was unenforceable against him. The court found that the acts listed in the ordinance were exclusive and that unless the acts of defendant came within the purview of the enumerated acts, a prosecution would not lie. There was no reference in the ordinance to the operation of a refrigeration unit or any mechanical or electronic equipment. The court determined that defendant did not have notice of the proscribed conduct because the ordinance did not include a provision referencing mechanical equipment. The court noted that the law could not rest upon subjective guidelines. Or subject defendant to penal consequences without informing him of the nature of the offense prohibited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being arrested and charged for snatching a victim's handbag, respondent moved that a juvenile delinquency petition not be marked &quot;a designated felony act petition&quot; and that all references in the petition to the charge of grand larceny in the third degree as a designated felony be deleted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent snatched a victim's handbag. The juvenile delinquency petition alleged that his acts would have constituted the crime of grand larceny in the third degree if committed by an adult and also alleged a designated felony act pursuant to N.Y. Family Ct. Act &sect; 712(h), para. 5, due to respondent's two prior felony findings. Respondent moved that the petition not be marked as such and that all references in the petition to the grand larceny charge as a designated felony be deleted. The court found that respondent did not sustain his burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in proving the unconstitutionality of &sect; 712(h), para. 5. Thus, the status as a designated felony act petition and the district attorney's appearance in support of such a petition, pursuant to N.Y. Family Ct. Act &sect;&sect; 712(h), 731(2) and 254-a, were held as constitutional. This was so despite the Family Court Judge being given notice of the prior felony findings, since federal case law precedent recognized that such judges were capable of discerning the proper weight of hearsay evidence before them.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Juvenile Delinquency -- &quot;Designated Felony Act Petition&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Family Court procedures under the Juvenile Justice Reform Amendment of 1978 (L 1978, ch 478) requiring a juvenile delinquency petition to be stamped as a &quot;designated felony act petition&quot; where the respondent juvenile had two previous felony findings (Family Ct Act, &sect; 712, subd [h], par [v]; &sect; 731, subd 2) and permitting the District Attorney to appear in support thereof (Family Ct Act, &sect; 254-a), do not unconstitutionally prejudice respondent's defense at the fact-finding hearing by notifying the Judge of prior felony findings in advance of an adjudication of delinquency since Family Court Judges are capable of exercising that discretion necessary to give proper weight to hearsay evidence which comes before them at fact finding.  The fact that probation reports are not to be seen by the fact-finding Judge until a finding has been made (Family Ct Act, &sect; 750, subd 1) does not require that evidence of prior findings be likewise excluded from the fact finder's purview since the exclusionary rule is only intended to prevent the fact finder from considering&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the wide range of hearsay material contained in the probation file, concerning a juvenile respondent's history and background, which is admissible at dispositional hearings, but not at fact finding and is not intended to exclude evidence of past findings per se.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Juvenile Delinquency -- &quot;Designated Felony Act Petition&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent juvenile has not sustained his burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of showing that the procedures of stamping a juvenile delinquency petition as a &quot;designated felony act petition&quot; in predicate felony cases and the appearance of the District Attorney in support of such petition (Family Ct Act, &sect; 712, subd [h]; &sect; 731, subd 2; &sect; 254-a) are unconstitutional.  A legislative act carries a strong presumption of constitutionality and courts of first instance should not declare such an act unconstitutional except in rare cases where life and liberty is involved and the invalidity of the act is apparent on its face and the conclusion of unconstitutionality is inescapable. </SPAN></P>
