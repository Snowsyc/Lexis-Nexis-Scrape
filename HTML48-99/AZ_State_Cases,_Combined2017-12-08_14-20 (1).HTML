<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff faculty member challenged the order of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which on the motion to reconsider brought by defendant university and its president, rejected the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel and ruled that the faculty member had willfully abandoned his employment with the university as a matter of law. The board cross-appealed from the denial of its request for attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The faculty member filed his action based on 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, the United States Constitution, and state contract law contending that his termination at the university was in retaliation for his exercise of the right of freedom of speech. The state superior court granted the board's motion for reconsideration of its refusal to dismiss the faculty member's complaint, and the faculty member appealed. The court held that: (1) the motion to reconsider was not an attempt to bring an impermissible &quot;horizontal appeal;&quot; (2) the trial judge properly reconsidered the motion for summary judgment because the motion for reconsideration raised issues that the board had not had an opportunity to address; (3) Ariz. Board of Regents Ordinance &sect; 7-207 mandated the form of the contract and not the time limit within which the faculty member's response was due; (4) the issue of promissory estoppel was a factual issue that could not be resolved on a motion for summary judgment; and (5) the court was without subject matter jurisdiction to address the board's argument regarding the propriety of the trial court's reinstatement of the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of theft by extortion pursuant to &sect; 13-1804. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1804(A)(8) was unconstitutionally vague and that the statute provided a real, credible and substantial threat of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Section 13-1804(A)(8) was unconstitutionally vague both because it provided insufficient guidance to those who must make demands on others, and because it permitted arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Not only did ambiguity exist as to what was a legitimate directive for someone like defendant, but also the statute had a chilling effect on expression by others in the political world. Therefore, &sect; 13-1804(A)(8) significantly jeopardized first amendment expression for those not before the court. The legislature had to narrowly draw a statute if it wished to prohibit political intimidation. The court left to the legislature the task of narrowing &sect; 13-1804(A)(8) with such specificity to cover conduct which was within the legislature's power to prohibit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital sought reimbursement from appellee county for services provided to the patient, who was allegedly indigent under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-297(B)(2). The county denied the claim and the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) granted the county's motion for summary judgment. The hospital appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the value of the separate property of the patient's wife exceeded the statutory maximum, the county determined that the patient was not &quot;indigent&quot; and was therefore not eligible for county health services. The county denied the hospital's claim for reimbursement of the patient's hospitalization charges. The court determined that the &quot;resources of all persons in the household&quot; unmistakably indicated an intent to include a spouse's separate property. No limitation of the type of resources, separate or community, was expressed in the statute. The court also held that the regulation did not lack sufficient rationality to satisfy the requirements of due process. It was not, however, irrational that the legislature expect that those possessing sufficient separate assets would voluntarily pay for a spouse's necessary medical care, nor did the regulation effect a taking of the hospital's property without just compensation. The state did not &quot;invade&quot; the hospital, but simply required hospitals, as a condition of doing business in Arizona, to accept emergency patients without regard to their ability to pay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was awaiting trial on armed robbery and was granted his motion to waive counsel and proceed pro se, with a public defender to act as his advisory counsel. The prisoner filed a motion seeking, among other things, a court order allowing him physical access to a law library instead of the paging system whereby he had to request legal research. The motion was denied. The prisoner then brought a special action to the court, alleging he was denied his constitutional right of access to the courts to prepare his defense. Specifically, he challenged the &quot;paging system&quot; in use to provide inmates with legal research by use of a paralegal instead of a an attorney. The court found the use of a paralegal instead of an attorney in the paging system was not a constitutional deprivation because the paralegal could help direct the prisoner's legal research in the same way an attorney would. Because the paging system was not constitutionally infirm, there was no obligation to transfer the prisoner to a prison where he would have physical access to the courts. Finally, there was no unconstitutional denial of supplies, and the prisoner was not entitled to a typewriter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment and sentence of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which convicted him, after a jury trial, of one count of fraudulent schemes and artifices, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2310, 10 counts of submitting fraudulent insurance claims, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-1220, and onr count of theft, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1802.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered into a scheme that obtained reimbursement under Medicare, Part B, for ineligible services. Defendant billed Medicare by charging for other, approved treatments. The state alleged that the overall scheme constituted the fraudulent schemes and artifices charge. He was also charged with 10 counts of submitting fraudulent insurance claims, and a theft count. A jury convicted him of all of the charges, and the trial court enhanced his theft sentence based on the fraudulent insurance claims convictions. On appeal, the court reversed the convictions for fraudulent insurance claims. Medicare Part B was not a contract of insurance, which was a required element of a fraudulent insurance claim pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-1220. The court affirmed the fraudulent schemes and artifices conviction, and the theft conviction, but vacated the sentences, and remanded for resentencing. The theft conviction was no longer subject to an enhanced sentence without the previous conviction. The court vacated the proper sentence on the fraudulent schemes because it appeared the erroneous belief that the theft conviction required an enhanced sentence may also have affected that sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the defendant's convictions on 10 counts of submitting fraudulent insurance claims. The sentence on the theft count that was enhanced based on the convictions for submitting fraudulent insurance claims was set aside. Although the conviction and sentence on the fraudulent schemes and artifices count was valid, the sentence was set aside and the matter was remanded for resentencing on both convictions.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-846(F) (Supp. 1988), the putative father's request for a jury trial in a paternity action filed against him by real party in interest, the State of Arizona. The court accepted special action jurisdiction to consider the putative father's claim that &sect; 12-846(F) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed a paternity action against the putative father, who requested a jury trial. The trial court denied the request. Upon accepting special action jurisdiction, the court denied the putative father's request for a jury trial. The court concluded that &sect; 12-846(F) did not abrogate a statutory right to a jury trial in paternity actions because no such right existed when it was enacted. The court held that Ariz. Const. art II, &sect; 23, which preserved the right to a jury trial in those actions in which the right existed at common law when the state constitution was adopted in 1910, did not render &sect; 12-846(F)&nbsp;unconstitutional because no common law right to a jury trial in paternity actions existed in 1910. Finally, the court held that Ariz. Const. art. IV, pt. 2, &sect; 13, which required that a legislative act's title set forth the act's purpose, did not render &sect; 12-846(F) void. Although the title of &sect; 12-846(F) did not state that it required paternity actions to be tried to the court, this did not change existing law, and therefore it was not necessary for the bill's title to provide notice of &sect; 12-846(F)'s purpose.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and held that the statute was not vague in its use of the word &quot;unlawfully&quot; where that term was a word of common usage. The term did not need to be specifically defined in an instruction or statute as it was generally understood to denote an act done without authorization.Further, no jury instruction was necessary to define the terms &quot;licensed, authorized or otherwise privileged&quot; because those terms were commonly understood by the average person without a dictionary. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to prove defendant's intent where he remained in the store after concealing the jeans because it was clear that he intended to steal the two pair of jeans by putting them on under his own trousers in the fitting room.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was engaged in cattle ranching. Its cattle grazed on open range territory. The husband was driving his motorcycle in open range territory. A heifer owned by the company suddenly crossed in front of the husband. A collision resulted in which the heifer was killed and the husband suffered injuries. Appellants argued that the superior court erred in not finding that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-502 was unconstitutional. They alleged that &sect; 24-502 violated Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect;31, as well as Ariz. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 6. In affirming, the court found that the threshold question was whether any cause of action existed in 1910 when the constitution was adopted because common law rights and remedies existing at the time of the adoption of the constitution were preserved. The court concluded that no cause of action existed at the time the constitution was adopted. Thus, the two constitutional provisions were inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for attempted molestation of a child and dangerous crimes against children in the second degree entered by the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) upon defendant's guilty plea. Defendant also sought review of his sentence to 15 years of imprisonment and to lifetime parole upon his release from prison pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604.01(I).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his guilty plea was involuntary because he was not advised that he would not be entitled to early release credits pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 41-1604.06 and 41-1604.07. Defendant also argued that the trial court improperly imposed lifetime parole. On appeal, the court determined that the imposition of lifetime parole was not impossible to enforce and did not violate separation of powers as defendant was convicted of dangerous crimes against children in the second degree. Because defendant was eligible for release after serving half of his sentence, if he were to violate parole, he could have been returned to prison to serve the balance of his sentence. The trial court's imposition of lifetime parole did not invade the province of the Arizona Board of Pardons and Paroles as the Board retained discretion on whether to release defendant on parole at all. The court found that the trial court did not commit reversible error by failing to inform defendant that he was ineligible for early release credits as he was clearly informed of the earliest release date and the maximum sentence possible as a result of the plea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court accepted jurisdiction pursuant to Ariz. R. P. for Special Actions 1(a) over the special action of petitioner corporation against respondents, the superior court and the union that was the real party in interest. The petition for special action concerned the adequacy of the supersedeas bond fixed by the trial court to stay the execution of the unconditional money judgment rendered by a jury against the union.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation filed an action against the union.

The union subsequently filed a motion to stay enforcement of judgment . The trial court set a supersedeas bond in the amount of $ 250,000.00. The corporation filed a petition seeking relief. The court accepted jurisdiction because there was no adequate remedy by appeal to correct the alleged error of the trial court. Ariz. R. P. for Special Actions 1(a). The court found that the judgment was not secured by the bond fixed because the trial court erred in fixing the supersedeas bond in an amount substantially less than the judgment. The court also found that the trial court failed to provide a hearing to explore the alternatives to a supersedeas bond. The court, therefore, granted relief and remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

Appellants argued that the jury was incorrectly instructed on the subject of contributory negligence, opposing counsel's comments during closing argument were improper and prejudicial, and evidentiary rulings by the trial court were improperly restrictive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At appellants' request, the superior court gave R.A.J.I. Negligence Instruction 5. Appellants did not object to the inclusion of the bracketed portion of the instruction in the charge. On appeal, the court held that appellants in effect stipulated to the instruction, and there was no fundamental error permitting them to inject the issue before the court. The court held that, by using the word &quot;companies&quot; in closing argument, appellees' counsel made an indefensible reference to insurance. But, appellants neither objected during or at the conclusion of oral argument, nor requested a curative instruction, nor moved for mistrial. Thus, they waived the chance to raise the misconduct on appeal. The court held that the admissions of appellees' counsel in another personal injury case brought by the wife were admissible in the superior court trial under Ariz. R. Civ. P. 81(d)(2)(D). The superior court excluded the evidence in the interest of judicial economy. The court held that, because the record submitted by appellants did not include the relevant transcript, the court had to assume that the evidence supported the trial judge's determinations. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment. The city and the employee did not properly preserve their issues for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following judgment for appellee garnishor against defendant debtor, the garnishor sought garnishment from appellant garnishee, which allegedly owed money to the debtor for plumbing work. The trial court, after a hearing, held that the garnishee owed money to the debtor, who owed money to the garnishor. Judgment of garnishment was entered for the garnishor. On appeal, the court affirmed the ruling, finding that the garnishee's debt to the debtor was not a contingent debt merely because it was disputed, because the debtor's work for the garnishee was substantially completed. The debt was liquidated, as evidenced by the contract, invoices, and accountings upon which the trial court determined the parties' obligations. Due process was not denied the garnishee, as both it and the debtor had notice of the hearings and issues, and had an opportunity to present evidence. The court remanded the exclusion of one back charge claimed by the garnishee, even though it was offered after the writ was served, as it arose out of the contract at issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A businessman marketed a home video course on how to become a millionaire. The state filed a consumer fraud and racketeering complaint against the businessman alleging that he had falsely and deceptively represented the course to consumers, falsified income information, operated an illegal enterprise, and failed to pay state sales tax. The court held that both the state's proof and the trial court's findings fell short of what was constitutionally required to sustain an injunction of the course. The state never placed the course itself before the trial court, and it failed to establish that the course was entirely commercial speech. In fact, portions of the course were non-commercial, motivational, or informative, and therefore the preliminary and permanent injunctions banning the course were unconstitutional. Summary judgment for the state on consumer fraud grounds was proper where the course promotions and advertisements, as deceptive commercial speech, lacked First Amendment protection. However, in the absence of undisputed evidence of the requisite intent, there was an insufficient basis for the award of summary judgment on the racketeering and forfeiture charges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the injunctions and reversed the grant of summary judgment based on racketeering and forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

He was a 16-year-old at the time, and was found to have fondled a 14-year-old girl's breasts with her consent. The juvenile argued to the trial court that &sect; 13-1404 was unconstitutional as applied to him and other juveniles. His argument was that while the statute was clear as applied to adults, it was unconstitutional as applied to juveniles engaged in consensual sexual activity. The court found that the plain language of &sect; 13-1404 prohibited the conduct engaged in by the juvenile. The statute was not vague nor was it overbroad. Therefore, the trial court acted correctly in finding that the admitted violation of the statute justified the revocation of the juvenile's probation and his commitment to the Department of Corrections.</SPAN></P>

Before accepting the admission, the trial court obtained the concurrence of the father in the plea, advised the juvenile of his constitutional rights, and determined that the admission was knowing, voluntary, intelligent, and had a factual basis. The trial court found the juvenile to be delinquent. The trial court placed the juvenile on intensive probation in his parents' custody. The trial court also ordered his driver's license be suspended until his eighteenth birthday pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-249(D) (1988). On appeal from the license suspension, the court affirmed the order. The court ruled that &sect; 8-249(D) did not violate the juvenile's equal protection rights because it was reasonably related to the legitimate state purposes of discouraging juvenile drug abuse and keeping them off of the roads. The court also ruled that the juvenile system had adequate safeguards to satisfy due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Superior Court of Yavapai County (Arizona), which imposed consecutive sentences for the separately charged offenses for which defendant was convicted. Defendant had pled no contest to hit and run, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-661, manslaughter, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1103, aggravated assault, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1204, assault, Ariz. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving his car and struck four teenagers who were walking alongside the road. He fled the scene without rendering aid. One of the victims died, a second was seriously injured, and the other two were less severely injured. There was evidence that defendant was extremely intoxicated at the time of the accident. He entered a plea of no contest to hit and run, manslaughter, aggravated assault, assault, and endangerment. Sentences of varying lengths were imposed, and each sentence was to be consecutive to all other sentences. Defendant was sentenced to a total term of 21.7 years of imprisonment. On appeal, defendant contended that the imposition of consecutive sentences in this case constituted a violation of the state and federal double jeopardy clauses as well as a violation of Arizona's double punishment statute because he was being punished with consecutive sentences for his single act of recklessness. The court found that for purposes of the state and federal double jeopardy clauses, the term &quot;offense&quot; referred to the result of the act rather than the act itself; thus, a defendant could be charged with each and every criminal result flowing from his single act.</SPAN></P>

Defendant molested the young girl and deserted both children at the lake. Defendant was charged with kidnapping, interference with child custody, and child molesting. The trial court dismissed the child molesting counts on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction, and defendant was convicted of interference with child custody. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions. Defendant was not a parent for purposes of the interference with child custody statute set forth in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1302, even though he was the child's biological father, because following his termination of parental rights, he had no parental custodial interest assertable in the trial court. Thus, defendant was not entitled to have the conviction reduced to a class six felony. The state violated defendant's right of confrontation by admitting the child's testimony by videotaped deposition; however, this error was harmless because the testimony was cumulative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Superior Court of Cochise County (Arizona), which convicted him of one count of trafficking in stolen property and one count of transferring marijuana to a minor under the age of 15 years. Defendant had admitted to a prior felony conviction. The trial court imposed the maximum sentence, 21 years for the trafficking and 25 years for the marijuana sale; the sentences were to run consecutively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A 14-year-old boy informed the police that he had stolen a gun and later gave it to defendant to sell for him. He also told the police he bought marijuana from defendant on two prior occasions. Defendant was the older brother of one of the juvenile's friends. While in defendant's backyard, the juvenile gave defendant's brother $ 1, and the brother bought a marijuana cigarette from defendant, which the two juveniles smoked. On a second occasion, the juvenile gave the money directly to defendant. Defendant was convicted of trafficking in stolen property and for the second sale of marijuana. On appeal, he contended that the 25-year sentence imposed for selling marijuana to a minor violated his right against cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII and XIV. The court disagreed, finding that selling drugs to a minor under age 15 was a dangerous crime against children under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604.01, and that under the statute, defendant was required to be sentenced to a presumptive term of imprisonment for 20 years. The court found that the trial judge properly imposed the additional five-year sentence because of the defendant's lengthy criminal record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, adult bookstore and its owner, sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which convicted them of production, publication, sale, or possession of an obscene film, in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3502 (1978). The judgment of conviction also ordered appellants to forfeit their permits and licenses, including a city license for running a video center and a patent medicine license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged their convictions under the Arizona obscenity statute, arguing that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the meaning of the term &quot;prurient interest&quot; as used in the Arizona obscenity statute. The court agreed with appellants that the term &quot;prurient interest&quot; could not encompass normal, healthy sexual interests, and determined that the trial court properly did not include references to &quot;lust&quot; or &quot;lustful desires&quot; in the instructions. The court affirmed the convictions, but vacated the term of probation imposed. The trial court, as a condition of probation, ordered appellants to forfeit any licenses issued to either of them. The court rejected the state's argument that the forfeiture was merely punishment for past behavior, holding that a statute must be analyzed as to its effect and that the effect of forfeiting the video store license was to restrain the dissemination of all materials, those protected under U.S. Const. amend. I as well as those that were obscene. The court held that forfeiture of the patent medicine license did not act as prior restraint because appellants could continue to sell protected materials even without this license.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the obscenity convictions of the adult bookstore and its owner, but vacated the term of probation and remanded with instructions that the trial court impose probation in a manner consistent with the court's opinion that requiring the forfeiture of the video store license acted as an unlawful prior restraint on protected speech, although forfeiture of the patent medicine license was not an impermissible prior restraint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff water company appealed a decision from the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which affirmed the decision of defendant Arizona Department of Water Resources (DWR), which denied the water company's applications for Type Two non-irrigation grandfathered water rights under the Groundwater Code, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 45-462 (1956).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The water company sought Type Two non-irrigation water rights, but were denied by the DWR. The water company sought judicial review, and the trial court affirmed the decision of the DWR. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that the water company was not entitled to the water rights because it did not come within the purview of &sect; 45-464(C). The court found that the word &quot;includes&quot; in that section operated as a word of limitation, and that any &quot;non-irrigation user&quot; meant someone other than a city, town, or private water company. The fact that one of the water company's wells was located within its service area as defined by the Groundwater Code, but outside its certificated area, as defined by the Arizona Corporation Commission (commission), did not render &sect;&sect; 45-402(26)(b), 45-464&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court found nothing in the definition of &quot;service area&quot; under the Groundwater Code conflicted with the grant of power to the commission under Ariz. Const. art. XV, &sect; 3. The court held that the DWR did not perform a taking because the water company still pumped water under its service area rights.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 13-1410, and sentenced him to a mitigated term of 12 years in prison, the minimum term permitted for the offense. Defendant appealed from both his conviction and his sentence. The court reviewed evidence in the record that showed that defendant approached the eight-year-old victim, made promises to her and her parent, and invited her alone into an apartment where he pulled down her pants and touched her vagina. The court found no error in the admission at trial of evidence of the victim's character, Ariz. R. Evid. 608, because the impeachment of the victim by inconsistent statements put her truthfulness in issue. The state's rehabilitation of the victim with character evidence was proper. The court also ruled that the jury instructions taken as a whole correctly instructed the jury as to the burden of proof. To determine whether the sentence violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, the court applied the three-prong test and found that defendant's sentence was constitutional.

The court found that &sect;&sect; 14-3801 and 3803 were unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause because they allowed claims of readily ascertainable creditors to be barred after giving notice only by publication.

An Indian tribe filed a motion to intervene because it was believed that the mother was of Indian ancestry. The mother was granted custody of her oldest child, but ultimately DES filed a petition to terminate the mother's parental rights as to her younger two children. The trial court granted the petition, and the mother appealed, asserting that the trial court lacked jurisdiction, that placement of her children outside of the home was improper and in violation of the Indian Child Welfare Act, and state statutes regarding termination were unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was stopped for a traffic violation and the smell of alcohol was observed on his breath.

His driver's license was then revoked for two years pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-249. The juvenile challenged the constitutionality of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-249, because it purported to extend the juvenile court's jurisdiction beyond age 18 by authorizing a two year license revocation.

The court accepted the juvenile's second argument, however, and vacated the license revocation. The court held that the legislature did not intend to make driving unintoxicated but with minute amounts of alcohol in the body grounds for suspending a juvenile's driver's license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to the trial court's preliminary injunction enjoining the city from enforcing or implementing its annexation of an unincorporated area, the city sought, and the court accepted, special action jurisdiction because the issue was one of law with statewide significance. The trial court had granted the motion for injunctive relief filed by the garbage collection agencies, after finding that the city's annexation was an unconstitutional &quot;taking&quot; of their business interests without just compensation, in violation of Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17. Under special action jurisdiction, the court determined that the enactment of an annexation ordinance that complied with statutory requirements was not in and of itself confiscatory. The court pointed out that the mere acquisition of the right to exercise governmental powers pursuant to the annexation ordinance did not itself constitute a &quot;taking&quot; of property because some additional act of the city in the exercise of that power had to be undertaken. The court therefore reversed the trial court's order enjoining the annexation and directed the trial court to enter an order quashing the preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which convicted him of aggravated assault and sentenced him to 11.25 years imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of aggravated assault and assessed a punishment of 11.25 years imprisonment. Defendant's trial counsel withdrew after trial and defendant obtained new counsel for the appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant failed to raise any objection to a deaf juror at trial and therefore did not preserve the issue for appeal. The court stated that evidence indicated the juror was capable of understanding the evidence and the trial court's failure to disqualify the deaf juror sua sponte did not constitute fundamental error. The court rejected a contention that testimony could have been inaccurately translated by the deaf juror's interpreter and stated common law provided that deaf persons were not necessarily incompetent jurors and were as capable of understanding technical testimony. The court further held inclusion of the juror was consistent with legislative intent to eliminate discrimination based on handicaps.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, defendant State appealed orders from the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff retirement system fund manager (fund manager) as to whether it had complied with the provisions of the Arizona Procurement Code (code), Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 41-2501 to -2652 (Supp. 1987), and dismissed the State's action against plaintiff law firm, the fund manager's outside counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an initial matter, the court rejected the fund manager's contention that the State, through its attorney general, lacked &quot;standing&quot; to challenge the constitutionality of the state law that amended the code. The court noted that in the present case, the attorney general was acting pursuant to a specific grant of authority; therefore, the fund manager's motion to dismiss for lack of standing was denied. Turning to the merits of the appeal, the court then found that the only reasonable interpretation of 1987 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 180 (SB 1098) was that contracts for goods and services approved by the fund manager, such as the agreement between it and the law firm, were retroactively exempted from the requirements of the code. Thus, the fund manager was not in violation of the code, as the State contended, and was entitled to summary judgment in its favor. The court further found no merit in any of the specific constitutional challenges to the adequacy of SB 1098 and concluded that the law impaired no constitutionally protected vested rights. Accordingly, the court affirmed the summary judgment and dismissed the other appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the entry of summary judgment in favor of the fund manager and accordingly dismissed the appeal of the dismissal of the State's action to recover allegedly illegal payments of public monies made to the law firm by the fund manager.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants state and city appealed an order of the Pima County Superior Court (Arizona), which granted the motion of plaintiff passengers to strike their affirmative defense. The passengers had sought to recover for injuries sustained in a car accident and alleged that the road was negligently maintained. The defendants had asserted that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-820.03(2) precluded liability for certain injuries attributable to a drunk driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Where injuries were partially attributable to a drunk driver, &sect; 12-820.03(2) barred any claim by the driver or his adult passengers against a public entity. The trial court held that &sect; 12-820.03(2) violated Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 6, which barred abrogation of the right to recover damages for injuries. The trial court found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-820.03(2) required a plaintiff to overcome practically insurmountable defenses given the number of uninsured drunk drivers. On appeal the court reversed. Because the passengers' right of action did not exist at the time the constitution was adopted, it was not protected by Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 6. Also, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-820.03(2) did not abrogate a negligence claim by creating insurmountable hurdles for those whose injuries were partially attributable to a drunk driver. The passengers could prove that the driver was not drunk or that the accident was not his fault. In addition, &sect; 12-820.03(2) did not violate equal protection under Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 13. The classification created by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-820.03(2) was reasonably related to deterring drunk driving and avoiding extensive public expense due to drunk driving.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that granted the passengers' motion to strike and its finding the statute was unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, city and city council, sought review of the judgment from the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which ruled in favor of appellee citizens in their action seeking to set aside Phoenix. Ariz., Ordinance G-2700, by which over nine square miles were annexed by the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council enacted Ordinance G-2700, annexing approximately 9.49 square miles. The citizens filed a petition to set aside the annexation, claiming that the annexation statute was unconstitutional and that Ordinance G-2700 was adopted in violation of the Open Meeting Law, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 38-431 to 38-431.09. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the citizens, declaring the annexation statute unconstitutional. On appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court found the statute to be constitutional and remanded the case to the trial court. After remand, the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the citizens on the Open Meeting Law violation. On appeal, the court found that the city failed to satisfy the agenda requirement of the Open Meeting Law, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-431.02, which provided that at least 24 hours prior to the meeting, the city had to provide the public with an agenda listing the specific matters to be discussed. The court then found that the information provided to the public failed to indicate that an additional tract would be annexed. The court concluded that the notice was, at best, confusing and may have actually been misleading.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, by entering into the contract, the city had not engaged in regulation, but had instead acted lawfully pursuant to its home rule charter and its police powers. The fact that one party to the contract was a municipal corporation did not convert that agreement into regulation. The court held that the city had not undertaken to regulate in the area of ambulances and ambulance services. The contract was in compliance with the laws of Arizona and the rules and regulations of DHS. Because the city had not undertaken to regulate, it followed that DHS could not be said to have delegated regulatory power. Furthermore, DHS had maintained control over all important aspects of ambulances and ambulance services, including issuance of certificates of necessity and the fixing of minimum rates and response times.

The Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) granted a motion for judgment on the pleadings on grounds that any action against the manufacturer and distributor was barred by the statute of limitations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent suffered a fatal reaction to a sulfite agent used by the restaurant.

The second amended complaint was filed more than two years after the decedent's death. The court held that the cause of action &quot;accrued&quot; when the survivors discovered or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered that they were injured by a particular defendant's negligent conduct. The cause of action did not accrue until the survivors knew or should have known of both elements of causation, what and who caused the injury.

The trial court granted defendants summary judgment. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was accepted by defendants as a police officer. But while at the academy his blood pressure was found to exceed academy regulations. The applicant was disqualified.  29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 794 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Act) prohibited discrimination against otherwise qualified handicapped person in federally funded programs. The employee argued that defendants perceived his hypertension as a handicap under the Act, and that except for the perceived handicap the applicant could perform his job. The court found that those allegations stated a cause of action under the Act. The fact that the city was merely following state law in denying the employment did not free the city from liability. Compliance with state law was not a valid defense when certification was conditioned on otherwise discriminatory practices. The trial court properly dismissed the wrongful discharge and breach of contract claims. State law required that police receive state certification. But the employee failed to complete the course required for certification, and thus the city was forced to discharge him as a police officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a special action review, petitioners, city and its workmen's compensation carrier (carrier), appealed a decision by respondent Industrial Commission (commission) (Arizona) that excused respondent claimant's late protest and awarded worker's compensation benefits to the claimant who was a prisoner and was injured while working for the state under an intergovernmental agreement with the state corrections department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant injured his back when assisting in garbage collection while on a work release program from prison. The intergovernmental agreement between the state corrections department and the city was authorized under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-124.01(B) and required the city to pay a set salary for prisoner labor. The carrier had denied compensation because the claimant was not a city employee. It mailed a notice to his last known address and made no other effort to locate him. When the claimant was released from prison, he filed a late protest. On appeal, the court set aside the award for the claimant. The court reasoned that the commission properly excused the late filing because of the carrier's failure to make a reasonable effort to notify the claimant. However, the claimant was being compensated under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-254(I) and thus, the exclusion of worker's compensation benefits under that section also applied to the claimant. The statute was constitutional because although the legislature had authority to extend compensation coverage to prisoners, the mandatory coverage for public employment did not extend to prisoners who did manual labor for a city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the worker's compensation award granted in favor of the claimant. The court held that the statutory exclusion of worker's compensation coverage to prisoners was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 28-102(A)(1), which defined &quot;resident&quot; for purposes of registering and operating a vehicle in Arizona, violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and unconstitutionally burdened the right to travel. Defendant argued that the residency definition violated the Equal Protection Clause because the State failed to show that the statute promoted any compelling state interest. The court disagreed and affirmed and held that the residency requirement was not a durational residency statute. It did not discriminate between old and new residents, and, thus, did not violate equal protection. The court found that the statute required all residents to register their vehicles and to obtain licenses. Further, Arizona had the right to prescribe reasonable, uniform, vehicle registration and licensing requirements because they were necessary to insure public safety. The court held that defendant was not entitled to a jury trial because the offenses charged were petty offenses. The possible six-months in jail was not so severe as to require a jury trial. The fine imposed was under $ 1,000.</SPAN></P>

The inhabitants contended that the legislation underlying the annexations was unconstitutional. The court held that Ariz. Rev.

The court also held that configuration of the territory annexed in Ahwatukee was not arbitrary or unreasonable, and therefore did not violate due process because it was reasonably related to the legitimate legislative purpose of preventing the creation of &quot;islands&quot; of unincorporated territory that, once created, might forever remain unincorporated. The court also held that the annexation in Ahwatukee did not violate Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-471(G), (H), notwithstanding the provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-471(J).

The court found that the constitutional right to confrontation included, absent some compelling reason otherwise, the right to have the jury observe personally the demeanor of a prosecution witness while testifying. The court held that the trial judge admitted under Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent and the driver were killed in a collision that occurred as the driver was fleeing from city police officers. The survivors filed an action against the tavern for having furnished alcoholic beverages to the driver when he was intoxicated. It also alleged that the city police officers negligently conducted the high-speed chase of the driver immediately before the collision occurred. A jury determined that the driver was 95 percent responsible in the collision, the tavern was 3 percent responsible, and the city was 2 percent responsible. The trial court entered a judgment of joint and several liability against all defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed. Sufficient evidence of the driver's intoxication while being served drinks at the tavern was introduced to warrant denial of the tavern's motion for directed verdict. The police officer's attempt to stop the driver for drunk driving and the driver's reaction was foreseeable and was not an intervening, superseding cause of the decedent's death. The city and the tavern were liable for the full burden of the verdict regardless of the fact that the driver was found to be more comparatively negligent in the collision.</SPAN></P>

The plea agreement required payment of restitution to the victim for economic loss, but did not specify the amount. Defendant was sentenced to 15 years in prison, and ordered to pay restitution of $ 100. After the plea was accepted the Arizona Supreme Court held that a plea had to be set aside if defendant was not informed of the specific amount of restitution that could have been ordered. The court affirmed, finding that the supreme court decision on informing a defendant of the amount of restitution was to be applied prospectively. To determine if a decision was to be applied retroactively or prospectively a court had to consider the purpose to be served by the new standards, the extent of reliance upon the old standards; and the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standard. The court found that the rights of defendants protected by a retroactive application was minimal compared to the relatively high cost to the state if pleas were reversed by retroactive application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted of sexual assault, challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which granted the state's motion to dismiss his second petition for post-conviction relief because it was precluded under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4234(F) (Supp. 1986) in that it was filed more than one year from the date of the mandate in defendant's prior appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1981 defendant was convicted of sexual assault. The trial court denied his petition for post-conviction relief. Thereafter, his timely direct appeal was consolidated with his petition for review. In 1983, the conviction was affirmed on direct appeal and the review was granted, but relief was denied on the petition for post-conviction relief. In 1986, defendant filed the subject petition for post-conviction relief and the state argued for its dismissal under &sect; 13-4234(F) because it was filed more than one year from the date of the mandate in the appeal. Defendant argued that &sect; 13-4234 was unconstitutional because it invaded the rule-making power of the Arizona Supreme Court, which it had been granted under Ariz. Const. art. 6, &sect; 5. The court granted review, granted relief, and held that although the right to post-conviction relief was substantive, the time limits in &sect; 13-4234 were purely procedural. The court further held that the one-year time limit provided for in &sect; 13-4234 was unconstitutional because it was in conflict with Ariz. R. Civ. P. 32 and therefore, unconstitutionally invaded the province of the Arizona Supreme Court's rule-making authority.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's sentence totaled 91 years and was to be served without the possibility of parole, commutation, pardon, work furlough, or other release from confinement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A detective interviewed defendant in his hotel room regarding his behavior towards a minor. Defendant was arrested and read his Miranda rights. Defendant said he understood his rights and consented to a search of his room. The trial court ruled that defendant's statements were in compliance with Miranda and refused to suppress the fruits of the room search. The court affirmed and held that the time officers spent with defendant prior to his arrest was not unconstitutional investigatory detention because no objective indicia of arrest were present. The court held that each of the crimes of which defendant was convicted, child molestation, sexual conduct with a minor under 15, and sexual exploitation of a minor, were specifically defined to provide that they were punishable pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604.01, and it was clear from reading both &sect; 13-604 and &sect; 13-604.01 that &sect; 13-604.01 constituted a separate sentencing scheme for certain types of crimes committed against children under the age of 15. The sentences specified in &sect; 13-604.01 were mandatory, thus, no separate allegation of dangerousness was required, and defendant was properly sentenced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving under the influence and for driving with a blood alcohol content greater than .10 per cent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that an officer did not have authority to issue the tickets because defendant was on private property when the alleged drunk driving incident occurred. Defendant contended that the court lacked jurisdiction because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692 was restricted by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-104 to offenses that occur on a public highway or roadway. Defendant also contended that the application of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692 to private property was unconstitutional because it violates Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 2, &sect; 13. The court held that under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-621 the provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692 applied throughout the state and that there was noting in either statute that restricted jurisdiction in a DUI action to a public highway. The court also held that Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 2, &sect; 13 referred only to titles of acts enacted by the legislature and not to titles of sections or articles in the code. Finally, the court held that there was a compelling state interest in enforcing Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692 on private property because an intoxicated or reckless driver of an automobile on private property was just as much a menace as he was on a public highway.</SPAN></P>

However, Arizona had adopted the public policy of assisting the developmentally disabled by promoting their deinstitutionalization. The court held that Ariz. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state argued that the remedies set forth in Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-2314 were constitutional or had to be interpreted as constitutional. The state also urged that even if some remedies were unconstitutional, the trial court was unjustified in finding that obscenity could not be used as a predicate offense under the state law RICO statutes. Defendants urged that the majority of the RICO remedies were unconstitutional as applied to obscenity and that it made little sense for the court to try to save any of the provisions after excising the unconstitutional portions. Defendants also argued that the crime of illegally conducting an enterprise through obscenity was unconstitutionally vague. The court concluded that the trial court erred in declaring that obscenity could not be used as a predicate offense for RICO prosecutions; and construed RICO as related to a criminal prosecution for obscenity, such that it passed constitutional muster and did not have a chilling effect on protected rights. The court also determined that the state's remedies against obscenity under RICO were more limited than the state's remedies against other forms of racketeering activity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona), which convicted him of two counts of child molestation and sentenced him to consecutive, aggravated prison terms of 20 years for each conviction. Defendant contended that the sentence imposed was excessive and constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was within the statutory range, but defendant argued that the total 40-year sentence was disproportionate to the crime committed. The court found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604.01(B) mandated a presumptive prison term of 17 years for a conviction of child molestation. Section 604.01(J) required that the sentence imposed for each count be consecutive to any other sentence imposed. Under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604.01(D), the 17-year presumptive sentence could be increased or decreased by up to 5 years pursuant to the provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-702. At sentencing, the trial court found the aggravating circumstance of defendant's prior offenses, the prior sexual nature of the offense for which he had been released from prison just before the instant offenses, and his lack of remorse. There was nothing in the record that indicated an abuse of the trial court's sentencing discretion. The court concluded, based upon the gravity of the offense, the harshness of the penalty, the sentences imposed on others in the same jurisdiction, and sentences imposed on others similarly situated, the sentence imposed upon defendant did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The hospital and physician filed special action petitions requesting review of the denial of their motions to quash. The court held that the privilege expressly conferred by Arizona's Peer Review Act (Act), particularly Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-445.01, applied to the credentialing records subpoenaed. The court held that the Act established an evidentiary privilege regulating the negligent supervision claim and did not violate the anti-abrogation clause of Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 6. The court held that the hospital peer review privilege did not invade the rule-making power of the supreme court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, parent and subsidiary, were two corporations that loaned money. One was the parent company of the other. The parent was licensed under the Consumer Loan Act (Act), Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 6-601 et. seq., requiring a set interest rate for borrowers. The subsidiary was not licensed and could set any interest rate agreed between it and real parties in interest borrowers. Borrowers' complaint alleged that the loans made by subsidiary should be attributed to parent based on an alter ego theory. The issue was whether borrowers had a private right of action under the Act. Parent's motion to dismiss based on the ground that the Act did not provide a private action was denied.

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 45-401 to -637. The landowners' property was located with a subsequent irrigation non-expansion area (INA).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act totally banned any increased irrigation in subsequent INAs under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 45-437(B). The landowners argued that they made substantial capital investments in their property for irrigation purposes during appropriate time periods and that the Department's interpretation of &sect; 45-437(B) constituted an unlawful taking of their property. The court disagreed and affirmed. The determination of whether land in a subsequent INA could be irrigated was provided by statute. It required the land to be irrigated during a specific five-year period. It did not require a substantial capital investment for irrigation purposes with no set time limits. The court rejected the landowners' interpretation because it assumed that the legislators negated the five-year limit in the second part of the statute. This would allow irrigation for any land that had been irrigated in the past and was inconsistent with the legislative intent. There was no unlawful taking because the landowners did not own the groundwater under their land. The State of Arizona always had the right to exercise its police power as to the landowners' right to use the groundwater.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the power company. The employer appealed from the summary judgment, arguing that the indemnification statute was unconstitutional.

The power company therefore made no arrangements to prevent the injury, such as the placement of temporary barriers, deenergization of the lines, or temporary relocation of the lines.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state imposed a transaction privilege tax on contracting businesses.

The trial court granted summary judgment to the department; however, on appeal, the court reversed, holding that: 1) the contractor was in the same class as competitors who were excused from the privilege taxes; 2) requiring the contractor to pay taxes not also required of his competitors violated the contractor's equal protection rights; and 3) the remedy for denying the contractor equal treatment was to refund it the additional taxes it paid thereby putting it in an equal position with its favored competitors.</SPAN></P>

The union contended that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1385(B)(13)&nbsp;unconstitutionally violated U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV, and the state's due process and equal protection clauses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union circulated a strike declaration without evidence of a ballot authorizing the strike. The union filed a petition for a temporary restraining order, which the trial court granted. The ranch then filed a claim for injunctive relief, which the trial court granted, finding the strike unlawful. The court affirmed the judgment on appeal. The court found that neither the common law, nor the Fifteenth Amendment conferred an absolute right to strike, and held that the state could have constitutionally required that before the union could have undertaken the strike against the ranch, the strike had to have been authorized by a majority of the workers affected by the strike. The court rejected the union's contention that their due process rights were violated based on the Agricultural Employment Relations Act's lack of guidelines concerning strike votes and bargaining unit composition, as the union had due process through the judicial system. Nor was the statute vague, because a &quot;bargaining unit&quot; was judicially interpreted to have included all the ranch's workers who had been employed for any period of time during the year preceding the strike vote.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two years and eight months after the son's automobile overturned and killed him, his parents brought a wrongful death action against the manufacturer and seller of the automobile. The trial court dismissed the action because of the two-year statute of limitations set forth at Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-542(2). On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order dismissing the case. Section 12-542(2) violated the equal protection provision in the Arizona Constitution because it precluded some plaintiffs from pursuing a cause of action before it had been discovered. The discovery rule applied to wrongful death actions. A genuine issue of material fact existed as to when the parents knew or should have known of the defects in the automobile. Moreover, if the parents' allegations about the manufacturer's concealment of the automobile's defects were true, the manufacturer's actions would also be sufficient to toll the limitation period under the doctrine of fraudulent concealment.</SPAN></P>

Defendants thus argued that their convictions and sentences were void or voidable. The court rejected defendants' contentions and affirmed their convictions, finding that the language of Ariz. Const. art. VI, &sect; 31 did not require the legislature to provide for the appointment of municipal court judges pro tempore nor did it prohibit cities from so providing in their charters. Thus, the court concluded that the city's charter was not in conflict with any constitutional provision nor was in it in conflict with any other provision of law. Additionally, the court rejected the contention that the subject of the appointment of judges pro tempore had been preempted by the legislature, finding that the legislature had not enacted such laws applicable to city courts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the employer as a bus driver. The employer sent a letter to its employees stating that their salaries would be reduced. Rumors began circulating regarding layoffs and the employee went to a meeting where it was determined that the drivers would lose their jobs. The employee became very upset and eventually consulted with two psychiatrists. The employee then filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits, which the industrial commission denied benefits. On review, the court found that the employee had the burden to establish all of the elements of a claim for mental injury under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1043.01(B). Thus, the employee had to show an unexpected or extraordinary stress that was related to his employment that substantially contributed to his mental injury. The court concluded that notice of a possible job loss was not sufficiently unusual to justify benefits for the employee's alleged emotional injury. Therefore, the employee was not entitled to benefits.</SPAN></P>

His job entailed driving vehicles to and from the auction and washing cars. After defendant had been working for about two weeks, a car disappeared from the lot. Police tracked the car to defendant. At trial, defendant claimed that he bought the car from a licensed dealer whom defendant had allegedly met at the auction. His defense at trial was that he neither knew nor had reason to know that the car had been stolen. The trial court instructed the jury that the purchase of stolen property outside the regular course of business permitted a conclusion that the purchaser was aware of the risk that it had been stolen pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2305(3). Defendant was convicted. On appeal, defendant argued that the inference under &sect; 13-2305(3) applied only to a defendant who was a dealer in property and not where the defendant merely purchased from a dealer. The court agreed and reversed. It was error to give the instruction. Although defendant did not object to the instruction at trial, the error was fundamental and the court could not say that the erroneous instruction did not contribute to the guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

After she shot and killed the husband, she received a revised diagnosis of &quot;atypical psychosis.&quot; New medicine was administered and her condition improved. The wife contended that appellees failed to meet an appropriate standard of care in the diagnosis and treatment of the patient's mental condition. The court affirmed. First, the court held that there was no general common law duty to control the acts of another. Second, the court held that the duty to control should not be imposed solely because of the psychiatrist-patient relationship. Third, the relationship between appellees and the patient was completely bereft of any right, opportunity, or ability to control her conduct.

The hearing had been held under a preponderance of the evidence burden of proof standard, not clear and convincing evidence, as required in an involuntary civil commitment for treatment of mental illness hearing. The Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-5101 definition of &quot;incapacitated person&quot; was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court remanded the case for proceedings consistent with its opinion. The court held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-5101 &quot;incapacitated person&quot; was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad; therefore, it would define it to mean that a determination that an adult could not make &quot;responsible decisions concerning his person&quot; and was therefore incompetent, could be made only if the putative ward's decisionmaking process was so impaired that he was unable to care for his personal safety or unable to attend to and provide for such necessities as food, shelter, clothing, and medical care, without which physical injury or illness could occur. The court applied a clear and convincing burden of proof standard.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to four years' probation and to five years' probation, to be served concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the prosecution engaged in improper cross-examination of defendant and &quot;vouched&quot; for the credibility of a State's witness during the first trial. He also contended that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel when, during the second trial, his own lawyer elicited testimony from a police officer about an unrelated drug incident. Finally, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3405(A)(3) because it violated the proscription against disproportionate penalties in U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The court affirmed defendant's conviction because there was no constitutional violation and there was no merit in his contentions. Defendant waived any error in the first trial be failing to raise an objection at trial. Further, the witness's testimony simply demonstrated that the witness had no motive to testify falsely. The court concluded that defendant was not prejudiced by his counsel's examination of a police officer about a &quot;white powder residue&quot; in defendant's car trunk. The evidence clearly supported the guilty verdict on the charge of unlawful transportation of marijuana.</SPAN></P>

The court held that although the city was a political subdivision and that the notice requirements set forth in &sect; 12-821(A) applied to the claimant's action, dismissal under &sect; 12-821(A) was not proper. The court held that the trial court erred in finding that the conduct of the claimant's counsel in failing to file the notice in a timely manner was due to excusable neglect. The court found that once the claimant told her attorney when the accident occurred, the attorney should have known of the claims statute and notice requirement and should have filed the claim before the expiration of the statutory period.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3994 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the order. The court concluded that &sect; 13-3994(D), which had previously been found unconstitutional, was severable from the remainder of the statute and that &sect; 13-3994(B), which provided a procedural safeguard to protect the acquittee's liberty interest, provided an adequate and constitutional basis for the issuance of the trial court's commitment order in the case. The court noted that the Supreme Court of the United States had held that a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity was sufficient foundation for automatic commitment. The court held that because automatic commitment of a defendant to a mental health agency, after a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, was constitutional, the trial court did not err in entering its order committing defendant to the state hospital.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant conceded he had no right to a plea bargain, but argued that he had a procedural right to plea bargain, and that Ariz.

He argued that because the judicial branch of government had the power to promulgate rules of procedure, pursuant to Ariz. Const. art. 6, &sect; 5, it was a violation of the separation of powers doctrine for the legislature to pass a law which infringed upon plea bargaining in a driving while intoxicated case. The State argued that defendant had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 28-692(C). The court agreed and held that only those who were injured by an unconstitutional statute could object to its constitutionality. The court held that defendant was not injured. Nothing appeared in the record to indicate that the prosecutor had any desire to offer a plea agreement different than the one offered and accepted by defendant. The court also held that defendant had no right to a plea agreement, and without such a right, he had no personal stake in any unconstitutional infringement by a statute upon the discretion of the prosecutor.</SPAN></P>

Sess. Laws, 1st Reg. Sess. ch. 278, was constitutional, finding in favor of appellees, Pima County and its officials. The issues were whether the statute impaired contracts, was a local or special law, and violated equal protection or privileges and immunities under the federal and Arizona constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that a state senator's deposition, offered as evidence of both the legislature's intent and individual legislators' mental processes, was erroneously excluded at trial and was necessary to their claim that the statute was an unconstitutional local or special law. The court held there was no error in excluding the evidence because a single legislator was incompetent to testify about legislative intent in passing a law. The court noted that the parties' agreed statement of facts made it unnecessary to make findings on undisputed matters. The court rejected the argument that the statute violated the constitutional prohibition against impairing contracts in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 because the revenue lost by withdrawals from the fire district might make it unable to meet certain contractual obligations. The court pointed out that the statute did not change any obligation to the contracts. The court concluded that the statute affected neither elections nor assessment and collection of taxes, and the legislature could have concluded that the County was the only area that needed immediate relief from abusive practices by fire districts, so there was a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

During an &quot;in-service&quot; workshop on handguns, the fellow employee was negligent in his handling of a firearm that discharged and seriously injured the coworker. The fellow employee's motion for summary judgment was based on &sect; 23-1022 and the 1980 amendment to Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 8. The court agreed with the trial court that the coworker's exclusive remedy was workmen's compensation. The court rejected the coworker's contention that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1022 was unconstitutional as applied to public employees. The court also rejected the argument that the constitutional amendment did not authorize the legislature to enact any statutes limiting public employees who had been negligently injured by a fellow employee in the course of their employment to compensation benefits. The court found that the intention of the legislature and the people who voted for the amendment was to bar double recoveries by all injured workers covered by the Workmen's Compensation Act, whether they were public or private employees.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. tit. 4 and which held that the revocation of the licensees' license was excessive. The trial court also remanded the case to the Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board found that the licensees violated Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 4-244(9), (14), (23); 4-241(A), as well as Ariz. Admin. Code 4-15-234 (1982). Most of the violations involved the presence of underage patrons and underage drinking. The Board recommended revocation of the licensees' license, but the trial court held that revocation was an excessive penalty. The trial court also reversed all of the Board's findings on the ground that reputation and hearsay evidence was admitted. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred as to all but two of the counts against the licensees. The Board's decision as to numerous counts was supported by the evidence, and the trial court could not reweigh the evidence or substitute its findings for that of the Board. Rather, judicial review was limited to deciding whether the Board's action was illegal, arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. The court rejected the trial court's conclusion that the introduction of some reputation evidence and some &quot;unreliable&quot; hearsay affected the licensees' rights. However, the evidence might have resulted in an injustice with respect to the penalty recommended by the Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment as to only two counts. The court otherwise reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case to the Board for the imposition of a penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had to determine whether the trial court erred in not allowing the patient to demonstrate a physician's agency, bias, and prejudice by cross-examining him about his employment relationship with an his insurer, pursuant to Ariz.

The court held that evidence of the defendant physician's bias, interest, and agency would clearly have been admissible under Ariz. R.

Stat. &sect; 12-569, evidence of a financial interest in the operation of a health care insurer could not be received in evidence for any purpose no matter what type of financial interest the witness possesses in the company. Because the court found that &sect; 12-569 could not be reconciled with the supreme court's evidentiary rule 411, the court held that the statute was unconstitutional.

The next day, the claimant filed a written withdrawal of her hearing request. The Commission allowed the claimant to withdraw her request, but dismissed the employer's request for a hearing as untimely. The affect was to finalize the Commission's original determination. On review, the court held that although the employer had a right to request a hearing under Ariz. Rev.

The claimant's timely request of a hearing did not protect the employer from the operation of the 90-day period.

The lower court granted summary judgment to the supplier. The contractor and surety sought review, claiming that amendments to Ariz. Rev.

On review, the court considered whether the supplier acquired a vested right in the bond because it delivered materials to the contractor prior to the effective date of the amendments, even though the materials were not used until after the effective date. The court concluded that the legislature did not require the materials to be used before the cause of action would arise because it provided for the limitations period to run from the time of delivery of goods. However, the court also concluded that failure to use the materials in residential construction as required by the amended statute was a condition subsequent that defeated the supplier's right of recovery.

Stat. &sect; 12-542, were applicable to the claim, and that the survivors were entitled to the benefit of the longer of the two periods. The court held that the three-year period in &sect; 12-564(A) began to run from the date of &quot;injury&quot; to the decedent around the time of the surgery, and rejected the contention that the &quot;injury&quot; was that suffered by the survivors upon his death. The court noted that &sect; 12-542 began to run on the date of death, and held that the suit was time barred by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were the parents of three minor children. At trial, the jury heard evidence that the children lived in unsanitary conditions, including a leaking portable toilet; that they slept in close proximity to animals which appeared to be diseased and scrap metal automobile parts, tin cans and other discarded items; and that the children, who were kept barefoot, were not protected from scrap lumber with protruding nails and were exposed to the animal feces. In addition, there was evidence that defendants were given one week in which to make changes that were indicated by a caseworker, but failed or refused to do so. The jury convicted defendants of negligent child abuse. Defendants argued that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3623(C) was unconstitutionally void for vagueness and was overbroad because the conduct of endangerment was not defined. The court held that term &quot;endangered&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague and neither was it overbroad. The State had a rational basis for prohibiting defendants from allowing their children to live in conditions that endangered their health. Defendants had fair notice of their legal duty as parents and of the conduct that was statutorily proscribed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a sentencing scheme providing a greater maximum sentence for attempted murder than for murder violated the third prong of the proportionality test, which compared the sentence imposed to the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of criminal damage for damaging a family member's car while on probation. He admitted two prior felony convictions and was sentenced to 3.75 years' imprisonment. Probation was revoked and defendant was sentenced to a presumptive term of five years in prison. The court held that imposition of the sentence was not cruel and unusual. Under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-701(B)(5) and 13-604.02(B), 3.75 years was the minimum sentence possible for the criminal damage crime committed while defendant was on probation. Section 13-604.02(B) also required the sentence to be consecutive to the sentence imposed on the probation revocation. The court held that the factors used to determine whether a sentence was unconstitutionally excessive supported defendant's sentence. The offense involved violence and was sufficiently grave to warrant enhanced punishment. The sentence was not too harsh, as defendant was a repeat offender. The sentence was proportional to sentences imposed for similar crimes in the jurisdiction. Finally, the classification of the offense by the dollar amount of damages did not result in disproportionality with other jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>

Two weeks before the accident, the Arizona legislature enacted Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 20-259.01 giving insureds the option of increasing their uninsured motorist coverage to the policy limits. After the accident, the husband sent the insurer a check requesting that the uninsured motorist coverage on his policy be increased retroactively to the policy limits. The insurer applied the check to the policy renewal period and the estate brought suit against the insurer. The trial court found for the insurer and the court affirmed. The court noted that the cardinal rule of statutory construction was to ascertain the statute's meaning and the legislature's intent. Reading the statute as a whole, the court concluded that the insurer was under no obligation to notify its insureds that they had the option to increase uninsured motorist coverage.

The administrative law judge (ALJ) found that the Commission had no jurisdiction to consider the claim, which had been filed more than one year after the injury occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee claimed that he injured his back when he fell off a ladder in the course of his employment. More than a year later, he filed a claim for compensation for back surgery, which he alleged was causally related to the industrial incident. The carrier raised the issue of untimely filing, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1061(D). A hearing limited to the issue of jurisdiction was held and the ALJ found that the employee did not fall within any of the statutory exceptions to the one-year filing limitation. On appeal, the employee argued that the 1980 statutory amendments to &sect; 23-1061(A) violated Ariz. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 8 as interpreted by the Arizona Supreme Court. The court affirmed. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1061(A) expressly provided that, subject to the exceptions set forth in the statute, neither the Commission nor any court would have jurisdiction to consider a claim that was not timely filed.

In dividing the property, the trial court determined that a trust, some securities, and the husband's salary earned while the parties were separated were community property and awarded the wife one-half. The trial court also granted the wife a money settlement and spousal support. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the marriage, the husband became the beneficiary of a one-fifth interest in a trust. He commingled the income from the trust with marital funds and purchased an additional two-fifths interest in the trust and oil company stock. Husband and wife separated. He lived in their marital residence in California and she lived in their retirement home in Arizona. On appeal, the court found that the one-fifth share in the trust was separate property, but that the two-fifths shares in the trust and the oil company stock were purchased with commingled funds and were community property. As an issue of first impression, the court determined that Arizona community property law governed a dissolution action filed in Arizona, even where one spouse was the resident of another state. The husband's earnings while the parties were separated were community property. The trial court erred in granting the wife monetary settlements. The trial court exceeded its authority in considering assets no longer in existence at the time of dissolution. The trial court did not err in granting the wife spousal support.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's mental health expert's testimony was not confusing and did not prejudice defendant. The grand jury proceeding was proper because indictments could be based on hearsay. Furthermore, challenges to grand jury testimony were not reviewable on appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city brought an eminent domain action to take the condemnees' land. At trial, the condemnees produced expert testimony on the rate of return a prudent investor would have achieved with the condemnees' resources, to support their application for compound interest in excess of the rate in &sect; 44-1201(A). The jury awarded the fair market value of the property to the condemnees, but the superior court denied the excess interest and refused the compounding of interest. The condemnees appealed. The court affirmed. The court found that the income bracket of the condemnees was irrelevant, because there was a goal of uniformity in treatment of condemnees and the financial status of the condemnee was an inappropriate test for the constitutionality of &sect; 44-1201(A). The court found that the prudent person investor standard was limited to the restriction of obligations comparable to the condemnor even when that was not the highest yield. The statutory interest rate of &sect; 44-1201(A) was presumed reasonable and compounding of interest was not an element of the constitutional right to just compensation. The superior court had not erred in denying compound interest in excess of &sect; 44-1201(A).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the injured party was hired, state law provided that he would receive an accidental disability pension if an injury incurred in the performance of his job prevented him from performing his regularly assigned duties. Nine years later, the law was amended to provide for a disability pension only if an employee was unable to perform a reasonable range of duties within his department. Several months later, the injured party was injured while on duty. The board awarded the injured party accidental disability benefits, applying the definition of accidental disability in effect when the injured party was hired. The fund manager petitioned the board for rehearing, asserting that the injured party's eligibility should have been determined pursuant to the 1980 amendment to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-842(1). The board upheld its decision, and the fund manager appealed to the trial court. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the injured party. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the right to an accidental disability pension did not vest until the contingent event of injury occurred; therefore, the amended version of &sect; 38-842(1) applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ward had been mentally retarded since birth and was adjudged an incapacitated person and placed under the guardianship of his mother. The trial court held that the group home was not a licensed health care provider; that the two-year statute of limitations for ordinary negligence, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-542, was applicable; and that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-502 did not toll the period of limitations because the ward had a guardian. The court found that appointment of a guardian for an insane person did not constitute removal of the insane person's disability for purposes of the tolling statute,&nbsp;&sect; 12-502; thus, as to the ward, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-542 was not a bar to the litigation. However, the court concluded that the guardian's individual claims were not tolled. The court found that the group home was not a &quot;licensed health care provider,&quot; because it did not have a license from the Arizona Department of Health Services. Thus, the court concluded that the group home was not subject to suit for medical malpractice, and the guardian's individual claims against the group home and the State were barred by &sect; 12-542.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff student filed a suit against defendant interscholastic association requesting that defendant be enjoined from disqualifying plaintiff from interscholastic athletic competition and that defendant's actions be declared unconstitutional as a denial of due process.

The court affirmed the lower court's order in part and reversed in part. The court held that defendant did act arbitrarily in exercising its discretion in denying plaintiff's waiver because although defendant's bylaws allowed for a waiver of disqualification upon the showing of hardship, defendant also had a policy of not making any exceptions to an age eligibility requirement under which plaintiff took exception. However, the court held that friendship, discipline, and regulation involved in playing varsity sports were all insufficient to assert a cognizable interest under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for constitutional protection.</SPAN></P>

The MVD later reinstated her license after receiving evidence that defendant was psychologically unable to comprehend the implied consent law warning given to her by police.

Finding no merit to the defendants' contentions, the court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The court held that defendants they had no standing to raise constitutional issues predicated on the argument the RICO act made the charges a criminal proceeding. The court found that defendants were not entitled to the criminal due process protections because the trial was civil, not criminal. The court noted that the statute specifically created the civil claim which was brought against the defendants. The court also found that defendants raised no objection to any of the jury instructions and failed to ask for an instruction on the crime of scheme or artifice to defraud.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee acquired oil and gas leases from the Department. Because such leases were non-renewable, the Department acquiesced in a &quot;surrender and refile&quot; procedure whereby a lessee could surrender its lease before its expiration date and refile for a new lease. Before the effective date of legislation raising the rental rates for such leases, the lessee surrendered its leases and filed new applications. The Department refused to issue new leases except at the higher rental rate. When the lessee refused to agree to the new rate, the Department issued leases to the subsequent lessee. The lessee filed suit, and the trial court found in its favor. On appeal, the court rejected the Department's contention that the lessee failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. However, the court held that the &quot;surrender and refile&quot; procedure was invalid because it contravened the statutory goal of requiring lessees to actively seek and produce oil and gas on State lands. The fact that the Department had operated under the &quot;surrender and refile&quot; procedure for over 24 years did not affect the court's decision. The lessee was not entitled to attorney's fees under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-341.01(A).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment by the Superior Court of Yavapai County (Arizona) in which he was convicted of one count of trafficking in stolen property, a violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2307(A), and one count of theft, a violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1802(A)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether the jury was improperly instructed as to the inference to be drawn from possession of recently stolen property. At the close of evidence, the trial judge instructed the jury that that proof that defendant was in possession of property recently stolen, unless satisfactorily explained, gave rise to an inference that defendant in possession of the property was aware of the risk that it had been stolen or in some way participated in its theft. Defendant raised a variety of objections to the instruction. The instruction was substantially identical to the statutory inference created by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2305(1). The court held that the instruction created an unconstitutional burden-shifting presumption. The jury was instructed that proof that defendant possessed recently stolen property, &quot;gave rise to the inference&quot; that he was aware of the risk that it had been stolen, unless he satisfactorily explained his possession of the property. The instruction unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to defendant on an element of each offense--trafficking and theft--in violation of the principles enunciated in previous case law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an applicant for a retailer's liquor license (retailer) and the Arizona State Liquor Board, challenged an order of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) which, relying on Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4-207, overturned the Board's administrative decision approving the retailer's application despite the opposition of appellee, a neighboring church. Because the license had been issued, the order was stayed pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the Board approved the license application despite the church's opposition, the church appealed. The superior court then reversed the Board's ruling, finding no substantial evidence to support it and ruling that the Board acted arbitrarily and capriciously and abused its discretion. On appeal, the court found both that the Board had acted illegally and that &sect; 4-207(A)(1) was unconstitutional. On the first point, the court held that because the proposed establishment was within 300 feet of the church, the Board could not have lawfully considered measurements from other beginning and ending points, its ruling improperly disregarded the evidence, and its decision completely disregarded legislative requirements. On the second point, the court held that subsection (A)(1) was unconstitutional because it gave veto power over the issuance of the liquor license to the church in violation of the Establishment Clause. However, because subsection (A)(1) was properly severed from the balance of the statute, the court held that a new hearing was necessary in order to determine whether the city council, absent the influence of the church's veto, wished to approve the license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that to the extent it allowed the church to exercise a veto over the license, the statute was unconstitutional. It ordered that the matter be submitted to local government authorities once again for a new hearing. If the local government authorities recommended approval, the existing license was to be validated. Otherwise, it was to be rescinded.</SPAN></P>

The jury found him guilty of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor with two prior convictions within a period of 60 months, and on appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court determined that the trial court had the power to retroactively apply a procedural rule that dealt with the foundation for admitting defendant's breath tests into evidence. Jurors did not receive information from an outside source when a juror narrated his personal experiences with drunk driving incidents. Any error in admitting a horizontal nystagmus test was harmless considering the amount of admissible evidence that showed that defendant was intoxicated. The police did not unreasonably interfere with defendant's ability to make phone calls to find a physician to administer an independent blood alcohol test because defendant was allowed to make several phone calls before he was transferred to another facility. Although the trial court erred in not accepting defendant's stipulation that he had two prior convictions, it was harmless error in light of the overwhelming evidence against him.</SPAN></P>

The litigants counterclaimed, seeking damages for breach of contract and for trespass. The litigants filed a third party claim against the county. In a jury trial, the Superior Court of Navajo County (Arizona) awarded monetary damages to each party that cancelled one another out. The litigants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The phone company installed underground cable across the property in 1978. The phone company argued they had authority to enter and lay the cable by way of an easement from 1957. In mid-1980, the phone company obtained a permit from the county to work on a public right of way to lay a second underground cable 33 feet off the center line of the road across the litigant's property. The litigants blocked the laying of cable. The trial court awarded partial summary judgment, holding the road was a public highway and the county had authority to grant franchises for utility use. The county was dismissed from the suit. The trial court ruled the easement was no longer in effect and the county could grant a right of way 33 feet on either side of the center line of a county highway. The court held that (1) where the county was no longer a party to the suit, the litigant's claim that their property was taken without just compensation was not properly before the court, (2) the litigant's failed to produce evidence of prejudice or an unjust result, and (3) a proper foundation was laid for the admission of the document the phone company relied on as authority for laying of the first cable.</SPAN></P>

The psychiatric patient contended that the definition of &quot;danger to others&quot; in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-501(3) was insufficient as a basis for commitment. The psychiatric patient argued that no finding of danger to others was constitutional unless predicated on recent dangerous conduct. Affirming, the court held that the standard in the definition was constitutional. The court found that the requirement of &quot;competent medical opinion&quot; in &sect; 36-501(3) was not an unlawful delegation of legislative power and did not serve to deprive her of a neutral fact finder on the issue of dangerousness. The court doubted the applicability of the notion of &quot;fair warning&quot; to a class composed of those mentally incompetent to make judgments. The court found an implicit requirement of imminence of danger in &sect; 36-501(3). The court held that Miranda warnings were not required before the psychiatric patient gave responses to a physician in the commitment process.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the health clinic had standing and that the use of search warrants for the seizure of medical records of the health clinic's patients was not unconstitutional. The court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of the city and the department and held that the health clinic was not required to assert the physician-patient privilege under Ariz. Rev.

The court reasoned that the statutory scheme provided no scheme under which the health clinic was required to assert such privilege.

Code &sect; 7-304(B)(1). Defendant was sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence of 10 days in jail. The issue was whether Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3214(B), which allowed municipalities to regulate prostitution, was unconstitutional as either a local or special law or a denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that while another case held that a similar ordinance was not a special law, it did not reach the question of whether the enabling legislation,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3214(B), was special or local legislation. The court rejected defendant's contention that the legislature had indirectly accomplished through the enabling statute what it could not directly accomplish. The court did not see how &sect; 13-3214(B) bestowed favors on any locality or preferred class. The court held that the statute operated uniformly and without favoritism across its jurisdiction, neither mandating that a city or town impose restrictions on prostitution greater than those otherwise applied under Arizona law, nor preventing an unincorporated area from attaining city status and acting on the statute. The court opined that the Arizona legislature properly delegated authority to punish prostitution so that each locality could tailor ordinances to fit individual needs. The court concluded that the legislature could rationally decide that various cities had different problems that required solutions tailored to fit local conditions and that the problem was more prevalent in urban than in rural areas.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the district court's decision to grant summary judgment to the department. The court determined that the tax was directly and specifically on the store for the privilege of conducting business within the state of Arizona. Arizona's transaction privilege tax met the requirements of not interfering with United States foreign policy or creating conflicts and trade barriers between the states, and therefore it was constitutionally permissible. The court found that the tax was purely a domestic, intrastate exaction properly imposed on the store in return for the store's fair share of the benefits and protection afforded to its business by the state of Arizona. The court concluded that the district court did not abuse his discretion by reversing its position on the store's tax liability after there was a fundamental change in law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that the tort of bad faith was an independent cause of action and that damages for pain and mental distress were not compensable under the Workers' Compensation Act (Act). The insurer argued that under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1022(A) (Supp. 1985), recovery under the Act was the employee's exclusive remedy. The court held that the Act's exclusive remedy provision did not apply because bad faith by a carrier in the handling of a workers' compensation claim did not arise out of and in the course of employment. The court found determinative the finding by the Industrial Commission's hearing officer that the insurance carrier had not acted in good faith. The court found that the Act did not address the injuries claimed by the employee. The court also held that the trial court had jurisdiction over the employee's claim because the employee's right to bring the tort action was guaranteed by Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 6. The court reasoned that the employee's injury from the insurer's bad faith was separate and distinct from the original industrial injury and was not compensable under the Act.

The court found that the limitation on the medical liability review panel's jurisdiction and legal authority and the absence of such limitation on the trial court strongly suggested that no superior court jurisdiction or legal authority divestiture was intended by the legislature. The court concluded that expert letters submitted failed to meet the requirements of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-563, that both letters confirmed plaintiff's diagnosis, and that neither letter described a failure to use the proper degree of care.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the buyer became delinquent in taxes for an inn and defaulted on his obligations to sellers, the sellers obtained a judgment against the buyer and repurchased their inn.

The trial court ordered a lifting of the board's stay on transfer and of the suspension of the license. On appeal, the court held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4-210(A)(5) did not limit the board's sanctioning power to the licensed business, which incurred delinquent taxes. The Department of Revenue's foreclosed junior tax liens did not preclude sanctions against a liquor license. The delinquent taxes were a legitimate basis for sanctions.

Defendant was placed on probation. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that although defendant was charged as a principal, the trial court did not err in giving an instruction on accomplice liability because there was no distinction between accomplice and principal liability. Defendant's conviction for &quot;transportation&quot; did not require proof of a change in locality. The statute that criminalized transportation of marijuana separately from, and more severely than, the mere possession of the drug was upheld under the rational basis test. Convictions for possession and transportation of marijuana were permissible under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-116 because the sentences were concurrent. The trial court had the right under Ariz. Rev.

The court held that a person of average intelligence could understand the meaning of the word &quot;transport&quot; within the statute and that the fact that the statute did not indicate the means of transportation, the distance required to be traveled, or the quantity of marijuana needed for conviction did not render the statute unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.

His appeal was dismissed because he failed to pay for transcripts or attempt to secure a stipulation with the prosecutor that the tapes of the city court proceedings be sent untranscribed to the superior court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the city court entered its judgment, defendant filed a notice of appeal to the superior court.

The superior court ordered that defendant either pay for the transcripts or stipulate with the State that the tapes of the city court proceedings be sent untranscribed to the superior court. After defendant failed pay for the transcripts or enter into a stipulation, the State filed a motion to dismiss the appeal. Defendant failed to appear at oral argument on his motion to be found indigent, and the superior court dismissed his appeal. The only issue preserved for appeal was the superior court's dismissal of his appeal from the city court. The court dismissed defendant's appeal, holding that its jurisdiction was limited by Ariz.

The claimant requested the award be set aside on the basis that it was error to find that his condition was stationary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant's physician believed nothing more could be done for claimant's knee, but he recommended treatment transfer to a consulting surgeon, who recommended another operation. The carrier denied the claimant's request to change physicians. The administrative law judge (ALJ) granted the change of physician. The carrier appealed. The court set aside the award. Although Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1071(B) was written in negative terms, the legislative intent was to allow the claimant to change physicians with the consent of his attending physician. Section 23-1071(B) applied because the employer had not elected to provide medical benefits under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1070, which would have triggered Ariz. Comp. R. &amp; Regs. R4-13-113(C). It was undisputed that the claimant had a 10 percent impairment, but the ALJ failed to find if the disability had been truly measured. Although the ALJ stated the total disability was based on the claimant's testimony, the record contained no testimony that he was incapable of obtaining employment. The evidence was insufficient to enable an informed comparative evaluation. The conclusion that claimant's condition was stationary was legally sound.</SPAN></P>

In the criminal action against defendant, the trial court entered an order suppressing the evidence of the components, and the state appealed. The court affirmed the order of suppression, finding that the recording of the serial numbers was unrelated to the exigency justifying entry and involved an additional search not necessitated by the exigency. It was plainly unlawful, and the subsequent warrant did not validate the earlier illegal search.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers had not paid a personal property taxes. The assessor issued a tax bill to the sheriff pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-611. The sheriff notified the taxpayers property would be seized and sold if the taxes were not paid. The taxpayers' action for injunctive relief was dismissed and the sheriff entered the taxpayers' business and seized personal property. The taxpayers then filed an action for damages that challenged the constitutionality of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-204 et seq. and the seizure procedure. The trial court dismissed that action. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the constitutional challenge to &sect; 42-204 because it had been sustained numerous times. However, the court reversed as to the taxpayers' damage complaint, which was based on the use of a tax bill rather than a judicial warrant to obtain entry to the taxpayers business, where the seizure of their property occurred. Because the taxpayers had stated a valid damage complaint, the action was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, stepfather and mother, sought review of their convictions for intentional or knowing child abuse under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3623(B)(1) from the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona). The stepfather argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, and argued that his sentence was excessive in light of those historically imposed for such crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the stepfather was not denied effective assistance of counsel due to his attorney's failure to investigate and present a defense in the face of a psychiatrist's determination that the stepfather did not have a mental disorder and was able to assist in his defense. Based on the child's statements, the child's physical condition, the stepfather's admission that he struck the child, the court also concluded that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the stepfather's conviction of intentional or knowing child abuse. Further, the evidence directly from the victim was inconsistent with a less culpable mental state. Finally, the court held that the sentence imposed was not excessive. The stepfather's higher culpability, enormous physical abuse over a period of years to the child, and the stepfather's age and higher level of mental functioning distinguished the examples relied upon by the stepfather. In addition, the defendants who received lesser sentences displayed a cooperative attitude of an admission of guilt.</SPAN></P>

Appellee Respondent Department of Economic Security had filed an action against the mother seeking to find the child to be dependent and to terminate the mother's parent-child relationship with the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after the mother, who had a history of mental illness, gave birth to the child, the department initiated a dependency proceeding, and the child was adjudicated dependent and placed in its custody. Then, it sought to terminate her relationship with the child. The trial court granted the petition, finding that she could not discharge her parental responsibilities. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the mother had no standing to raise the issue of the termination of the natural father's parent-child relationship with the child because she was not an &quot;aggrieved party&quot; under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-236(A), as such judgment did not operate to deny her any rights; (2) the term &quot;parental responsibilities&quot; did not intend to encompass any exclusive set of factors but intended to establish a standard that permitted flexibility in considering the unique circumstances of each termination case; (3) the statements of a caseworker concerning events which occurred immediately after the child's birth were not hearsay because they were offered to show the basis for the initiation of the investigation; and (4) grounds for termination had to be based upon clear and convincing evidence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal to the superior court, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges on the basis that &sect; 44-1503(A) violated his First Amendment free speech rights. The superior court found, inter alia, that the statute was unconstitutional on its face. The court reversed and remanded, noting that the speech at issue involved commercial speech. Also, the court found that defendant had the burden of proof on the issue of whether the statute was more extensive than reasonably than necessary to further substantial interests. Because defendant had the burden of proof, the court would not presume the unconstitutionality of the statute. Rather, the presumption was that the statute was constitutional until proven otherwise. The court held that &sect; 44-1503 was facially constitutional and that defendant did not meet his burden of proof as to &quot;unreasonableness.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of manslaughter, endangerment, and driving while intoxicated. The trial court imposed presumptive concurrent sentences on the convictions of manslaughter and endangerment. On appeal, the court affirmed. First, the court held that the trial court erred in denying defendant the right to cross-examine the victim's widow concerning the wrongful death action. Even though a default judgment may have been entered in the civil action, it was for the jury to determine whether the witness had a motive to testify to facts consistent with the position she had taken in the wrongful death case. However, in light of the evidence, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further held that defendant's wife was a victim of one of the endangerment counts because she was a passenger in defendant's car; thus, the state was permitted to call her as a witness despite the anti-marital fact privilege, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4062(1) (1984). Finally, the court held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692(M) (1984) was not unconstitutional.

The court rejected defendant's contention that the &quot;peeping tom&quot; statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1504(A)(2), was unconstitutionally vague. Applying the statutory definition of recklessness to the &quot;peeping tom&quot; statute, the court concluded that the State had to first establish that, under all the circumstances and evidence, the risk that there would be an infringement on the inhabitant's right of privacy was so great that disregard of it constituted a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation. This facet of recklessness was objectively based. The State had to further prove defendant's actual awareness of the risk that there would be an infringement of the inhabitant's right of privacy. This second facet of recklessness required defendant's subjective knowledge of the risk before conviction could be had. Because the twofold standard of recklessness was sufficiently precise to be understood and applied by persons of ordinary intelligence, &sect; 13-1504(A)(2) was not impermissibly vague.

The newspaper corrected the story. The defamed persons filed a defamation action. A judgment was entered for the newspaper and the reporter. The defamed persons appealed. The court reversed and held that testimony on the reporter's procedures was admissible as habit evidence under Ariz. R. Evid. 406 and that the absence of expert testimony was not fatal. Based on the uncontradicted evidence, reasonable minds could only conclude that the reporter and the newspapers were negligent. The trial court erred in the way it submitted the issue of liability to the jury. The defamed persons were not allowed to recover damages for emotional distress because under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-653.03 that was not an element of damages for defamation. However, the corrections statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-653.01 et seq., violated the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions by eliminating such recovery. The corrections statute also violated Ariz. Const. art 18, &sect; 6, so the court struck it and decided the claims solely on the state constitutional ground.</SPAN></P>

The applicants filed the action in the trial court alleging that the city council's actions were arbitrary and capricious and that the city ordinances were unconstitutional. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city and the city council. The appellate court affirmed. The court held that the home for the elderly was not a permitted use under the city zoning ordinance and that the city council's denial of a conditional use permit was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. The court found that unrelated elderly people living together did not constitute a &quot;family&quot; within the meaning of the city zoning ordinance. In addition, the city council did not act wrongfully in failing to grant the conditional use permit because the proposed use was not a group home, as defined by the ordinance, but a boarding house.

The employee alleged that &sect; 23-1043.01(B) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the commission's decision holding that because &sect; 23-1043.01(B) treated all persons within a class equally, it did not violate the equal protection clause. The court further held that the higher evidentiary burden that was placed on claims for mental injuries under the statute was reasonable in light of the problems associated with establishing a causal nexus between mental illness and the workplace. Finally, the court held that because the employee's firing, which caused her emotional problems, was not substantially related to her work-related injury, the commission correctly concluded that the employee's emotional problems were not compensable under &sect; 23-1043.01(B).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision. It held that worker's compensation was the employee's and his survivors' exclusive remedy against the employer. It rejected plaintiffs' argument that the &quot;dual capacity&quot; doctrine allowed her to proceed against the employer because it had participated in manufacturing the truck and boom involved in the accident and because it was a supplier of electricity, stating that the doctrine conflicted with Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1022(A), providing for the exclusive remedy, and subverted the legislature's intent in enacting the statute. It held that because plaintiff had not filed a tort action within one year of the accident, her claims against third parties were assigned to the employer, which was self-insured, under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1023. It stated that this rule applied to the claims against the co-workers as well. It rejected plaintiff's argument that the assignment of her claim after one year violated due process and equal protection, stating that the statute did not treat employees of self-insured carriers differently from other employees and that the state supreme court had previously upheld the statute's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the promisees' motion to dismiss. On review, the appellate court reversed. The trial court subsequently granted the promisees' motion for summary judgment. On further review, the court held that the issues before the trial court had not been previously determined when it entered summary judgment for the promisees. There was no iron clad rule that a denial of summary judgment motion was res judicata and absolutely precluded renewal or the making of a subsequent motion for the same relief. There was further discovery undertaken between the time of the first denial of the motion for summary judgment and the second filing of the new motion. Therefore, even though successive motions were filed, the court found no abuse of the system. The court held that the promisor's offer in the amended complaint to pay the amount of judgment did not satisfy the requirement of &quot;tender&quot; to the promisees as a condition precedent to setting aside the sale. There was no denial of due process due to lack of personal notice to the execution on the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The only way the trial court could have been correct in denying the motion for summary judgment was if the health plan had a valid, perfected lien on the policy limits. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-2903(E) made no mention of any assignment of liability coverage. All the administrator was authorized to do was to coordinate benefits payable to an injured eligible person from third parties. The statute did not authorize him to create a lien. Any Access rules or regulations, which purported to give the health plan a lien on liability coverage, was of no effect. Nothing in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-2915 showed that the legislature intended it to apply retroactively. Even if the legislative intent in passing the Access program was to give the administrator broad authority under &sect; 36-2903, the legislature could not have granted the health plan the ability to create statutory liens because that would be an unconstitutional delegation of the power to make law. The health plan was not entitled to any of the impleaded fund, and the trial court acted in excess of its authority in denying the patient's motion for summary judgment. The court vacated the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee filed an action for a declaratory judgment that sought to find appellant, which did not have a high school for its students, liable for the transportation costs of bringing students to appellee's high school. Appellant furnished transportation to a high school in a neighboring district but did not provide transportation to other districts, including appellee's district. The trial court ruled in favor of appellee and denied appellant's motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court reversed. Once appellant decided that transportation of students to any other than the neighboring district was not in appellant's best interest, it was a usurpation of its power for appellee to charge appellant for that transportation. The court found no express statutory language permitting appellee to charge appellant for transporting the students, and there was no implication that such charges were permissible. Absent statutory authority, common sense dictated that when high school students in a district without a high school could attend any high school district in the state, it would be impossible for the sending district to transport large numbers of pupils, each to a different high school.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 4, pt. 2, &sect; 19 finding that it operated uniformly on all persons within the jurisdictional limits of the city, excluded no particular persons or locations, and that it was not a law plainly intended for a particular case. Defendant argued that &sect; 23-52(a) violated the state and federal equal protection clauses in that an individual in the city could have been punished differently than individuals in other areas of the state for the same offense. The court found that defendant identified no fundamental right denied him by the ordinance, nor was he a member of any suspect class. The court held that by enacting Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3214(B) the legislature intended that cities and towns enact ordinances to suppress and prohibit prostitution and provide for punishment at least as stringent as a subsection A, class 1 misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner brought suit against appellees, the State and the Department of Corrections, asserting that the inclusion of only class four, five, and six offenders in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-233(G) was unconstitutional. Cross-motions to dismiss were granted by the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona). The prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue in this case was whether the trial court erred in dismissing the prisoner's constitutional and statutory challenges to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-233(G), a provision that granted early parole eligibility to certain offenders. The prisoner was convicted of theft by false pretenses under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-661, the old criminal code, and subsequently applied for early parole eligibility under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-233(G), which he was denied. The statute allowed parole applications by certain prisoners when there was a shortage of beds within the Department of Corrections. To be eligible, a person must have been sentenced for a class four, five, and six felony. However, the prisoner was sentenced under the old criminal code, which did not contain class four, five, and six felony classifications. He was found ineligible for the early parole, and his application was denied. He appealed. The court held that an old code offender whose crime could reasonably be found equivalent to a class four, five, and six felony was eligible for early parole if other statutory criteria were met. Thus, the prisoner was eligible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of dismissal entered by the trial court was reversed and the case was remanded with directions to order proceedings before the Board of Pardons and Paroles consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found that Ariz. Rev.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-801 et seq., where defendant made no showing that he was the subject of prosecution based on an unjustifiable selection standard. The court held the trafficking statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev.

The court determined defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on entrapment where he did not admit to the elements of the crime charged. The court concluded that defendant's ten-year sentence was not excessive or disproportionate where defendant had been previously convicted of two felonies.

The court held that an objective standard should be set for termination of parental rights and found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-533(B)(3) was not unconstitutionally vague. The doctors testified that the mother's mental condition and her inability to be an effective parent would continue for a prolonged indeterminate period. The mother also argued that the evidence was not clear and convincing that she suffered from a mental illness. However, the evidence clearly showed that the mother was unable to discharge her parental responsibilities and that the mental condition that prevented her from doing so was likely to continue for a prolonged indeterminate period. Under these circumstances, the trial court found that it was in the children's best interest that they be freed for adoption. There was clear and convincing evidence to support the termination of parental rights. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The cement plant's taxes increased substantially because of being in the fire district. The court reversed the decision of the trial court. The trial court had voided the annexation because the persons who signed the petition did not reside on land contiguous to the existing fire district, and because the fire district was a quasi improvement district, which would require the cement plant to receive some special benefits before it could be validly assessed any fire district taxes. The court disagreed with the trial court and found that the annexation petition under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-1006.01(A) had been signed by at least 51 percent of the qualified electors. The court found that the fire district was a quasi-municipal corporation, and was not organized to benefit any particular piece of property.

The court found that the construction and interpretation of disputed contractual terms by the registrar pursuant to Ariz. Rev.

The court found that the decision of the lower court to give preclusive effect to the registrar's decision, which was previously affirmed in the statutory appeal, in the declaratory judgment action was proper.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving while intoxicated on May 28, 1980, and again in July, 1981. On March 2, 1983, he allegedly committed a third DWI offense while his driver's license was revoked and was charged under both &sect; 28-692.01.F. and &sect; 28-692.02.A. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss both charges on the ground that the application of the above statutes to him constituted a prohibited ex post facto law. The trial court agreed and dismissed both counts of the indictment. The state appealed. The court found that the punishment imposed under &sect; 28-692.01.F. was based on the third DWI and the statute did not increase the penalty for the prior convictions. The court found that except for the third conviction, there would have been no punishment beyond that originally imposed for the first two DWI's. The court concluded that &sect; 28-692.01.F. was an enhanced punishment statute and that no greater or additional penalty was imposed upon defendant for his earlier offenses by virtue of &sect; 28-692.01.F. The court held that the statute was not an ex post facto law and reversed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the trial court (Arizona) for conspiracy to commit a fraudulent scheme. Defendant argued that his right to confront witnesses was breached through the admission into evidence of the confession of an accomplice who was deceased at the time of trial, that prejudicial error occurred during jury voir dire, and that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604(b)&nbsp;unconstitutionally discriminated for punishment enhancement purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An accomplice was indicted for passing stolen checks and told the police of his and defendant's part in the scheme but he died in a car accident before trial. Defendant denied participating in the conspiracy. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. Defendant attacked the use of the deceased man's statements, a collateral inculpatory statement that implicated defendant and was collateral to the portion implicating the declarant. The admissibility of the declarations mandated that the declarant not only be unavailable but that the statement was against his penal interest and that proof of corroborating circumstances was present to clearly indicate the statement's truthfulness. The declarant had many possible motives for talking to the police that cast doubt on the truth of the declarations and there was a strong need for cross-examination. When viewed in its totality, there were insufficient indicia of the statement's trustworthiness and it was error to admit. There was a rational basis for the difference between the enhancement of punishment between the more serious and the less serious felony and the statute did not violate defendant's equal protection or due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the matter for a new trial. The court held that the statute did not violate defendant's due process or equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the death of the widow's husband, the commission determined the decedent's average monthly wage. The widow and respondent employer argued that an improper formula was utilized. In setting aside the award, the court held that the wrong formula was used because the record did not support the conclusion that the deceased held the same position during each of his prior periods of employment with his employer. Although Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1041(B) did not prescribe any formula to determine the amount which reasonably represented the monthly earning capacity of a decedent in the employment in which he was working at the time of the accident, the decedent's earning capacity could have been determined from similar employees' actual wages. Further, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1046(C) was held constitutional because its construction would not be extended so as to infringe upon the Constitution of the United States or to restrict the states' inherent powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, homeowners association, brought an action to declare and enforce against defendants, new owners, an implied restriction that limited the use of property to a golf course. The trial court ruled for the homeowners association, finding that the property was restricted to a golf course operation and that an implied covenant restricting the use of the property to a golf course arose from the sale of adjacent lots to the homeowners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property in question was a residential land development that consisted of a golf course and adjacent residential lots. Although no restrictions were placed against the golf course itself, other restrictions included references to golf course restrictions. The court distinguished a case that held that an equitable servitude in favor of one parcel of land and against another must have been created by a written instrument, finding that the dispute on the restrictions was against lot owners, whereas this case involved lot owners against the developer. The court found that both estoppel and part performance applied to the golf course restriction to take it out of the statute of frauds, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-101(6), because the developer had orally represented to the homeowners that the golf course retained by them was subject to restrictions until the year 2025. Thus, the parol evidence rule did not apply. The court found that the implied restrictive covenant was enforceable against the new owners as subsequent purchasers who took their ownership with notice of the restriction. The court found that changed circumstances did not warrant abrogating the restriction.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's ruling and held that the commission lacked the statutory authority to dictate to the parties which particular racing officials they would employ, so long as the employed officials were qualified under the applicable rules and statutes. The court rejected defendant's argument that the employment issue was not ripe for consideration; the court also held that the issue was an exception to the mootness doctrine because the issue was capable of repetition, yet evaded review. The court dismissed plaintiff's cross-appeal as moot and held that further consideration of the validity of the racing preference statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 5-110(A), was not merited because the state supreme court upheld, while this appeal was pending, the validity of &sect; 5-110(A) and the parties' agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant's appeal was pending, the Arizona Supreme Court issued an opinion that a sentence could not be imposed on a convicted defendant in absentia, unless there were extraordinary circumstances. Based on the supreme court opinion, the court vacated defendant's sentence. Defendant also contended that under Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 24 he had a right to a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the county in which the offense was alleged to have been committed. The superior court denied the motion because under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-109(B)(5), which provided that if an offense was committed within one mile of a boundary, trial may be held in any of the counties concerned, allowed the offense to be tried in the county. The constitutional provision was not designed to establish venue, but rather to preserve the right to an unbiased jury. The court found that the constitutional provision and &sect; 13-109(B)(5) had as their basis the preservation of different rights. Thus, defendant did not carry his burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect; 13-109(B)(5) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the retroactive application of the statute operated as an ex post fact law in violation of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 9 and 10 and Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 25. The State admitted that the statute was applied retroactively, but argued that the statute did not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws because it was not penal in nature. The court found that the amendment did operate as an ex post facto law and, therefore, reversed that portion of the trial court's order that imposed a monetary assessment and restitution. The statute was retrospective and disadvantaged the offender. The court affirmed that portion of the order that committed defendant to the Department of Corrections.</SPAN></P>

The city also challenged the summary judgment granted in favor of the bookstore in its action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and the decision to quash an ex parte temporary restraining order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city brought an action against the bookstore, which sought to abate an alleged nuisance and enjoin its maintenance, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-811 et seq. The city obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order and applied for a preliminary injunction. The court affirmed the decision to quash the temporary restraining order, but reversed and remanded the granting of the motion to dismiss and for summary judgment. Section 12-814(B) was not an unconstitutional prior restraint because the purpose of the temporary restraining order was to preserve evidence. However, the temporary restraining order was properly quashed because it did not meet the requirements of Ariz. R. Civ. P. 65(h). The preliminary injunction that was permitted under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-814(E) was not an unconstitutional prior restraint because it provided for adequate procedural safeguards. The court imposed a 60-day maximum limit on the time between the injunction and the final adjudication of the underlying merits of the action. The court held that the provision of &sect; 12-816, which provided for destruction of certain items, was unconstitutional. The rest of the challenged statutes were upheld.</SPAN></P>

Respondent carrier terminated her benefits on the same date. The employee argued that the provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-943.F (Supp. 1983) for making a decision upon review were mandatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee contended that the administrative law judge lacked jurisdiction to issue a decision when the 60-day period for filing a review had expired. The court disagreed and affirmed. The review decision was filed more than 60 days after the date that the employer requested the review. However, the court found that the language of &sect; 23-934.F. (Supp. 1983) was directive but not mandatory. Failure to issue the decision within 60 days did not divest the judge of jurisdiction. Further, the decision was only seven days late. The judge had to ultimately decide whether or not the employee's condition was stationary without permanent impairment. There was conflicting medical evidence and the judge's decision that stated that he considered and resolved all conflicts was specific enough to adequately dispose of the material issues. There was sufficient medical evidence in the record to support the finding that the employee's condition was stationary with no permanent impairment. The judge lacked authority to authorize the benefits for surgery that was performed when the award was still on administrative review.</SPAN></P>

The proprietor cross-appealed the trial court's judgment that the amended Tucson, Ariz., Code &sect; 19-28(149) (amended ordinance) was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proprietor paid the occupational license taxes under protest and brought an action against the city, claiming that the original and amended ordinances were unconstitutional because they were confiscatory. The trial court found that the original ordinance was unconstitutional but that the amended ordinance was valid. On appeal, the court vacated the finding that the original ordinance was unconstitutional. The proprietor had not attempted to collect the tax, and so its arguments as to the tax's effects were speculative. The proprietor's survey of the vendors and testimony by an economist did not suffice to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the original ordinance was confiscatory. The original ordinance was an exercise of the power to raise revenue and not regulatory. The court affirmed the trial court's finding that the amended ordinance was valid. In so doing, the court rejected the proprietor's argument that the state constitution required occupational license taxes to be at the same rate as sales taxes. The city's council's decision to classify swap meet operators differently from retail merchants and peddlers was not arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal attacked as being unconstitutionally vague a City of Phoenix ordinance which prohibited certain types of land use in a heavy industrial district zoned A-2. They raised three issues for the court's consideration: 1. that Phoenix, Ariz., Zoning Code, Ordinance G-449, Appendix A, &sect; 421(A)(1) was void for vagueness or uncertainty, 2. that the ordinance was discriminatorily enforced against the operators, and 3. that the state was estopped from enforcing the ordinance against the operators. On appeal, the court found that the term &quot;offensive vibration&quot; was not ambiguous and was susceptible to a practical definition. Thus, the court could not accept the operators' position that a person of ordinary intelligence would fail to understand what was proscribed by the terms of the zoning ordinance. Further, there was no question in this case that the vibrations emanating from the operators' lot were unpleasant to the neighboring businesses. The court also held that the contention that the vibrations would not have been offensive to persons employed by neighboring iron foundries or slaughterhouses was speculative at best. The court found that the ordinance was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review from the Superior Court of Mohave County (Arizona), which held that appellees, county and related parties, were not obligated, under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-190, to provide health-related services to the residents of the city after the city refused to pay a requested contribution for the health services. The city contended that the county was obligated to provide the services and also violated equal protection laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county provided health services to the city, and the county health department requested a cost contribution from the city in return for continuation of the health services to the residents. The city refused to pay the contribution and filed a complaint seeking an order requiring the county to continue supplying the health services. The county filed a motion for summary judgment, and the trial court granted the motion. The city appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that the county was not required to provide the contested health services to the city and, if it did, it could lawfully charge the city for those services because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-190 did not obligate the county to provide health services to residents of the city at no charge. The court held that it was not a violation of equal protection laws to allow the county to require a cost contribution from the city, where identical services were provided to residents of the county living outside the corporate limits of the city without any additional charge. The taxpayers could not base valid equal protection claims on the fact that they did not receive tax monies to the same extent as other citizens.</SPAN></P>

Through a series of wiretaps, the investigators uncovered the chain of defendants' narcotics operation. On appeal of defendants' convictions, the court affirmed. The trial court did not err by refusing to suppress the wiretaps. Evidence showed that the officers minimized their interceptions of non-pertinent calls as required, and the fact that the tapes of the conversations were sealed late did not require their suppress because defense counsel specifically stated that there was no suggestion that tape's integrity had been affected. The court held that the applications for the wiretaps were sufficient because even though they were labeled as amendments they conformed with the statutory requirements for applications, and they showed that the wiretaps were necessary and that there was probable cause. The Arizona Wiretap Statute, former Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1057, violated neither U.S. Const. amend. IV, U.S. Const. art. VI, nor 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2510 et seq.

Defendant attacked the constitutionality of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692 on numerous grounds and challenged a refusal to dismiss the indictment against him as duplicitous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant collided with another car, and police were called. Defendant backed into a police vehicle at the scene. He failed three field sobriety tests, he was arrested for drunk driving, and the intoxilyzer results showed a blood alcohol reading of .39 percent. A second test, performed an hour later because of the high reading, showed .38 percent. Defendant did not raise the constitutional attacks asserted on appeal in the trial court. The indictment charged defendant with, and the jury convicted him of, either driving under the influence or driving with a blood alcohol reading of .10 percent or more. The court held that the challenged statute gave fair warning of the prohibited conduct and rejected defendant's constitutional attacks grounded on vagueness, overbreadth, and violations of equal protection guarantees. The court found it reasonable to assume that defendant's ability to drive was impaired based on his high level of blood alcohol, but it determined that the jury's verdict was void because it found defendant guilty under an indictment alleging two separate drunk driving crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital admitted for emergency treatment a child and an indigent adult. When the child later became indigent due to the hospital bill, the hospital notified the county pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-297.01. At the time the patient was not medically transferable. The child's parents initially refused to consent to the transfer, but did consent 12 days after the child had been declared transferable. The hospital filed a successful action against the county to recover at the full rate the services provided to the indigent patients, after the county paid the adult's costs only at the Medicare/Medicaid rate and refused to pay the child's bill due to his parent's initial refusal to transfer him. On appeal, the court affirmed the order with respect to the reimbursement allowed for the adult's emergency treatment and reversed and remanded with respect to the costs incurred from the time the child became indigent to the date of his transfer. The court held that the hospital was entitled to full reimbursement for emergency treatment, but where a service was provided under other than emergency conditions, it was entitled to reimbursement only at the Medicare/Medicaid rate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was fatally injured in the course and scope of his employment. The widow and children received workers' compensation death benefits but did not file a personal injury suit within one year from the date of injury. Consequently, the claim was automatically assigned by operation of law to the insurance carrier. The carrier reassigned the claim to the widow and children before the expiration of the personal injury limitations period. While the wrongful death action was pending, the Arizona Supreme Court, in an unrelated case, held that a claim assigned to an insurance carrier by operation of law could not be reassigned. As a result, summary judgment dismissing the action was entered. Thereafter, an amendment to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1023(B), which contained a retroactive provision, authorized the reassignment of an assigned claim. The trial court denied a motion to set aside the summary judgment on that basis. The court, in reversing, held that the retroactive provision did not violate due process because there was no vested right to the defense of nonassignability of tort claims. The retroactive provision of the amended statute did not create a new substantive right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A denturist was charged with unprofessional conduct and his certificate for the practice of denture technology was suspended by the board.

Both the denturist and the board appealed. The court modified the order for a remand to require not only a rehearing but to remand the matter to the complaint investigatory stage. The court ruled that the denturist's procedural due process rights were violated by the board's noncompliance with a statutory duty that, in all matters relating to discipline and certifying of denturists, the board was required to provide, by rule and regulation, for receiving the assistance and advice of denturists who have been previously certified.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed a request for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus to free him from the custody of the department of corrections. The inmate contended that he was promised a commutation of the sentence he was serving for second degree murder in return for his cooperation in connection with cases arising out of a prison escape. The trial court denied his request for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court determined that the inmate did not have an agreement with any person or persons who were authorized by law to effect his release. The court agreed with the trial court's finding that even if the chairman of the board of pardons and paroles made a promise, he had no authority to speak for other members of the board and no enforceable agreement arose thereby. The court held that the trial court did not err in failing sua sponte to appoint counsel to represent the inmate and in refusing to allow advisory counsel to sit with the inmate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with sexual assault with two prior felonies in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1406. Defendant entered an Alford plea on the day before the trial was to have begun. Defendant learned that the prosecutrix, who moved to another state, would have been unavailable to testify. Defendant alleged that prosecutrix's failure to return to Arizona constituted a recantation of her allegations and invalidated his plea. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. Defendant's allegation of a recantation by the prosecutrix was speculative and his plea was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made. The plea was not vulnerable to attack based on the mistake of fact that the prosecutrix was to have been available to testify. The State had no knowledge that the prosecutrix was not going to return to Arizona at the time of the entry of the plea. Given the terms of the plea, the trial court did not have to rule on an allegation of a prior conviction filed by the State outside of the time limits stated in Ariz. R. Crim. P. 16.1. The sentence required modification to provide for a term of imprisonment and not commitment to the Arizona Department of Corrections.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the sentence imposed by the trial court and found that the relevant statutory provisions, construed in pari materia, yielded the result reached by the trial court. Under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692.02(A) (amended 1982), the Arizona Legislature sought to impose more severe penalties on those drivers who operated vehicles under the influence, and for drivers who did so while their licenses were revoked, a six-month term of imprisonment was required. Under &sect; 28-692.02(A), probation or release on any other basis was not allowed except upon the condition of a minimum six-month prison term. Section 28-692.02(A) was a special statute and did not conflict with the general provisions related to the granting of probation under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-901. The court found defendant's claim that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692 (amended 1982) was unconstitutionally vague was without merit.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that it was error for the jury to have before it an exhibit having information regarding punishment.

The court affirmed, holding that admission of the exhibit was not fundamental error. It did not go to the foundation of the case or take from defendant a right essential to his defense. Further, because admission was not fundamental error, defendant waived his right to appeal because he failed to object at trial.

The trial court awarded summary judgment to the hospital and doctors, and the court affirmed. The court held that the rational basis test was applicable in testing the statute's constitutionality under an equal protection analysis because the legally imposed status of minority was not a suspect classification.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were convicted in a justice court of various gaming violations. Appellants sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Yuma County (Arizona), which affirmed their convictions and sentences. Appellants challenged the constitutional validity of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-211, which enabled game wardens to conduct warrantless searches in certain circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal, as framed by appellants, was that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-211 was unconstitutional on its face because it authorized a warrantless search without probable cause. Appellants premised their argument on the fact that &sect; 17-211(D)(3) used the term &quot;sufficient cause&quot; when it referred to the authority of game rangers and wildlife managers to conduct searches without warrants. On appeal, the court disagreed with the arguments of appellants and upheld the constitutionality of the statute. The court reasoned that while &sect; 17-211, appeared to place game rangers and wildlife managers in a separate category apart from other law enforcement officers it could not place them above the state and federal constitutions. The court construed the statute in a manner that subjected game rangers and wildlife managers to exactly the same constitutional constraints that all law enforcement officers were subject to observe. As the court construed the statute it was a codification of some of the common law exceptions to the search warrant requirement as developed in case law precedent.</SPAN></P>

A nurse erroneously wrote in the mother's chart that her blood type was Rh positive rather than Rh negative, resulting in not receiving RhoGAM immediately after delivery. The parents' second child was born dead and the mother required a tubal ligation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' claims in their medical malpractice action were for the wrongful death of the second baby and for personal injuries sustained by the mother, including medical expenses associated with her second pregnancy and the tubal ligation, and damages for the resulting sterility. Both claims were based on the doctor's employee's alleged negligence in incorrectly recording the mother's blood type. The court reversed the trial court's dismissal and asserted that the matter was not barred by the three-year statute of limitations. The court explained that no injury occurred to the mother until she either conceived or gave birth to her second child. The court found that had she not become pregnant a second time, no injury would have resulted. However, the court observed that ultimately the date of injury to the deceased child was the relevant trigger for the statute of limitations, not the date of injury to the mother. The court noted that injury to the deceased child could not have occurred prior to the date the child was conceived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the filing of the adoption petition, the children had been adjudicated to be dependent minor children and had been made wards of the juvenile court in another county, with temporary custody awarded to a grandmother. Consequently, the trial court ordered that the adoption petition be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The court, in affirming, held that under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-202, the juvenile court that had found the children to be dependent children had exclusive jurisdiction over the children until such time as they were released as wards of that court. The later filing of an adoption petition did not divest the juvenile court of its continuing jurisdiction over the two dependent minor children. The court observed that where two courts had concurrent jurisdiction, the first court to acquire such jurisdiction retained it to the exclusion of the other until the case was finally determined. It would not have been in the best interests of the minor children or of an orderly judicial process for the trial court to assume jurisdiction in an adoption proceeding when there was a dependency proceeding that involved the same children in a different juvenile court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juvenile court judge issued orders authorizing compensation for the attorneys in excess of the limit imposed by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-225(A) for representing indigent parties. The county refused to pay the ordered compensation and the attorneys brought suit under a contract theory. The trial court granted the county's motion for summary judgment, and the court affirmed. The court refused to accept the attorneys' contention that &sect; 8-225(A) was unconstitutional. Any remedy in this regard had to be obtained from the legislature and the court noted that, in fact, &sect; 8-225(A) had been revised, subsequent to the proceedings that gave rise to the case, to delete the limit. The court appreciated the juvenile court judge's concern that court appointed counsel had to be adequately compensated for representing parties and children before the juvenile court. In spite of this desire to be equitable, the court concluded that it had to find that the juvenile court judge's orders were void ab initio. He simply did not have the authority to substitute his concept for what the law ought to be for what the statute said the law actually was.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction, following a jury trial in the Superior Court of Navajo County (Arizona), for theft.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The oath required by Ariz. R. Crim. P. 18.6(b) was not administered to the jury until after the trial was complete and shortly before the jury began its deliberations. Defendant contended that this error rendered the jury's verdict a nullity. The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's conviction. The court reviewed the decisions of other jurisdictions and concluded that the apparent majority rule was that a failure to swear the jury until the case had commenced was generally harmless error, at least, where there was no actual prejudice shown and the oath was administered prior to deliberations. The court found that the failure to administer the oath prior to trial was a technical violation of rule 18.6(b) but, because the jurors were sworn prior to their deliberations, and there was no manifest appearance or suggestion that the jurors disregarded their obligations, the court concluded that no reversible error was committed in this case. The court also found that a delay in defendant's initial appearance, 18 days after his incarceration, which was contrary to the requirements of Ariz. R. Crim. P. 4.1, did not entitle defendant to dismissal of the charges against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued with the victim. The victim ran from defendant whereupon defendant shot the victim twice. Defendant left the scene, spent the night with a friend, and then left the state. Defendant claimed that the instruction on general intent unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to defendant, that the flight instruction should not have been given because there was no evidence that defendant left the scene of the crime to evade arrest or that leaving the state was an attempted concealment and that it was error to refuse to give his tendered instruction on self-defense. The court affirmed. The instruction on intent created merely a permissive inference that allowed, but did not require the jury to infer intent from the commission of the act, and placed no burden on defendant. Merely leaving the scene of a crime was not sufficient evidence to support a flight instruction, but the jury was free to disbelieve defendant's explanation and infer that his actions were evidence of concealment. The jury was fully charged on the issue of self-defense. The trial court was not required to single out for special instruction the point made by defendant's requested instruction.</SPAN></P>

The State filed an allegation of prior conviction and dangerous nature for enhancement of punishment. The trial court sentenced defendant to consecutive and concurrent sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction resulted from a series of robberies. The trial court initially found defendant incompetent to stand trial but found him competent several months later. The trial court denied a motion further competency proceedings under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 11.1 after defendant made a suicide attempt. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court's denial of the motion for a competency determination was properly based on a staff psychiatrist report that defendant was competent to stand trial and on defendant's prior psychiatric examinations. The trial judge proceeded over the prior competency proceedings and was in a position to determine whether reasonable grounds for further proceedings were present. The denial of a continuance to allow the defense to secure the attendance of a witness was proper where there was no showing that the witness's testimony would have changed the verdict. Defendant's past conduct justified an order to inconspicuously shackle him to his chair during the trial. The sentence was in compliance with Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-708, 13-702(C). Defendant failed to establish that perjured testimony at trial entitled him to post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

The city filed a cross-appeal challenging the superior court's finding that appellants' production revenues were not taxable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city assessed taxes against appellants pursuant to the city's privilege tax under the Phoenix, Ariz., City Code (code).

Appellants and the city both sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the order in part and reversed it in part. The court held that even though there was a history of administrative interpretation and practice restricting the application of the city's privilege tax to local advertising revenues, &sect; 14-44 of the code clearly permitted taxing on all advertising without a distinction between &quot;local&quot; or &quot;national.&quot; The court reversed the superior court's finding that spot religious announcements were taxable and held that the announcements were not taxable because those people listening to the announcements were not &quot;prospective purchasers&quot; within the meaning of the code. The court affirmed the superior court's ruling that production revenues were not taxable because the transaction of filming commercials did not constitute a sale of tangible personal property as defined by the code.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife moved to Arizona in 1970 after several years of marriage in noncommunity property states. The husband had interests in a former employer's stock and a corporate pension fund. The trial court granted the bulk of the employer stock to the husband as separate property after applying Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-318 (as amended) and concluding that the laws of the state where the stock was acquired should apply where the stock was acquired before 1973. An amendment was made to &sect; 25-318 after judgment was rendered which gave the statute retroactive application, and which, if applicable, would have treated the stock as quasi-community property. The trial court denied the wife's motion that sought to have the amendment applied. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the amendment could be applied on appeal where the judgment was not yet final. The legislature intended that the retroactivity provision of the amendment caused &sect; 25-318 to apply to property acquired before 1973 and thus treat the stock as quasi-community property.

The doctor brought a special action to challenge the respondent court's decision. The court exercised its power and reversed the decision of the trial court. The court determined that the statute was constitutional, violating neither due process or equal protection, because the action of the legislature was entitled to a presumption of constitutionality, the malpractice crisis was a rational reason for the strict limitations, and the court could offer rational reasons for the exceptions to the limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee junior lienholder claimed an interest in monies due on a promissory note. Appellant FDIC owned a judgment that affected substantially the same property. The FDIC recorded its judgment in 1961, a month before the lienholder. In 1966, the lienholder sought foreclosure, thus terminating the FDIC judgment as an expired title encumbrance. The Superior Court of Yavapai County (Arizona) entered judgment for the lienholder. The FDIC appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1612(A), the FDIC filed and recorded an affidavit for renewal of its judgment in 1966. The FDIC filed a second renewal certificate in 1971 and filed a third affidavit in 1976. The lienholder filed its action in 1973. The lienholder contended that the FDIC's judgment had expired and that successive judgment renewals were not permitted. The FDIC filed a motion to dismiss, which the trial court denied. After amendments to &sect; 12-1612, the FDIC renewed its motion for summary judgment in 1976, which the trial court denied. The court held that successive timely judgment renewals had always been authorized by statute in Arizona. Thus, the junior lien never advanced in priority and had always been subordinate to the FDIC's lien. The 1976 amendment to &sect; 12-1612 did not destroy any vested rights of the junior lienholder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were both convicted of various narcotics offenses and of a conspiracy to commit a felony. Other defendants were indicted along with appellants. Appellants contended that the admission of a co-defendant's declarations under the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule denied them their constitutional right to confront the witnesses against them inasmuch as the co-defendant would have been available for cross-examination had the state entered into a plea agreement with her before appellants' trial rather than after the close of evidence. The court determined that there was no &quot;unavailability&quot; requirement contained in Ariz. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) that would require the state to demonstrate that the co-defendant was unavailable to testify. The court also held that: (1) the trial court did not err when it denied one appellant's request for an instruction on the crime of facilitation and his motion for severance; (2) the Arizona wiretap statutes were not unconstitutional; and (3) the law enforcement authorities' application for a wiretap pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3010 was not premature given the factual circumstances. Thus, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A relative removed the mother's three daughters from her home after it was learned that the girls' stepfather had sexually molested them. The children were eventually placed in foster homes. The mother knew about the abuse, but did not protect her children and refused to establish a home apart from the stepfather. The trial court severed the mother's parental rights. The mother appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding that the mother had abandoned her daughters. The court reasoned that the evidence showed that the molestation was likely to recur and that the mother was incapable of preventing it. Further, the stepfather had not undergone therapy and the mother had a history of being unable to defend herself or her children from abuse. The court also found sufficient evidence to support the trial court's implied finding that continuing the children in a dependency status was an inadequate remedy. Further, the court concluded that the stepfather had no legal right to custody or control of the children. Finally, Arizona's termination statutes remained intact despite a recent change in the burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that testimony of one of the victim's mothers that her child suffered from a brain dysfunction manifested by certain behavior and required a prescription drug to control her behavior was properly admitted. The court stated that the mother, as a lay person, could testify to matters that were within her own personal knowledge and that a qualified medical expert's opinion was not required to provide that information. The court noted that statements in the affidavits of defendant's co-workers contained numerous personal observations, which were presumed to be reliable, regarding defendant's treatment of her students. The court found that the affidavits contained sufficient facts to allow an independent judgment of probable cause sufficient to support the issuance of a search warrant. The court held that the term &quot;endangered&quot; as used within Ariz. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the Superior Court of Gila County (Arizona) of kidnapping under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1304, aggravated assault, and sexual assault, all with the same victim and all on the same date. Defendant was sentenced to two 20-year and one 3-year concurrent terms of imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that that the kidnapping statutes were unconstitutional; that the trial court erred in permitting the State to call an undisclosed expert witness; that the trial court should have given his requested instructions; and that error occurred in the trial court's finding on the allegation of his prior felony conviction. On appeal, the court found that defendant moved and confined the victim in his automobile with the intent to inflict a sexual offense. The victim was 15 years old and her parents had not acquiesced. A person of average intelligence should have been able to realize and have sufficient warning that such conduct was a violation of the kidnapping statutes. The prosecutor notified defense counsel of the new witness the day before trial, which still allowed four days during trial for possible interviews and other preparation. Thus, there was no error in the trial court's refusal to preclude the witness. The law contained in defendant's requested instructions was no longer viable. Lastly, in the trial court's signed minute entry judgment and sentence the court found that defendant's prior offenses were repetitive and referred to the prior felony conviction.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-259(B). The judgment complained of was rendered in the action filed by appellee voters who opposed the districts' proposal to increase the interest rate of certain of the districts' bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The districts proposed to increase their bonds' interest rate to make them more attractive to investors. The districts held an election in which approximately 53 per cent of those voting approved the increase. Although Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-259(B) provided that bonds could be authorized only upon a two-thirds majority, the districts certified the results of the election to the Board of Supervisors as if they had received the requisite approval. Appellees filed an action challenging the results of the election, and the districts argued that the two-thirds requirement was invalid because it applied only to special road districts. The trial court granted appellees summary judgment and the districts appealed. The court affirmed. The districts argued that where legislation singled out one group for disparate treatment, proponents of the legislation were required to show a compelling state interest to justify it. The court held that so long as a super-majority vote requirement did not discriminate or authorize discrimination against any identifiable class, it did not violate the Constitution. The court stated that proponents of a bond issue were not such an identifiable class.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A final judgment of divorce filed in California dissolved the marriage of appellee mother and appellant father. After a California court found the father in arrears in his child support payments, the mother filed suit in the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) to establish the California decree as a judgment and to garnish the father's Arizona bank account. The father challenged the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under a California divorce decree, the father was to pay child support. The father, living overseas, opened a bank account in Arizona. The mother filed a complaint in Arizona to establish the California decree in Arizona as a judgment and sought garnishment of the Arizona bank account to collect unpaid child support. Affirming the grant of summary judgment to the mother, the court held that, as to accrued child support, the California decree ordering support was final and entitled to full faith and credit in the Arizona courts. No motion to revoke or modify the support had been filed in California, and Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4700(a) (Supp. 1982) showed that past due child support was not subject to modification. Further, there was no unfairness in allowing the mother to realize on that debt in Arizona where the father had property, whether or not the Arizona court would have jurisdiction to determine the existence of the debt originally. The court found no error in the garnishment procedures employed or in the trial court's denial of the father's motion to quash because he was given personal notice of the garnishment and had an opportunity to present his defenses to the writ's issuance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord and the housing authority brought a detainer action against the tenant, who lived in public housing. A judgment was secured against the tenant and a writ of restitution was issued. Over objection, the tenant was ordered to pay a bond in order to appeal the adverse judgment. The tenant commenced a special action in the superior court, which found that the bond requirement of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1179 was constitutional. On review, the court found that the superior court committed no error. The bond requirement applied to the action because it was a special rule for forcibly entry and detainer proceedings. Thus, the tenant was not permitted to file an affidavit in lieu of bond. Moreover, &sect; 12-1179 deny unconstitutionally deny the tenant's right to equal protection of the laws. The law had a rational basis in that it served to provide adequate security before an appeal to preserve the property at issue and to guard against damage. Furthermore, the amount of the bond was barely adequate to protect the landlord's interest. Accordingly, &sect; 12-1179 did not unconstitutionally discriminate against the poor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to the charge of unlawful use of means of transportation. The trial court suspended his sentence and placed him on probation under certain terms and conditions. He appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in the order of restitution and in ordering him to reimburse the county for probation services pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-901(A). Defendant also argued that he should not have been ordered to pay restitution in the sum of $ 996.94 when the value of the vehicle he wrecked was $ 795.00 and that the trial court should have conducted a hearing pursuant to &sect; 13-901(H). The court found that, counting the loss suffered by the victim in renting a substitute vehicle, the amount of restitution ordered was proper. The court also found that it was unnecessary for the trial court to conduct a hearing. Defendant contended that &sect; 13-901(A) was unconstitutional because it mandated the payment of a fee as a condition of probation. The court disagreed, noting that there was nothing unconstitutional in the Arizona Legislature enacting legislation that required a financially capable probationer to help defray the State's costs of maintaining him while on probation.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 13-1104(A)(3), were unconstitutionally vague thus in violation of due process and equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's conviction for second-degree murder and unlawful imprisonment, appellant sought review of the judgment.

The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the instructions the jury actually received were adequate. Further, the court held that appellant failed to comply with the disclosure requirements of the Ariz. R. Crim. P. 15.2. The court found that the evidence was cumulative because the doctor who examined the victim in the mental health hearing was allowed to testify that in his opinion the victim was at the time of the examination a danger to himself and others, that he so testified at the hearing and that the victim was not discharged from the hospital until about three weeks after the hearing. Additionally, the court held that because appellant was acquitted of both first degree murder and robbery, he suffered no prejudice from the prosecutor's questions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the father had statutorily abandoned the children and terminated the parent-child relationships.

Stat. &sect; 8-537(B) to support findings with respect to termination of parental rights had been declared unconstitutional since the judgment was entered. The court did not remand because under any constitutionally permissible standard, the evidence was insufficient to show that the father consciously disregarded his parental obligations. While the father was behind on support payments and there was evidence that the father did not contact the children for nearly 14 months, the mother's frequent moves without leaving a forwarding address made it virtually impossible for the father to maintain regular contact.

The court reasoned that keeping the public rights-of-way free from obstruction and protecting the persons and property of a city's citizens were clearly legitimate aims of government. The court also determined that the fact that transients, because they might not have anywhere else to live, sleep or sit except on the public right-of-ways, were subjected to enforcement of &sect; 23-48.01 with greater frequency than residents of the community did not result in unconstitutional discrimination.</SPAN></P>

The contractor had paid state and county taxes for the past two years immediately prior to submitting its bid on plant and equipment required for the performance of the project, but the bidder had not paid such taxes. The trial court ruled that the contractor was entitled to the preference against the bidder thereby making it the lowest bidder. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that the clear import of the language in &sect; 34-241 was that in order to qualify for the statutory preference, a contractor had to have satisfactorily performed prior public contracts and paid state and county taxes of the kind and type specified for at least two years prior to submitting the bid. The court ruled that the classification established in &sect; 34-241 was reasonable and furthered a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which convicted defendant of conspiracy and of promoting, offering, or granting participation in a pyramid scheme, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-1731. In seeking review, defendant challenged &sect; 44-1731's constitutionality and its lawfulness as a strict liability statute and claimed the trial court had erred in admitting coconspirators' statements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After helping with a pyramid scheme, defendant was charged with conspiracy and with participation in a pyramid scheme, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-1731. During the trial, coconspirators' statements were admitted into evidence, and thereafter, defendant was convicted. Accordingly, review was sought, and the court affirmed. In rejecting the contention that &sect; 44-1731 was unconstitutional, the court held &sect; 44-1731 was not vague in failing to distinguish between promoters and investors because proof of mere investing was insufficient to sustain a conviction. Likewise, the court held &sect; 44-1731 was not overbroad because the state was entitled to regulate inherently fraudulent conduct, even among family members and social acquaintances and without regard to the degree of sophistication. Furthermore, the court held &sect; 44-1731 was not unlawful as a strict liability statute because &sect; 44-1731 had been enacted to protect the public from the inevitable losses incurred in pyramid schemes. Finally, the court held the coconspirators' statements had been properly admitted because the state had introduced sufficient reliable evidence of the conspiracy and defendant's participation therein.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 10 1/2 years in prison. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The statutes defining first-degree murder, second-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide were not void for vagueness and did not violate defendant's rights to due process and equal protection of the laws. The admission of arguably gruesome photographs at defendant's trial was not erroneous because the photographs were probative on defendant's claim of self-defense. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for acquittal because there was substantial evidence to sustain his conviction. The trial court did not err in admitting an X-ray which the state had not disclosed until trial. The use of the X-ray evolved out of the testimony of a late-disclosed defense witness. There was no error in instructing the jury that defendant would not be subject to the death penalty. Although defendant's sentence was greater than that recommended by the presentence report, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in giving defendant a 10 1/2 year sentence.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to prison for a term of 40 to 50 years. At the time of the prisoner's offense, a sentence of one year to life was authorized. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. Thereafter, he filed a petition for post-conviction relief seeking to have his sentence modified on the ground that his sentence was excessive to the point of being cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. The trial court granted the prisoner's petition and sentenced him to a term of 15 to 30 years. The state filed a petition for review. The court vacated the trial court's order and reinstated the original sentence. The court noted that successful challenges to the proportionality of particular sentences should be exceedingly rare and that it was appropriate for a court to interfere only in the most extreme cases. Furthermore, a sentence that was within the statutory limits was not cruel and unusual punishment when the statute fixing the punishment was constitutional. The court found that the statute under which the prisoner was sentenced did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the petition. On review, the court reversed. The court found that Ariz. Rev.

A juvenile court's findings with respect to grounds for termination must have been based on clear and convincing evidence. The evidence was insufficient to support an order of termination under any standard of proof, and the case was reversed. A finding of abandonment under Ariz. Rev.
