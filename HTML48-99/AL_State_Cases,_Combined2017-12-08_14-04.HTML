</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Disagreement between plaintiffs oil companies and defendant petroleum retailer concerned requirements of the Alabama Motor Fuel Marketing Act (AMFMA) when the wholesale price of motor fuel was on the rise.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed suit for a judgment declaring that 1998 Ala. Acts 312 (Act), which called for annexation of certain territory from plaintiff's police jurisdiction by defendant's jurisdiction, was void as repugnant to Alabama law and unconstitutional. The trial court entered summary judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed, the court affirming in part and reversing in part. Although the description of the territory to be annexed contained typographical errors, the information was substantially accurate and, therefore, was not invalid under the Alabama Constitution. However, because the legislature chose to provide a general law regarding police jurisdiction in Ala. Code &sect; 11-42-10, &sect; 2 of the Act violated Ala. Const. of 1901, &sect; 105, which prohibited legislation through a local act on a subject that had been subsumed by a general law. Therefore, the court held that &sect; 2 of the Act should be stricken, with the remainder of the Act left intact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, because one section of the act at issue legislated through local law on a subject that had been subsumed by a general law; thus, that section of the act was stricken, with the remainder of the act left intact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the Supreme Court of the United States, the court reviewed Alabama's franchise tax scheme in light of the Supreme Court's finding that Alabama's franchise tax scheme facially discriminated against interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, several foreign corporations, filed separate actions against defendant State Department of Revenue, alleging that Alabama's franchise-tax scheme discriminated against foreign corporations in a way that violated the Commerce Clause of the Constitution of the United States. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' claims. The court affirmed without opinion. Plaintiffs petitioned the United States Supreme Court, which granted certiorari and reversed, holding that Alabama's franchise-tax scheme was discriminatory on its face and as applied under the Commerce Clause. The case was remanded. The court rendered an interim order to guide the legislature in prospective franchise tax legislation in light of the decision by the United States Supreme Court. The court held that the discrimination against interstate commerce was not the result of constitutional provisions found at &sect;&sect; 229 and 232 of the Alabama Constitution, but the result of interpretations by the court and as applied by the executive department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rendered an interim order for the guidance of the legislature in discharging its duties for prospective taxation. Future legislation must use substantially equivalent tax bases for domestic and foreign corporations, and must set a tax rate for foreign corporations that is not higher than that for domestic corporations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed an adverse judgment based upon a jury determination that defendants were liable for the wrongful death of decedent, contending that the trial court improperly admitted evidence, that the verdict was excessive, and that the construction of Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-410, providing only for punitive damages, was unconstitutional. In affirming, the court concluded that the expert testimony of an investigating officer was not improperly admitted. Expert qualifications and the scope of expert testimony are within the trial court's discretion; absent palpable abuse, matters of discretion are not disturbed. Further, the court declined to revisit the long-standing conclusion that wrongful death actions are intended to punish the wrongdoer and that an award of punitive damages furthers the legislative purpose. While Alabama law imposed no limits on the amount awarded, the court compared the award to others. Determining that the award was higher than awards affirmed on appeal, a remittitur was ordered.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 40-9B-1 to -8 (1975), were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tax law allowed defendant public authorities to grant tax abatements. The lower courts found that plaintiffs had no case, and that the law did not violate the state constitution. The court agreed in a consolidated appeal, even though the legislature could not allow such public corporations to levy taxes. The court found that tax abatements were not taxes, because they did not take property without the owner's consent. The state was also not lending money or engaging in works of internal improvement, as prohibition only referred to the state as distinct from its political subdivisions. Nor was the statute a special or private law, because it did not apply to a specific individual or corporation, and it did not suspend a general law for the benefit of a private corporation. Defendants' directors were not required to file statements of economic interests because their income was below the statutory requisite.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because the power to grant a tax abatement was not the same as the power to tax, the constitutional prohibition on the state lending money did not apply to counties or municipalities, and the economic interest reporting requirement only applied to public employees with income above a certain level.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff administratrix of decedent's estate sued for wrongful death. During the time the case was pending, the state amended its statute to require plaintiff's expert to be board certified in the same specialty as defendant. Plaintiff failed to name a new expert who met this standard. At trial, defendant's motion for summary judgment was granted. Plaintiff appealed, claiming the retroactive application of the statute was unconstitutional. In affirming the decision, the court ruled that the statute was remedial in nature as it did not create, enlarge, or diminish any of plaintiff's vested rights. The only expert the plaintiff proffered was disqualified; and expert testimony was required as a matter of law to prove the alleged medical malpractice. Thus, the plaintiff could not prove the allegations of her complaint. Because she could not show that defendant had breached the standard of care, there was no genuine issue as to any material fact. Further, there was no substantial evidence of causation. Thus defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 5-19-22(a) (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff borrowers sued defendant lender to recover, as damages, interest they had paid on loans that they claimed violated Ala. Code &sect; 5-19-22(a) (1975) requiring lenders to be licensed. Five days after suit was filed, 1996 Ala. Acts 96-576 went into effect, amending Ala. Code &sect; 5-19-19 to remove private causes of action for failing to obtain a license. Defendant moved for judgment on the pleadings. The trial court granted the motion, and plaintiffs appealed. The appellate court reversed. Defendant was granted a writ of certiorari. Plaintiffs argued that Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 95 prevented the Legislature from barring their action. The court agreed. Since this case had been commenced on a viable cause of action, no subsequent act could take away the cause of action retroactively. Defendant argued that plaintiffs had failed to allege any damages. The court ruled that plaintiffs had indicated damages by being charged interest. By alleging that the measure of their damages was the total amount of interest they paid, plaintiffs necessarily claimed any lesser amount that may be deemed excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the appellate court and reinstated the pleadings to the extent that plaintiffs could recover excessive interest, as it ruled that plaintiffs' cause of action could not be removed under the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's wife died from complications resulting from a gastric bypass surgery to treat her obesity. Plaintiff brought suit against defendant doctors, alleging that defendants failed to manage her post-operative infection and that this failure resulted in her death. A jury awarded plaintiff two million in damages. The trial court denied defendants' motions for a new trial, judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and remittur. The court affirmed. The trial court did not err in striking a veniremember for cause who indicated that she was a former patient of one of the defendants. The relationship of a physician and a patient constituted prima facie evidence of probable prejudice on the part of the veniremember. The trial court also did not err in failing to grant a new trial when a jury member gave post-trial testimony that she failed to respond accurately during voir dire. The trial court had not abused its discretion in determining that defendants were not prejudiced by the jury member's failure to make full disclosure on a certain issue. The damages award was not excessive because it was not disproportionate to the loss of life caused by defendants' malpractice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed an order of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which held, among other things, that 1985 Ala. Acts 983 was unconstitutional because it violated the substantive due process rights of certain suppliers and consumers. Further, defendants appealed the trial court's order, which refused to dismiss, as parties, defendant citizens and certain named defendant suppliers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1985 Ala. Acts 983 (the Act) was intended to prevent the unnecessary duplication of facilities that supplied retail electric service across the state. Plaintiffs filed a suit seeking to declare the Act constitutional, while defendants challenged the Act on constitutional grounds. The trial court held that the Act was unconstitutional and refused to dismiss defendant citizens and certain named defendant suppliers from the action. On appeal, the court found that the Act's provisions were rationally related to the legislature's legitimate concern with preventing the economic, environmental, and safety costs that were inherent in the duplication of electric-distribution facilities. Therefore, the Act was a valid exercise of the state's police power and did not suffer from any of the constitutional infirmities asserted by defendant opponents. Further, the court concluded that those citizens of the state having no cognizable interest in the action were not proper parties. However, the named defendant suppliers were directly governed by the Act and were proper parties. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order, which held that the legislative act was unconstitutional, was reversed because the act constituted a valid exercise of the legislature's power to enact economic regulatory statutes. Further, the order refusing to dismiss the defendant citizens was reversed because they were not proper parties. However, that part of the order, which refused to dismiss the name defendant suppliers, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, individual owners of independent drug stores in two Alabama counties, brought the underlying action alleging damage resulting from a conspiracy to control the price of brand-name prescription drugs shipped by the appellants, various drug manufacturers, drug wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, and mail-order companies from out-of-state. Appellees alleged that appellants, all foreign corporations, set a discriminatory pricing scheme. The trial court rejected appellants' motion for a judgment on the pleadings and ruled that Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-60 (1975) provided appellees with a cause of action for damages resulting from the alleged conspiracy. The court, after an exhaustive review of the legislative history of Alabama antitrust law, concluded that the trial court erred in its interpretation of the &sect; 6-5-60. The court found that the legislature could not have intended the statute to apply to interstate commerce, which is solely regulated by federal law, but that the statute could only apply to intrastate commerce.

Plaintiff used citric acid in its bottling operation. Defendants were in the business of selling citric acid. Plaintiff sued defendants under Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-60 (1975), alleging a conspiracy to control the price of citric acid shipped into Alabama. The trial court denied defendants' motion to dismiss under Ala. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and defendants requested permission to appeal the trial court's order of denial under Ala. R. App. P. 5. The reviewing court reversed and remanded, holding that although Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-60 (1975) was not limited on its face to intrastate transactions, a review of its history and the state of federal constitutional law at the time of its enactment indicated that it was so limited. The reviewing court entertained a strong presumption that the Alabama legislature was aware when it enacted the statute that it lacked the ability to regulate interstate antitrust activity. It also found that the state courts of appeal had upheld this limitation, and that the legislature had made no substantive changes to the state antitrust laws since their original enactment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the trial court's interlocutory order denying defendants' motion to dismiss, holding that the Alabama code only provided a cause of action for damage allegedly resulting from a conspiracy to control the price of goods shipped in intrastate commerce even though the statute was not limited on its face to transactions involving intrastate commerce.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 20-2-93 to condemn as contraband appellant's vehicle. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss the petition arguing that the condemnation violated the prohibition against excessive fines. The trial court granted appellee's motion to condemn the vehicle, and the court of appeals affirmed the decision. On writ of certiorari to the supreme court, appellant contended that the forfeiture violated the Excessive Fines Clause of U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 15. The supreme court reversed the lower court's decision and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court found that it had to compare the amount of the forfeiture to the gravity of appellant's offense. If the amount of the forfeiture was grossly disproportional to the gravity of appellant's defense, it was unconstitutional. The court concluded that the forfeiture of the vehicle was six times the amount of the maximum fine assessed by the legislature. Therefore, the forfeiture was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs initiated a class action for refunds of taxes paid on retirement benefits. Plaintiffs alleged the state's practice of exempting certain state retirees from income tax on retirement benefits while taxing private retirees' benefits violated Ala.

Plaintiffs did not establish that the tax structure violated amendment 25. The state proved that the tax structure was related to a legitimate state objective such that the structure did not violate the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under state law, individuals were prohibited from serving on city school boards if they were also subject to the authority of the board. A separate provision of the same statute prohibited more than one teacher from serving on a school board at one time. Appellant state argued that appellee teacher's position on a city school board violated the statute. The court first agreed with appellant's stipulation that the provision prohibiting more than one teacher from serving on the school board was unconstitutional. The court then acknowledged that the statute contained no severability provision. However, applying rules of statutory construction, the court held that the provision prohibiting school board membership to anyone subject to the board's authority was severable from the unconstitutional provision because the valid provision was complete and capable of execution standing alone. Because appellee teacher was subject to the authority of the board in violation of the valid provision, the court held the trial court erred in denying appellant's petition for a writ of quo warranto.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff at-will employees sued defendant restaurant corporation and defendant restaurant managers. Plaintiffs sought money damages for invasion of privacy, outrage, assault and battery, and negligent training and supervision.

Plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint naming an employment dispute service company as a defendant and claiming damages for fraud in the inducement. After a hearing on the motion to dismiss or to compel arbitration, the trial court denied the motion. Defendants challenged that decision. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded and held that the trial court should have compelled arbitration. Defendants made a prima facie showing that they were entitled to arbitrate plaintiffs' claims. Plaintiffs presented no evidence tending to rebut that prima facie showing.

The trial court entered judgment in favor of appellees, but the appellate court reversed in favor of appellants. The court agreed that appellees had standing to file the suit because the burden was on the businesses to collect, calculate, and remit the taxes under penalty of liability for any errors. The statute was constitutional because appellees were represented in the legislature to the extent they participated in elections of members of the legislature.

In a similar action against defendant by another party, that court ruled that defendant was not liable for punitive damages.

The lower court granted defendant's motion, so plaintiff appealed. The appellate court dismissed the appeal because under Ala. R. Civ. P. 54(b), certification of finality was ineffective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, convicted of rape in the first degree for having had sexual intercourse with his then 11-year-old daughter, was sentenced as a habitual felony offender. Petitioner appealed his conviction, which was affirmed by the criminal appeals court, then filed a petition for certiorari review that was granted. Petitioner contended the appeals court had erred in holding the trial court did not unconstitutionally apply Alabama's rape-shield law by excluding evidence that petitioner found indicated that a third person had engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim. The court affirmed the judgment of the criminal appeals court and found this testimony properly excluded, but excluded it on different grounds. The court looked at the legislative history of Ala. R. Evid. 412 to find it was intended to expand the Alabama rape shield law to include opinion evidence regarding the victim's character. But the court also overruled an absolute exclusion to all evidence of past sexual activity between the victim and third persons where the exclusion would violate a criminal defendant's constitutional rights, requiring a case-by-case application of Ala. R. Evid. 412.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the criminal appeals court against the petitioner and the finding that the third person rapist testimony was prejudicial, but affirmed on different grounds because an absolute application of the rape shield law could violate criminal defendants' constitutional rights. The court stated that a case-by-case application of the updated Alabama rape shield law was required and overruled all contrary prior rulings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee retained appellant to filed a personal injury action for her. Appellee signed a contingency-fee contract. Appellant settled the case and appellee filed a malpractice action alleging breach-of-contract, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation.

The day before a scheduled pretrial conference, appellant sent a motion for continuance. The court affirmed the default judgment and denial of appellant's motion that the trial judge recuse himself. Appellant's claim of bias was a mere accusation. The record indicated the trial judge conducted the proceedings in an impartial manner. The court reversed the trial judge's refusal to review the question of excessiveness of damages. Appellant properly challenged the amounts of compensatory and punitive damages. The order denying appellant's post-trial motion did not address whether the evidence supporting the punitive award was clear and convincing as required by Ala. Code &sect; 6-11-20 (1975).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted on six counts of capital murder, all based on the death of his ex-wife. After multiple appeals, remands, and re-sentencings, the appeals court affirmed the convictions and the death sentence given to petitioner. Petitioner appealed and sought certiorari review, which was granted. At petitioner's last re-sentencing, the trial court had allowed the jury to separate over petitioner's objection, in spite of Ala. R. Crim. P. 19.3, which allowed the separation of jurors in capital trials upon agreement of all parties. The appeals court had found that Ala. Code &sect; 12-16-9 controlled, which stated that the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure took precedence over statutory provisions, and thus, no error occurred when the trial court allowed the jury to separate over the petitioner's objection. The court evaluated the applicable statutes, construed Ala. Code &sect; 12-1-1, and held that a statute superceded a rule only where there was clear conflict. Thus, the trial court had not committed error when it allowed the capital jury to separate because that question was to be resolved by them under Ala. Code &sect; 12-16-9 (1995). The appeals court judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the county's summary judgment motion on the employee's Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 621 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Proceedings to review the employee's termination of employment by the county were governed by 1945 Ala. Acts 376, as amended by 1977 Ala. Acts 1176. Review of the administrative board's decision was limited to questions of law and whether or not the board's decision was supported by substantial and legal evidence and was limited to questions within the board's authority, which did not include arguments that the board's action violated constitutional or statutory provisions. As a result, the employee's only way to raise constitutional and statutory arguments, such as a violation of the ADEA, was by a collateral suit. He was not required to raise his ADEA claim before the board, given its lack of authority to decide such a claim, or before the circuit court, whose review was limited to the proceedings before the board. This did not apply to actions governed by the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act, Ala. Code &sect; 41-22-1 et seq., because, under Ala.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation contended that Ala. Code &sect; 40-14-41 (1975) imposed on foreign corporations doing business in Alabama a higher tax than was imposed on domestic corporations. Consequently, it contended, that &sect; 40-14-41 violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, in that it impermissibly burdened interstate commerce. It also contended that &sect; 40-14-41 discriminated against it, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. It also argued that the injunction was necessary because without it the corporation faced an imminent risk of irreparable injury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant partnership challenged a ruling by the Montgomery County Circuit Court (Alabama), which declared the state to be the owner of submerged land off the coast of an island where oil and gas wells were drilled, and thus the proper payee of appellee oil driller's proceeds from operations on the submerged lands. The trial court subsequently entered summary judgment in favor of the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The partnership contended that it acquired title to the submerged lands pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 33-7-53 (1975) in conjunction with an alleged quid pro quo dedication to the public use of the island and its payments of ad valorem taxes on the improvement line property. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling that granted summary judgment in favor of the state, finding that the partnership did not acquire title to the submerged land by virtue of &sect; 33-7-53. In so holding, the court found that 1) a riparian owner can in some situations acquire title to submerged lands by artificial filling; 2) the legislature intended, through &sect; 33-7-53 to provide a means whereby the partnership could acquire title to the submerged lands by filling or artificial accretion; 3) the partnership's mere publication of its intent to effect and artificial accretion did not satisfy &sect;33-7-53; 4) &sect; 33-7-53 required not only the publication of the intent to fill, reclaim, or otherwise improve submerged land, but the actual accomplishment of the published intent; 5) the partnership never consummated an agreement with the owner of the improvement line property for an exchange of property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the trial court's ruling that granted summary judgment in favor of the state and held that the partnership did not acquire title to the submerged lands. The court found that while the partnership published its intention to acquire title to the submerged lands by virtue of artificial accretion, in order to claim title to the lands, the actual accomplishment of the intent was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The law at issue, 1991 Ala.

Const. &sect; 104 prohibited the legislature from passing local laws that regulated tax assessment or collection. The supreme court found that 1991 Ala. Acts 491 was a &quot;local law&quot; under Ala. Const. &sect; 110 which applied only to the parties' county; was a direct attempt to alter Ala. Code ch. 10, tit. 40's uniform general system of collecting taxes through the sale and redemption of land; and was therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The United States Supreme Court vacated and remanded the punitive damage award. On remand, the court further remitted the punitive award and again affirmed the circuit court's original judgment. The circuit court ruled in favor of plaintiff in a subsequent motion which alleged that defendant still owed postjudgment interest on the punitive award. The court affirmed the circuit court's determination that interest on the punitive award began to accrue 30 days after the original judgment was entered. The court held that its alteration of the original judgment on remand did not change the fact that interest was calculated from the date of the original judgment because the Supreme Court's order did not void that judgment. The court reversed the order insofar as defendant's payment for compensatory damages was applied toward the entire judgment, rather than the compensatory damage portion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant creditor appealed a decision from the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama), which entered an interlocutory order holding that a retroactive application of an amendment to Ala. Code &sect; 5-19-19 to plaintiff debtors' claims would violate Ala. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 13, 22 and Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 95 in the debtors' class action for damages after they were charged excessive finance charges in their consumer home mortgage loans with the creditor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditor made consumer home mortgage loans to the debtors. The named plaintiffs filed a complaint, alleging that the creditor had violated Ala. Code &sect; 5-19-4(g), which prohibited creditors from charging &quot;points&quot; in excess of 5 percent of the original principal balance of the loan. The creditor charged 8 percent. Through discovery, 910 members of the plaintiff class were identified. The debtors, acting pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 5-19-19, demanded a refund of the finance charges. The creditor did not respond. Meanwhile, &sect; 5-19-19 was amended to reduce the amount of damages recoverable by debtors who were charged excess finance charges. The trial court held that a retroactive application of the amendment to the debtors' claims was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the amendment was enacted after the contracts with the creditor had been consummated, after the action had been pending more than two years, and after the class had been certified. The court held that a retroactive change in &sect; 5-19-19 would unconstitutionally impair the obligations of the debtors' contracts, destroy vested rights, and take away the debtors' cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal the corporation alleged that the license ordinance upon which the city's tax assessment was based violated the commerce clause and due process clause of the United States Constitution because it authorized a tax based on the total gross receipts from sales made at facilities located outside the state. The city argued that it had the statutory authority to impose the tax and the duty to enforce it. The court held that the license ordinance violated the commerce clause. The court determined that the ordinance was not internally consistent because if local governments in other states were to have imposed license taxes based on gross receipts from sales made within their respective jurisdictions, then multiple state taxation of interstate commerce would have occurred. The court determined that the license tax ordinance created the possibility of multiple taxation and therefore was not fairly apportioned and there was not a necessity of a showing that any other state had actually imposed a license tax based on gross receipts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiffs school board members filed suit in the Calhoun Circuit Court (Alabama) against the defendant city seeking to have a city council resolution declared void.

The members appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The members argued that the trial court erred in finding that Ala. Code &sect; 16-11-3.1 (1975) was constitutional. The supreme court disagreed. The supreme court had a duty to avoid a constitutional question unless an answer to it was essential to the proper disposition of the case. The legislature had amended &sect; 16-11-3.1 so as to prevent the very practice of which the members complained, the removal of board members during their terms through the dissolution and restructuring of a city board of education. The members, neither of whom was still in office, were successful in having the resolution set aside. Even if the supreme court were to have addressed the issue presented and to have found the un-amended version of &sect; 16-11-3.1&nbsp;unconstitutional, no relief could have been afforded to either of the members. Therefore, the appeal was moot.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment holding that plaintiffs did not have standing because the funds involved were not state funds to the extent that a non-retirement system's member taxpayer would have standing to challenge their use. The court held that the retirement system assets were not state funds because Ala.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, state and insurance commissioner, appealed the judgment of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which ruled in favor of plaintiff insurance companies by finding that the tax credits given to a certain class of insurers pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 27-4A-3(a)(3)d.1 (1975) violated the Fourteenth Amendment and Ala. Const. &sect;&sect; 1, 35.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Insurance Premium Tax Reform Act of 1993 (Act), Ala. Code &sect; 27-4A-1 to -7 (1975), was passed, the insurance companies filed an action against defendants that alleged that the Act was unconstitutional by allowing credits based on an insurance company's investment in the state and the size of the company. The trial court agreed that the statute was unconstitutional, and the insurance companies appealed. The court reversed, holding that the credits set forth in Ala. Code &sect; 27-4A-3(a)(3) (1975) were based on objective criteria and that they were not discriminatory. Because acts of the legislature were presumed to be constitutional and because the legislature possessed the greatest freedom in classification in the fields of taxation, the insurance companies faced a heavy burden in proving that the classifications were invalid. After applying the rational relationship test to determine whether there was an equal protection violation, the court held that the classifications were valid because they were designed to encourage a reasonable state goal of promoting investment in the state and employment of state citizens, especially in rural areas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the judgment in favor of the insurance companies that determined that the tax credits given to a certain class of insurers violated the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, made capital pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(2) (1994) because the murder occurred during the commission of a first-degree robbery. After a nine to three vote by the jury recommending life imprisonment without parole, the trial judge overrode and sentenced defendant to death by electrocution. The Court of Criminal Appeals (Alabama) affirmed. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested in Montana on a separate crime and made spontaneous incriminating remarks about the murder. When they arrived in Alabama, confessed and led police to the body of the victim. The court rejected defendant's argument that his spontaneous remarks should have been suppressed because Miranda did not apply to voluntary statements. An unsolicited remark, not in response to any interrogation, did not fall within the Miranda rule. The protections afforded a suspect under Miranda applied only when the suspect was both in custody and being interrogated. Defendant was not entitled to a continuance to procure mental health records because the delay was caused by defendant's refusal to divulge their existence to his attorney. Defendant's flight to Montana was proper for the jury to consider because defendant left immediately after the murder. Even though the state argued that the victim was shot execution style, once in the back of the head, three times in the back, then twice in head, the court concluded that the murder was not &quot;especially heinous&quot; under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-49(8) (1994) and that the judge should not have overridden the jury recommendation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of capital murder, but reversed the sentence of death by electrocution and remanded to the court of criminal appeals to direct the trial court to reconsider all aggravating and mitigating circumstances, excluding the aggravating circumstance of &quot;especially heinous, atrocious or cruel.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(1) (1975). The trial court followed the jury recommendation of the death penalty, sentencing defendant to death by electrocution. In a unanimous decision, the court of criminal appeals (Alabama) affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court granted defendant's petition for a writ of certiorari, Ala. R. App. P. 39(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, and held that the court of criminal appeals, in determining whether autopsy photographs depicting the victim's body were properly admitted during the guilt phase, could properly consider the corroborative tendency of the photographs, although that had not been the reason offered by the prosecution for the admission of the photographs into evidence. Regarding the trial court's jury instruction that tracked the language from the kidnapping statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 13A-6-43(a)(4), (5) (1975), the court noted that the use of the term &quot;terrorize&quot; in the statute had been held not to render the kidnapping statute unconstitutionally vague. The trial court's erroneous finding that defendant was 23 rather than 21 years and 11 months old when he committed the crime, an error that defense counsel apparently did not bring to the trial court's attention, did not rise to the level of plain error, where defendant was clearly an adult, not a minor, when he killed the victim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer filed suit against the termite company under a four count complaint that included fraud, negligence, breach of contract, and fraudulent inducement. The circuit court denied the termite company's motion to compel arbitration on the breach of contract claim only. The case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court that held that the breach of contract claim was subject to arbitration. The court had then remanded the case to the circuit court to grant the termite company's motion to compel arbitration on the breach of contract claim. On remand, the termite company filed a motion to compel arbitration on all four counts. The circuit court denied the motion as to the fraud and negligence counts. On appeal, the court held (1) the doctrine of judicial estoppel prevented the termite company from assertion that the fraud and negligence counts were subject to arbitration when the termite company argued on the first appeal that it did not waive its right to arbitration on the breach of contract count because the fraud and negligence counts were not subject to arbitration, and (2) the circuit court had properly followed the court's order of remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the state and a circuit court judge, petitioned for a writ of mandamus and challenged the judgments of the Montgomery County Circuit Court (Alabama), which declared certain aspects of the judge's decorum and practice to violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This appeal was the consolidation of several cases involving the practice of a circuit court judge of displaying a plaque in his courtroom depicting the Ten Commandments and having prayer prior to court. In one case, the state filed a complaint against the judge and a legal association challenging the practices, and in another action the legal association filed a claim against the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama for failing to control the circuit judge's conduct. The court held that the claim of the state was not justiciable where the state and the circuit court judge were not adversaries and that the judge's practices were constitutional; the state did not really seek to interfere with the judge's practices, but rather sought to obtain permission to perpetuate his conduct. This action lacked even facial adverseness and therefore did not present a true case or controversy. The claim against the Chief Justice was also nonjusticiable where he did not have the authority or power to provide the relief sought by the legal association. Therefore, trial court lacked jurisdiction, and the judgments were void and nonappealable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgments as void and dismissed the appeals.</SPAN></P>

On April 30, 1993, the trial court entered a $ 4.5 million judgment. On August 18, 1995, the court held &sect; 6-5-547&nbsp;unconstitutional and reinstated the April 30, 1993, judgment, but ordered a remittitur to $ 2.5 million, which the administrator accepted. The court affirmed the judgment. The trial court held that interest continued to accrue on the entire judgment principal until the judgment plus all accrued postjudgment interest was paid. Both parties sought review. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the action to the trial court. The final judgment in this case was entered on April 30, 1993. Interest on the remitted judgment (the $ 2.5 million judgment) accrued from the date the trial court entered the original judgment. The three payments the hospital had made were treated as partial payments on the judgment from the time paid, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 8-8-11 (1975).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor and State Board of Education contended that the Reese Fee Order, which stated that the non-profit organization, advocacy program, and individual were entitled to costs and expenses but did not give an amount, was interlocutory and therefore not final to trigger the application of Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). The court agreed with this contention; however, the court found that the Liability Phase order, which formed the basis for the Reese Fee Order, was a judgment that supported an appeal. Further, the court construed the Greenhaw Fee Order (the subsequent order that stated the exact fee amounts) as constituting an independent review of the Reese Fee Order. The non-profit organization, advocacy program, and individual who prevailed on the pivotal question of federal constitutional law that was the basis for the entire action, were entitled to an award of attorney fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The recovery of attorney fees in Alabama was allowed only where authorized by statute, when provided in a contract, or by special equity. When a statute was applicable, fees were to be awarded pursuant to the statute.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court affirmed the reinstatement orders. On appeal, the court affirmed and ruled (1) that the reinstatement orders were supported by substantial evidence that each employee had an excellent employment record on which the panels could have relied to determine that termination of employment was inappropriate, and thus there was no abuse of discretion; (2) that the Fair Dismissal Act (FDA), Ala. Code &sect; 36-26-100 et seq. (1975), did not violate Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The act provided that jurors were to be selected from the county at large.

Conversely, &sect; 6 allowed a jury to be chosen from a district within a county. Moreover, the act was unconstitutional with regard to the civil litigants because once the offending portion of the act was severed, there remained nothing enforceable in the act. The act also violated Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 105 because the act was a local act that had been subsumed by a general act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the trial court properly denied insurer's motions as to both the fraudulent suppression and misrepresentation claims. The court found that insurer's agent, and through him, the insurer, had a duty to disclose that, because of insureds' age and poor health, the new policies that they were purchasing were of less value to them than their original policies. Under the facts, the jury could thus have concluded that as a result of the insurer's agent's failure to disclose these facts the insureds were induced to change their insurance, when they might not otherwise have done so. The court also held that the facts supported the finding that the agent's misrepresentation as to the limitation of the new policies was intentional. It was clear that insureds relied upon the agent to inform them about the effect of cashing in the original policy, and their reliance was particularly justified in view of their age, health, and lack of education. The court could not review the trial court's ruling that the punitive damages awarded by the jury were not excessive because its reasons were not in the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and remanded for the trial court to put into the record its reasons for finding that the punitive damages award was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant employer sought review of a judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) in favor of plaintiff employee in her suit for damages based on fraudulent misrepresentation and fraudulent suppression. Plaintiff appealed the trial court's order requiring a remittitur of the punitive damages award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee worked for defendant employer as an account representative. Most of plaintiff's compensation came from the commissions that she earned by meeting the quarterly sales quotas set by defendant. After the commissions plaintiff received for three quarters were lower than she expected, plaintiff discovered that defendant had manipulated the sales figures and thereby underpaid the commissions. After a trial, a jury awarded plaintiff compensatory damages on her fraud claim, along with punitive damages. Plaintiff received nothing on her claim for breach of contract. Defendant argued that the award of punitive damages was unjustified because the record did not show that its actions were gross, oppressive, or malicious and that the amount of the award was constitutionally excessive. In affirming the award of punitive damages, the court found that defendant's activities were not merely the result of accidents and mistakes. The court further held that a reduction in the amount of the award was warranted and that the resulting award was neither excessive nor unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court judgment conditioned upon plaintiff employee's acceptance of a further reduction of the punitive award. The court ruled that if plaintiff did not file a remittitur of punitive damages, then defendant employer should be granted a new trial. The court concluded that the reduced award did not exceed the outer limit permissible under the due process clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Supreme Court remanded the case for an examination of the reasonableness of the punitive damages awarded to plaintiff insured in her suit against defendant insurer for intentional and reckless fraud and fraudulent suppression.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer's representative sold a Medicare supplement policy to the insured despite knowledge that she was on Medicaid and did not need the coverage. In the insured's suit for fraud, the jury awarded $ 15 million in punitive damages. The punitive damage award was remitted by the trial and appellate courts. The U.S. Supreme Court remanded the remitted punitive damage award for reconsideration. The court evaluated the degree of reprehensibility of the insurer's conduct and the ratio of punitive damages to the amount of actual harm suffered by the insured. The court compared the punitive damage award with the limited civil and criminal penalties that could be imposed for comparable misconduct. The court reviewed: (1) whether there was a reasonable relationship between the punitive damage award and the harm from the insurer's conduct; (2) the reprehensibility of the insurer's conduct; (3) the profitability of the conduct to the insurer; (4) the insurer's financial position; (5) costs of litigation; (6) the imposition of criminal sanctions on the insurer; and (7) other damage awards against the insurer. The court concluded that a punitive damage award of $ 3 million was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The compensatory damage and the punitive damage awards were affirmed on condition that the insured submit an order remitting the punitive damage award to $ 3 million. If no remittitur was filed within 28 days of the opinion, the judgment for the insured was to be reversed and the insurer granted a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The mother filed two wrongful death complaints against the municipality, alleging that it had negligently constructed, designed, or maintained the bridge and roadway on which the fatal accident occurred. The trial judge dismissed the mother's actions, holding that she was not the custodial parent at the time of the children's deaths. On appeal, the mother argued that the emergency order placing temporary custody in the father did not divest her of legal custody. The court held that the trial court's emergency order was a pendente lite order and not a final order and therefore, did not divest the mother of custody for purposes of Ala.

Plaintiff debtor husband cross-appealed from the denial of his motion for a new trial. The debtors had sought damages against the lender bank based on allegations of breach of contract and fraud.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lender had originally received a jury verdict on its complaint against the debtors that sought a judgment on a promissory note and a judicial foreclosure on mortgages. The debtors alleged that the lender fraudulently induced them to enter into loans and mortgages by falsely representing that the debtors could pay for construction of their residence, when a substantial portion of the loan proceeds were actually used by the lender to pay off unsecured business-related loans of debtor husband. Ultimately, this all led to demise of the business, the loss of the debtors' source of income, bankruptcy, the loss of their home, and the forced return to work for debtor wife. The lender's judgment was reversed and the matter was remanded for a new trial on the debtors' claims. On appeal of the new judgments, the court affirmed. The court held that the facts, when viewed in a light most favorable to the verdict, were sufficient to allow the jury to find that the lender's actions had set in motion the chain of events that ultimately led to the damages claimed. Further, the one-to-one ratio of compensatory damages to punitive damages was not unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment to the debtor wife, and it also affirmed the decision denying the debtor husband's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The jury found for the buyer, awarding compensatory damages and $ 4,000,000 in punitive damages. On appeal, the court found the punitive award excessive and reduced it to $ 2 million. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and found that the manufacturer's action was not highly reprehensible, emphasizing that the buyer was a successful medical doctor who was not financially vulnerable and had suffered meager economic damages. The Supreme Court concluded that the manufacturer could not have reasonably anticipated that its actions could incur such a large punitive damages award and that its due process rights were violated. On reconsideration, the court assessed the award in light of the Supreme Court's enunciated excessiveness standard, and held that the manufacturer's conduct did not justify such a large penalty. The court thus affirmed the trial court's order denying the manufacturer a new trial conditioned on the buyer's remittitur to the sum of $ 50,000.</SPAN></P>

Because Senate Bill 585 applied to the counties, and not the municipalities, it was a local law. Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 104(14) prohibited the legislature from fixing the punishment for a crime in a local law. Because Senate Bill 585 fixed the punishment for a violation of the crime that it authorized the two county commissions to create, it violated Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 104(14).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered two of the questions asked by the Senate, stating that the proposed bill was a local bill and that it ran afoul of the constitutional provision prohibiting a local law from the punishment of a crime. It declined to answer the remaining questions asked by the Senate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During defendant's retrial for murder, defendant asked questions of some venirepersons as to whether they would automatically vote to impose death if defendant was convicted of a capital crime. However, defendant claimed that the trial court did not allow defendant to ask such questions of all venirepersons, and that the trial court asked its own questions on the subject to some venirepersons. The court concluded that the trial court allowed defendant to ask such questions of the venirepersons, and only interceded where defendant's questions were confusing or misleading. The court found no error or abuse of the trial court's discretion in asking such questions. The court found constitutional the cap on attorney's fees for out-of-court work pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 15-12-21(d) because it applied only to out-of-court work and not to payment of other out-of-court expenses. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, but allowed defense counsel to submit a list of expenses to the trial court for a determination of whether the overhead expenses claimed were reasonably incurred in regard to defendant's second trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ambulance companies and other medical providers brought an action against the Commissioner of the Alabama Medicaid Agency and the state challenging limitations to Medicare Part B reimbursements. The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the ambulance companies and other medical providers and the Commissioner of the Alabama Medicaid Agency and the state sought review. On review, the court noted that Ala. Const. art.

The court found that the Commissioner of the Alabama Medicaid Agency and the state did not fall within any categories of exceptions and were not in bad faith or following an improper motivation in limiting the reimbursements. Thus, while the limitations on the rates of reimbursements were in violation of federal law, the state could not be compelled to pay reimbursements to the prevailing companies and providers from the state treasury.</SPAN></P>

Acts 1054. The landowners contended that the Act was unconstitutional because it treated them differently than other similarly situated landowners. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) held that the Act was unconstitutional, and the city sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under 1975 Ala. Acts 1054, a municipality's board of zoning adjustment in a county with a population over 500,000 could not grant a zoning variance except as specifically provided by that municipality. The city's ordinances did not provide for any of the use variances that the landowners had requested. On review, the court reversed, holding that the Act did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution because the population classification bore a reasonable relationship to the statutory purpose of providing cities located in heavily populated counties with a greater ability to regulate land use. The court recognized that densely inhabited regions might need special laws not applicable to rural areas. The court rejected the landowners' contention that the Act was a local law addressing the same subject covered in Ala. Code &sect; 11-52-80 (1975), which provided for municipal zoning laws, in violation of Ala. Const. &sect; 105. Rather, the Act was a general law enacted in good faith with a population standard that was reasonably related to the Act. Further, the Act did not violate the separation of powers doctrine stated in Ala. Const. art. III, &sect; 43.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mobile home purchasers filed a fraud action against defendant insurance companies that arose from separate purchases of mobile homes. Plaintiffs financed their mobile homes and insurance was required under the terms of their financing agreements. It was orally represented to plaintiffs when they purchased their policies that their first year of coverage did not require the payment of a premium. Plaintiffs brought actions for misrepresentation and suppression because defendants failed to disclose that coverage for adjacent structures, personal liability, medical payments, or damage to property of others was included in their policies. Defendants filed motions for a directed verdict and claimed that plaintiffs' claims were time-barred. The evidence indicated that it was not until the early part of 1994 that plaintiffs actually learned from their attorney that they had paid for their first year's coverage. The court found that plaintiffs had purchased adjacent structures coverage and that the trial court properly declined to hold as a matter of law that the claims were barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment conditioned upon the acceptance by the mobile home purchasers of a remittitur of compensatory and punitive damages.

The court affirmed the decision in part and held that defendant waived any right it may have had to compel arbitration by substantially invoking the litigation process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state parties including governor, state finance director, state board of education, and next friend in a suit by the state coalition for equity in a suit regarding challenges to public education funding sought permission to appeal overruled motions to dismiss and vacate the school funding remedy plan. The court granted permission to appeal, affirmed liability, vacated the remedy plan, and denied the petition for writ of prohibition. The court explained the remedy plan had to be vacated and remanded because although the lower court did not lack the power to implement a remedy plan once the funding system was found invalid, it nevertheless abused its discretion in doing so before allowing coordinate branches of government an opportunity to act. The court further explained the judiciary should not have presumed at the outset that legislative and executive officials would be derelict in their duties. The court observed the legislature bears the primary responsibility for devising a constitutionally valid public school system. The court rejected the argument that the judiciary's exercise of jurisdiction over the remedy phase of the suit violated separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The planning commission indicated the lot owners could receive permission to build an apartment complex if they bought the lot. The lot owners made the purchase and the commission delayed the decision. The city passed an ordinance that rezoned the area. The planning commission denied the lot owner's permission but granted a permit for a larger complex that was similarly situated on the same street. The lot owners filed suit. The parties filed summary judgment motions. The circuit court awarded summary judgment to the city. The lot owners appealed. The court reversed. The court found that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the constitutional challenge to the ordinance because the lot owners failed to notify the attorney general's office of the challenge. There was substantial evidence that the planning commission had arbitrarily and capriciously delayed the application based on one commissioner's admissions. Two similarly situated individuals had been granted permits, which indicated that there was an equal protection violation. Because the lot owners presented substantial evidence that created genuine issues of material fact, the city was not entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue on appeal of petitioner landowner's action that challenged the constitutionality of a rezoning ordinance was whether the trial court's judgment upholding the rezoning of the property by respondent city from a classification that permitted multi-family dwellings to a classification that restricted the property's use to single-family dwellings was palpably wrong, as was held by the Court of Civil Appeals (Alabama).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment that upheld the constitutionality of a rezoning ordinance and remanded the case holding that the judgment of the trial court was palpably wrong in finding that the landowner had failed to prove that the city's action in downzoning the landowner's property was arbitrary and capricious, and that the city failed to establish a substantial relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose in downzoning the property. The appellate court's judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for action consistent with the court's opinion. The court found credible evidence to support the trial court's holding that the rezoning was not arbitrary and capricious. Notably, the case presented no question of transitional spot zoning or the creation of zoning islands. It was determined that the trial court could have concluded that the city counsel, in rezoning the property to conform to its current use, acted to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community. There was also no known legal principle that required the city to give reasons in its minutes or to perform studies before adopting the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and held that the trial court did not err in dismissing the landowner's claims that the city's ordinance that rezoned property that included landowner's property constituted an unconstitutional taking of the property. Based on the foregoing, the cause was remanded to the appellate court for an order or proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The fugitive met the deputy at the door, but the deputy did not try to arrest him, instead calling for backup. The fugitive escaped and fled into a neighboring county, where he shot one plaintiff in the head, causing permanent injuries. On the officers' motion, the trial court dismissed the negligence counts of the complaint, but it refused to dismiss the counts based on willful conduct. The officers filed petitions for writs of mandamus, which the court granted. It was undisputed that both officers were acting in the scope and line of their employment when the fugitive made his escape. Thus, they were immune from suit under Ala. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On an expedited appeal, appellant State of Alabama, by and through relator district attorney, challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Baldwin (Alabama), which declared that 1975 Ala. Acts 841, which specified when the commissioners of appellee county were to begin their terms, was not subsumed by Ala. Code &sect; 11-3-1 (1975) and did not violate Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 105.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county's citizens elected seven commissioners at a general November election, which were to take office the following January pursuant to a local law, 1975 Ala. Acts 841. The State contended that the commissioners were due to be sworn in seven days after their election pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 11-3-1 (1975), which subsumed the unconstitutional local law. The circuit court declared that the local law did not violate the state constitution because &sect; 11-3-1 set forth an intention to preserve local law exceptions to the terms of office. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded by holding that Ala. Code &sect; 11-3-1(b) (1989) did not permit local law variations regarding when the term of office for county commissioners should commence. As the local law's subject matter dictating a January start to a commissioner's term of office was subsumed by &sect; 11-3-1(b), the local law violated the Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 105. In the absence of an express legislative intention to permit local law exceptions to Ala. Code &sect; 11-3-1(b) during the 1989 amendment process, the conflicting local law no longer controlled the time when the county's commissioners began their term of office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's judgment in favor of the county, ordered that the county's commissioners were to begin their terms immediately, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 27-10-2(b) as a matter of law for the adjustment of a claim issued by an insurer not authorized to provide policies within the state of Alabama. The adjuster appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured, a trucking company, obtained insurance but unknown to it, its insurer's agent obtained a policy for the insured from a company not authorized to write policies in the state of Alabama. The judgment holder's child was killed when involved in an accident with an insured vehicle, and the adjuster adjusted the claim in violation of &sect; 27-10-2(b) despite the fact that the company that provided coverage was not authorized to do so in Alabama. Appellees brought the current action against the adjuster for that violation to satisfy the judgment that the judgment holder obtained against the insured. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees after finding a violation of &sect; 27-10-2(b) as a matter of law. The adjuster appealed and claimed &sect; 27-10-2(b) was an unconstitutional violation of equal protection provisions. On appeal, the court affirmed and found the regulation of adjusters under &sect; 27-10-2(b) was constitutional. The court found that even if the statute imposed a &quot;willful conduct&quot; standard on an agent or broker and imposed a &quot;no fault&quot; standard of conduct on adjusters, such a standard was rationally related to a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State, by and through its acting finance director and comptroller, challenged an order of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which denied its petition for a writ of quo warranto, seeking to exclude appellee applicant from appointment as a supernumerary district attorney and granted the applicant's petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the State to pay him past and future compensation as a supernumerary district attorney.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant served 18 years as district attorney for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit before being elected to a term as attorney general of Alabama. He was serving as attorney general when he submitted his statutory declaration and documentary exhibits to the governor for appointment as a supernumerary district attorney. The State argued that, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 12-17-213(b) (1975), the applicant was not qualified for the appointment because he was not a sitting district attorney of a judicial circuit at the time of the appointment. The court disagreed, noting that, unlike other statutes concerning the qualifications an applicant for the office of supernumerary district attorney must meet, &sect; 12-17-213(b) did not, on its face, require that the applicant be holding the office of district attorney when he applied for the supernumerary position. In so ruling, the court noted that others in the applicant's position had been appointed as supernumerary attorney in the past. Further, &sect; 12-17-213(b) would have allowed him, if needed, to apply up to two and one-half years of service in his position of attorney general towards the 18-year minimum service requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner county commission members sought a writ of mandamus directing the Pike County Circuit Court (Alabama) to vacate its order in favor of respondent county commission members in a declaratory judgment action filed by respondents, which action sought a declaration that respondents' choice for commission chairman be allowed to continue as such and that under Ala. Code &sect; 11-3-20 (1975), he could cast any necessary tie-breaking votes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were three of the six members of the county commission, with respondents being the other three members. Respondents filed a declaratory action claiming that the commission's inability to elect a new chairman had shut down the operation of the county government, that petitioners refused to attend meetings, and that the commission could not function without a chairman. Petitioners' motion to continue was denied, and the circuit court entered an order in favor of respondents. Petitioners sought a writ of mandamus, which the court granted in part and denied in part, holding that: (1) there was no implied repeal of the &quot;holdover&quot; language of 1989 Ala. Acts 89-783 by the omission of such language in 1993 Ala. Acts 93-382 and thus, the acts had to be read in pari materia; and (2) that portion of Ala. Code &sect; 11-3-20 (1975) authorizing the chairman to determine the commission's vote deadlocks and 1993 Ala. Acts 93-382, providing for the election of the chairman from the commission membership, were repugnant and led to absurd results and thus, as the more recent act controlled, the deadlock resolution procedure of Ala. Code &sect; 11-3-20 (1975) was repealed as to Pike County.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence because the indictment was not constitutionally vague or fatally defective, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to grant the challenge for cause, the evidence was sufficient for a jury to find him guilty of capital murder, the jury instructions were proper, and the trial court correctly considered the robbery as an aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff administrator of decedent's estate brought a wrongful death action against defendant nursing home. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) entered an order concluding that any application of Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-551(1975) which prevented discovery where grievous injury or death of the infirm elderly might be recorded yet uncorrected violated the state and federal constitutions. The nursing home sought a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court determined that the Alabama Medical Liability Act applied and that, based upon Ala.

Assuming, but not deciding, that the trial judge ruled that &sect; 6-5-551 was unconstitutional, the court noted that the attorney general was not served pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 6-6-227 and Ala. R. App. P. 44. Therefore, any order holding Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-551&nbsp;unconstitutional was void. Section 6-5-551 required the administrator to include in the complaint a detailed specification and factual description of each act and omission alleged to render the health care provider liable and prohibited the administrator from conducting discovery with regard to any other act or omission or from introducing at trial evidence of any other act or omission.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the writ, and on review, reversed the judgment of the appellate court and remanded, finding that there was no evidence of a burglary in the case. The court ruled that it was error to instruct the jury that for purposes of determining whether defendant had committed a burglary, the fact that the victim had terminated defendant's privilege to be present in the her apartment could have been inferred from the circumstances that a struggle took place because the jury instruction had the effect of relieving the state of its burden of presenting a prima facie case of burglary.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 12-21-45, defendant premises owner, in a personal injury action, sought to introduce evidence that plaintiff claimant received from a collateral source payments for her medical expenses. The Calhoun Circuit Court (Alabama), ruled that Ala. Code &sect; 12-21-45 was unconstitutional. The matter was before the court on the premises owner's interlocutory appeal of that ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was injured when she slipped and fell on the premises owner's property. The claimant filed a personal injury action against the premises owner and filed a motion to declare Ala. Code &sect; 12-21-45&nbsp;unconstitutional. The trial court granted the claimant's motion, and the premises owner was permitted to file an interlocutory appeal. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 12-21-45 was unconstitutional. In so holding, the court concluded that the statute violated the right to a jury trial, set forth in Ala. Const. &sect; 11, as well as the guaranty of equal protection. The court explained that the statute violated equal protection guaranties because it allowed evidence of a plaintiff's insurance coverage but not of a defendant's; because it diminished awards to plaintiffs with insurance, even if their insurer was subrogated to the recovery, but provided no diminution in awards to wealthier plaintiffs who were self-insured; and because it undermined the fairness of the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee injured trucker filed an action against appellant trucking company, alleging that he was injured when his truck overturned while swerving to avoid a collision with appellant's truck that made an unlawful lane change. Appellee prevailed at trial and appellant sought review. The court affirmed. Appellant argued that appellee failed to present evidence that the tractor pulling the trailer alleged to have made the unlawful lane change belonged to appellant. The court restated its ruling in an earlier proceeding in this case that the fact that appellant's name was on the trailer that inflicted the injury was prima facie evidence that appellant owned the vehicle and that the driver was using it on appellant's behalf. The court found appellant unable to rebut the prima facie case. The court also rejected appellant's argument that the trial court improperly limited its impeachment of appellee, finding that the impeachment evidence was irrelevant because it did not relate to the accident and was intended only to show appellee's bad character. The court found no evidence of misconduct or improper motive to support appellant's allegation that the jury verdict was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of appellee injured trucker, holding that the fact that appellant trucking company's name was painted on the vehicle that caused appellee's injury was prima facie evidence, not rebutted by appellant, that the vehicle was owned by appellant and was being driven in its behalf. The court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's exclusion of appellant's impeachment evidence because it was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

After the transaction occurred as planned, police searched the residence pursuant to the warrant and seized the drugs that were the subject of the undercover transaction. The trial court denied defendant' s motion to suppress the drugs and defendant was convicted. The court reversed the conviction, holding that while anticipatory search warrants were not per se unconstitutional, the warrant that issued against defendant violated Ala. R. Crim. P. 3.8, which required that the crime underlying the search warrant had already been committed, and that the items sought were already in the possession of a suspect at the time a warrant issued.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The beneficiary filed a claim for life insurance proceeds when the insured was killed one month after purchasing a policy from the insurer. The insurer denied the claim contending that the insured had made a material misrepresentation by failing to disclose a DUI conviction from eight months prior to the insurance application and that it would not have issued the policy at the premium paid by the insured but for the misrepresentation. The insurer's denial letter enclosed a page from a policy manual which indicated that the policy would have been issued at the same rate. The beneficiary brought suit to collect on the policy. The trial court admitted the policy manual page, despite the insurer's claims that the wrong policy page had been attached to the letter and the denial was based on a different manual. The insurer claimed that several manuals were used by different underwriters. The jury returned a verdict for the beneficiary for the policy limits, punitive damages, and bad faith damages. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that the insurer could not rely upon its chosen method of &quot;subjective underwriting&quot; to justify denying a claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owner sold alcoholic beverages for off-premises consumption. Section 6-26 provided that the business had to pay a tax of 10 percent on all liquor purchases. State liquor outlets were exempt from the tax. The trial court agreed with the business owner that there was no rational basis for the unequal treatment between state liquor stores and private liquor stores. The court reversed the judgment, concluding that state liquor stores and private liquor stores were not &quot;similarly circumstanced&quot; for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause. Municipalities had no power to tax the state or its agencies without the state's consent. By refusing to consent to the local taxation of its liquor stores, the state had chosen to eliminate a potential financial burden on its exercise of this governmental function. In striking down &sect; 6-26, the trial court failed to take into consideration the long-standing deferential rationality standard for reviewing state tax legislation under the Fourteenth Amendment.The court thus deferred to the state's reasonable classification, for tax purposes, of the liquor stores and held that &sect; 6-26 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

After a jury trial, the insured was awarded compensatory and punitive damages, and accepted the trial court's remittitur reducing the punitive damages award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured prevailed on her claim that the insurer committed intentional and reckless fraud and fraudulent suppression by selling her a Medicare supplement insurance policy that was worthless to her because she was eligible for Medicaid. The insured was awarded compensatory damages and punitive damages of $ 15 million, which the trial court reduced on remittitur to $ 12.5 million. The insurer appealed the trial court's refusal to grant it a directed verdict on the issue of punitive damages. The court otherwise affirmed the judgment for the insured, but reduced the punitive damages award to $ 5 million. The court set out the guideline of seven factors that it reviewed to reach its conclusion that the insurer's conduct, while &quot;reprehensible,&quot; was not the &quot;most odorous&quot; the court had seen, in comparison to other offenses and accordingly reduced the punitive damages award. The court also announced that, prospectively, the determination of punitive damages in non-wrongful death cases, would happen through a bifurcated trial procedure and that half of all punitive damages awards in non-wrongful death cases would go into a state fund to be established.</SPAN></P>

Appellees sued appellant, alleging that appellant had violated the AMFMA, Ala. Code &sect; 8-22-1 et seq.

The lower court denied appellant's motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed the decision and held the AMFMA required appellant to establish a transfer price for gasoline transferred to company-operated stations. The court determined that any other interpretation of the AMFMA would defeat the purpose of the statute, which was to promote honest competition and to safeguard the public against the creation of monopolies in the sale of motor fuel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (board) sought review by certiorari of the decision of the Court of Civil Appeals (Alabama), which held that the board's retail sale of alcoholic beverages violated Ala. Const. of 1901 art. IV, &sect; 93 in plaintiff retailer's action for an order that the board cease the retail sale of alcoholic beverages and that the board refund the discounts that it received from liquor companies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retailer filed a complaint against the board for an order requiring the board to cease the operation of retail liquor stores and alleged that the board overcharged retailers by failing to pass on the discounts that it received and that the board lacked authority to buy or sell any product other than alcoholic beverages. The complaint also sought a refund for the discounts that the board received from liquor companies but were not passed on to the retail purchasers. The trial court held that the continued sale of intoxicating liquors did not violate &sect; 93 because intoxicating liquors were regulated within the police powers of the state and that the sale of any other items that contained no alcoholic content was not included in the police power and therefore was prohibited by &sect; 93. The appellate court held that the board was under no obligation to pass on the discounts. The court affirmed the portion of the decision relating to the discounts but reversed the holding that the board's sale of alcoholic beverages violated &sect; 93. 1980 Ala. Acts 80-529 did not indicate that the state liquor stores were abolished when the operation of privately owned stores was approved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment that held that whether to pass along discounts was within the discretion of the board, but it reversed the portion of the judgment that held that the board's retail sale of alcoholic beverages violated the constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">None of the individuals resided in Macon county and only one insurer, which was a defendant in each action, did business there. The court found that Ala. Code &sect; 6-3-5 made venue proper in the counties where the individuals resided, regardless of the claims alleged in their complaints. The court found that any complaints alleging contract claims were properly filed in Macon County, under Ala. Code &sect; 6-3-7; any complaints alleging personal injury claims only were subject to the clause in Ala. Code &sect; 6-3-7 that limited personal injury actions against domestic corporations (and, through Ala. Const. amend. 473, &sect; 232, foreign corporations) either to the county of the individual's residence or to the county where the wrongful act occurred. Therefore, the trial judge was directed to vacate his order transferring individuals' pending civil actions against insurers to another county. The court instructed the trial judge to then determine which complaints contained both contract claims and personal injury claims and to transfer those complaints which only alleged personal injury claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant insurance company sold cancer insurance policies that provided unlimited coverage for radiation, chemotherapy, and prescription drugs to fight cancer. Subsequently, defendant began a cancer policy exchange program whereby its agents attempted to persuade those with the old policies to switch to a new type of policy. Plaintiffs, class claimants, filed a lawsuit against defendant alleging a pattern and practice of fraud that caused holders of old cancer policies to exchange their policies for new cancer policies. The trial court entered a final order of the proposed class settlement. Approximately 400 objectors appealed arguing that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the objectors the right to a jury trial on their claims against defendant. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment holding that a class action without an opt-out provision did not violate the Alabama Constitution. The court also found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the settlement was fair, adequate, and reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owners challenged the annexation on the ground that the act providing for the annexation was not passed in accordance with Ala.

The trial court ruled that a legislative amendment after publication, which decreased the area to be annexed by approximately 28 percent, materially varied the substance of the bill from its advertised form and thereby violated &sect; 106. The court reversed and remanded. The material variance rule provided that if upon comparing the enacted law and the advertised bill, a court found material differences, then the entire law had to be declared invalid. After a review of the cases and the record, the court held that an annexation bill, whether notice of it had been published in summary or in detailed form, that did not provide for a referendum on a proposed annexation, could be amended by the legislature to eliminate a portion of the territory as described in the notice without violating &sect; 106.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder during the course of a robbery, made capital by Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2) (1975). He was sentenced to death. After return upon remand to the Court of Criminal Appeals (Ala.) for determination of whether the State's reason for striking a juror was race neutral within the rules of Batson, the court considered the other issues raised in defendant's petition for writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was also convicted of four counts of forgery in the second degree, in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-9-3 (1975) and sentenced to four consecutive 15-year terms for the forgery convictions. On direct appeal, the court of criminal appeals affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences. The court granted certiorari review and remanded the cause for determination of the Batson issue. On the trial court's return to the remand, the court of criminal appeals again affirmed, holding that the reasons articulated by the State for striking the potential juror were race-neutral and that the trial court had properly denied defendant's Batson claim. After resolution of the Batson issue, the court considered the other issues raised in defendant's certiorari petition, which were the same issues raised in the court of criminal appeals. The court affirmed the convictions and sentences, reasoning that (1) the court of criminal appeals thoroughly treated each of the issues raised in the petition; and (2) the record disclosed no plain error, which was so obvious that the failure to notice it would seriously affect the fairness or integrity of the judicial proceedings.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that (1) the company did not present substantial evidence that the child possessed the discretion, intelligence, and sensitivity to danger of an ordinary child of 14 years in order to overcome the presumption that the child was incapable of assuming the risk or contributory negligence; (2) the company presented no substantial evidence that the child's actions as a passenger in the automobile involved base, vile, or depraved conduct, thus precluding the bringing a cause of action pursuant to the rule that a person cannot maintain a cause of action if, in order to establish it, he must rely on an illegal or immoral act or transaction to which he was a party; and (3) the record contained ample evidence to support a jury determination that the company's acts or omissions at issue constituted wanton behavior.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was formed for the purpose of obtaining operator's licenses to conduct horse racing and greyhound racing. The corporation argued that the racing commission's award of a license to the county racing association was invalid and sought an order that the license was to be revoked. The circuit court entered judgment in favor of the racing commission and the county racing association, and on appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and adopted the circuit court opinion in its entirety. The court rejected the corporation's argument that state legislation created a controlled selection process for the granting of the licenses in violation of art. I, &sect; 22. Furthermore, the racing commission did not make an arbitrary or capricious decision when it decided not consider the application of the corporation that was filed after the deadline and after the license had been awarded to the county racing association. Additionally, art. I, &sect;22 providing that no law making any exclusive grants of special privileges shall be passed by the legislature was not applicable because the racing commission was a public corporation and not a government entity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband, as administrator of his wife's estate, brought a wrongful death action against appellees, physician and his professional association (physician). The husband appealed the judgment from the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama), which reduced the jury's punitive damages award pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-547. The physician cross-appealed the judgment, contending that the verdict on which it was based was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician passed an endotracheal tube into the wife's stomach instead of her lungs, thus depriving her of oxygen and causing her death. The court agreed with the husband that &sect; 6-5-547 was unconstitutional, and it held that &sect; 6-5-547 violated the equal protection guarantee and the right to a jury trial as guaranteed by the Alabama Constitution. The court concluded that the connection between the benefit sought to be conferred on society and the means employed to accomplish it, when weighed against the inequalities created by the statute's classifications, was so attenuated and remote as to constitute an unreasonable exercise of police power. The court also agreed with the physician's contention that the verdict was excessive. Although the court found that the harm threatened by the physician's conduct weighed in favor of substantial punitive damages, it concluded that other countervailing factors weighed in favor of reducing the verdict. The countervailing factors included the fact that the physician did not attempt to cover-up the mistake and the fact that the execution of a judgment on the full amount of the award would impose a crushing burden on the physician's practice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment to the extent that it applied the damages limitation contained in the statute. The court affirmed the punitive damages verdict in favor of the husband, conditioned upon his acceptance of a remittitur.</SPAN></P>

The bill affected wildlife in only one specific area that created the question of whether it was a local law. The determination of the category under which the bill fell would determine whether it was constitutional. The court determined that the state had the power to enact laws and regulations that were necessary for the protection of the public's right in game. The court found that wildlife belonged to the state and private ownership thereof was a privilege, not a right. The job of the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources was to protect wildlife. The court found that the bill set forth a general law. Though the court recognized that the legislature, in exercising its powers to protect, conserve, and increase the wildlife of the state and to administer all laws relating to wildlife and the protection, conservation, and increase thereof, elected to do so by designating certain impounded waters and not including all, the court found that the classification was prohibited by Ala.

Acts 93-927 (the Act), which modified rules controlling participation in the county employees' general retirement system. The actions were consolidated on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association's suit challenged the constitutionality of the Act and sought to prohibit the board from implementing it. The deputies intervened and filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel implementation. The cases were consolidated and the trial court declared that the Act was void because it violated Ala. Const. &sect;&sect; 45, 106, and the Fourteenth Amendment. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that Ala. Const. &sect; 106 required the publication notice for a local law to include an intelligible abstract or synopsis of the Act's material and substantial elements, but not the details of the proposed law. The most important parts of the Act allowed classified employees, who were not members of the system, to rejoin at any time before retirement and to convert &quot;unpaid service&quot; to &quot;paid service.&quot; After comparing the notice's text, the Act's text, and a prior law that prohibited rejoining, the court found that the notice failed to provide an intelligible abstract or synopsis of at least two substantial material provisions of the Act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant electric cooperatives appealed a judgment of the Cherokee Circuit Court (Alabama) entered in favor of plaintiff municipalities in the municipalities' actions seeking a declaration that the municipal business privilege taxes assessed by the municipalities on the cooperatives were valid and that the cooperatives were not exempt from taxation under the Tennessee Valley Authority Act, 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 831.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cooperatives all distributed power obtained from the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to residents in the municipalities. The municipalities had collected business privilege taxes for over 50 years from the municipalities. When a federal district court ruled that the municipalities were exempt from taxation under the Tennessee Valley Authority Act (Act), the cooperatives advised the municipalities that they were not going to pay the business privilege taxes. The municipalities filed an action seeking declaratory relief validating the taxes. The trial court granted a judgment in favor of the municipalities, holding that the cooperatives were not &quot;franchises&quot; of the TVA and therefore were not immune from taxation under 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 831. The court affirmed, holding that the business privilege taxes were valid. The court also held that the term &quot;franchises&quot; under the Act meant those franchises granted to the TVA by the federal government, not franchises in the more modern sense of &quot;distributorships&quot; such as the cooperatives. The cooperatives were not exempt from state and local taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bill was introduced to honor the state's commitment to an automobile company for its decision to locate its facility in the state in exchange for state financing funds. The justices concluded, however, that the bill violated at least two provisions of the constitution. First, the appropriation that would have been made by &sect; 11 of the bill violated Ala. Const. amend. 450, &sect; 5(a) because the legislature was bound by the constitution to appropriate those funds only as permitted by express provisions of the constitution. The legislature could not avoid constitutional restrictions on its authority to appropriate state funds by diverting such funds from the general fund before they were received by the general fund. The provision required that upon receipt by the fund, such investment income be paid directly to the general fund. Further, Ala. Const. &sect; 213, art. XI did not permit a new debt without a new source of revenue to retire that debt. There existed no law that created a public authority and authorized it to incur debt that was to be paid from the general fund of the state. Therefore, the justices concluded that the bill violated Ala. Const. &sect;&sect; 213 and 5(a).</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants, and the court affirmed. The court concluded that: (1) the alcohol control board provided the affected parties with notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the enactment of the regulation; (2) a license to sell alcoholic beverages was not a property right, but was a privilege granted by the state; (3) the regulation was not overly broad considering the need to keep drunk drivers off the state's highways; and (4) the Equal Protection Clause only required that the regulation pass the rational basis test because there was no suspect class or fundamental right invoked when the statute treated licensees differently from the way the alcohol control board stores were treated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, persons who sought election as deputy circuit clerks, under Ala. Code &sect; 17-2-8 (1975) appealed a judgment by the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) in favor of plaintiffs, circuit court clerks, in an action for a declaratory judgment averring that it was unlawful for individual defendants to seek to fill the office of elected deputy circuit clerk.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs contended that &sect; 17-2-8 was repealed, that &sect; 17-2-8 was never intended to provide for the existence of the elected deputy circuit clerks offices sought, and that Ala. Code &sect; 12-17-93 (1975) specifically empowered them to select and appoint persons for the deputy circuit clerk positions. The trial court held that Ala. Code &sect; 17-2-8 had been repealed by implication. Defendants contended that the trial court erred in ruling that &sect; 17-2-8- had been repealed and contended that &sect; 17-2-8 had statewide applicability. The court held Ala. Code tit. 13, &sect; 199 (1940), was a local law applicable only to provide the Bessemer Division in Alabama with an elected deputy circuit clerk. Thus the provision of Ala. Code &sect; 421 (1940) that was recodified in the 1940 code and recodified at Ala. Code &sect; 17-2-8 (1975), was applicable only to the Bessemer Division. Thus the court concluded that that the trial court's reasoning that the two provisions were irreconcilable as to applicability was wrong. However, the court held that the conclusion that Ala. Code tit. 13, &sect; 199 (1940) repealed the provision over into the 1940 Code from Ala. Code &sect; 421 (1923) was erroneous, but it was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several groups brought class action lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of Alabama's system of public elementary and secondary education, which they contended did not offer equitable and adequate opportunities to the schoolchildren of the state, including children with disabilities. The class actions were consolidated and divided into a liability phase and a remedy phase. The trial court found that the system of public schools violated the statutory and constitutional rights of schoolchildren, and it ordered various state officers to establish and maintain a public school system that provided adequate and equitable opportunities for all children. Two days before a fairness hearing set to assess the reasonableness of a remedy plan, the intervenors sought to intervene as of right, and the trial court denied their motions. The court held that they were entitled to intervene in the remedy phase as a matter of right because of the unique nature of the litigation and the fact that the intervenors purported to represent individuals that were not already represented.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the jurors were impartial prospective jurors who would not have automatically voted for the death penalty in every case, and the trial court did not err in refusing to strike them for cause on that basis. The court held that defendant failed to object during trial to the prosecutor's statements regarding the meaning of &quot;reasonable doubt,&quot; and also failed to sufficiently object to the trial judge's jury instruction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, City of Montgomery and city council (city), sought review of an order of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which permanently enjoined the city from applying 1993 Ala. Acts 93-704 (Act), which allowed Class 3 municipalities to increase the number of members serving on a &quot;municipal board, committee, or like body,&quot; to certain public corporations, including appellee water and sewer board (board).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board filed an action against the city seeking a declaration that the Act did not apply to the board and an injunction prohibiting the city from appointing additional members to the board's board of directors.

The court held that (1) the trial court erred in declaring that the Act did not apply to the board and that the Act would have been unconstitutional if it applied to the board; (2) the Act applied to any instrumentality by which the city performed its governmental functions, including the board, regardless of the fact that the board was a public corporation; and (3) although the Act did not refer to a municipal public corporation, the title of the Act gave proper notice of the requirements of the Act, which did not unconstitutionally amend Ala.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers filed a declaratory judgment action against defendant county, seeking to have 1967 Ala. Acts 406 and Jefferson County, Ala., Ordinance 1120 (1987) declared unconstitutional. The Jefferson County Circuit Court (Alabama) denied the county's motion for summary judgment with regard to the taxpayers' federal constitutional claims, and the county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The act and the ordinance levied a county occupational tax on all eligible income earned in the county, exempting persons who paid the state business license tax and domestic servants employed in private homes. The taxpayers alleged that the exemptions were arbitrary and irrational, in violation of equal protection and due process principles. The county argued that the federal and state constitutional claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The court agreed with the county because the same cause of action was presented in a previous declaratory judgment action. Although the courts in the previous action decided the case on state constitutional grounds, the federal equal protection and due process claims were pleaded. Thus, the claims at least could have been adjudicated and arguably were adjudicated because relief was denied. In addition, there was substantial identity of the parties because the taxpayers in the previous action adequately represented the interests of the taxpayers in the action, and the respective taxpayers' interests were essentially identical.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the denial of the county's motion for summary judgment and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 25-5-11(b), (c)(2) (1975). The Colbert Circuit Court (Alabama) granted the co-employees' motion for summary judgment and the employee and his wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was using a grinder to sharpen an iron pin for a hinge. The grinder that the employee was using had a tolerance between 1/2 inch and 1 inch, instead of the 1/8 inch required by safety guidelines; the discrepancy could have been remedied by an adjustment of the tool rest. While attempting to grind the pin, the employee's thumb was severed. The court reversed the order granting the co-employees' motion for summary judgment. The tool rest on the grinder constituted a safety device under &sect; 25-5-11(c)(2) because one of its main functions was to provide safety to the worker. The employee and his wife stated a cause of action against the co-employees for failure to maintain a safety device because all of the co-employees were in positions of safety responsibility. Substantial evidence established that there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the co-employees should have known that the employee's injury was substantially certain to follow from a failure to repair the grinder. A reasonable jury could have concluded that but for the co-employees' failure to maintain the tool rest and grinder, the employee would not have been injured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting the co-employees' motion for summary judgment was reversed and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney had represented plaintiffs in a prior action involving the constitutionality of a local act effecting plaintiffs' compensation. Following an adverse decision and appeal, plaintiffs obtained new counsel, refiled their action, and effected a settlement that included attorney's fee. The trial court entered an interlocutory order to withhold the fee pending a hearing to determine the propriety of the attorney's claim that the attorney's fee was a common fund from which he was entitled to have been paid for his work in the prior litigation. The trial court found that the attorney was not entitled to the fee. The court affirmed the judgment, adopting the opinion of the trial court that the attorney had not prevailed in the prior litigation and that his theory in the prior action was antagonistic to the theory by which plaintiffs prevailed under the settlement agreement. No common fund from which a separate award of attorney's fee existed even if such an award were merited. Moreover, there was no basis for interfering in the contractual relationships between plaintiffs and their counsel concerning payment of an agreed attorney's fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant director of a state Legislative Reference Service (LRS) challenged a trial court judgment holding that the director could not refuse to supply a copy of a proposed bill to appellee legislator or to any affected citizen after public notice had been published. The director argued that the LRS had an attorney-client relationship with legislators and that release of the bill's details would violate the privilege. The legislator sought a copy of the proposed bill after two legal notices were published informing the public that another legislator intended to introduce the bills in the next legislative session. The director argued that interested parties could not get additional information about the proposed law until the bills were introduced in the legislature. The appellate court disagreed with the director's right-to-confidentiality argument and affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The appellate court held that a legislator waived any confidentiality regarding proposed legislation once public notice was published. The appellate court held that the public notice need not give all the details of the bill, but must merely state the substance of the bill.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower court was affirmed because the attorney-client privilege did not cover statements that were intended to be communicated to third persons.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sales representatives sought damages against defendant company for breach of contract, fraud, and suppression in failing to pay sales commissions owed to them. The Circuit Court of Montgomery County (Alabama) entered judgment upon a jury verdict in favor of the sales representatives after ordering a remittitur on the award for punitive damages. The company appealed and the sales representatives cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that the sales representatives failed to present sufficient evidence and that the trial court should have deducted more on the damages award. The court held that the company was not entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial because the sales representatives presented sufficient evidence on the amount of commissions they were entitled to recover from which the jury could have calculated an award for damages. There was also sufficient evidence presented on the fraudulent suppression claim for the jury to have inferred that the company anticipated that the sales representatives would not accept its offer of employment and that it had taken steps to defraud them of their commissions. The company was entitled to a remittitur on the award for mental anguish because part of the testimony from the sales representatives related to their distress at losing their jobs rather than to any humiliating conduct by the company. The court let stand the trial court's remittitur on punitive damages because the trial court had observed the entire proceedings and the culpability of the company's conduct supported a substantial punitive damages verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, conditioned upon the acceptance of a remittitur by the sales representatives of the mental anguish damages award.

The employee brought the action under the third-party provision of the Workers' Compensation Act, Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-11 (1975), in connection with an on-the-job accident.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee alleged that the plant manager, a coemployee, had failed to install a safety guard on the rotating shaft on a machine and that his failure to do so had resulted in the employee's injuries. The employee also alleged that the insurer, the workers' compensation insurance carrier, in performing safety inspections had negligently or wantonly failed to discover the unguarded rotating shaft. The court rejected the employee's claims and affirmed the decision entered by the trial court in favor of the plant manager and the insurer. The court held that the employee failed to present substantial evidence that a safety guard was &quot;available&quot; and that he was injured as a result of a willful and intentional failure on the part of the plant manager to install an available safety guard. The court further found that the employee made no allegation that the insurer had &quot;willfully&quot; failed to discover the unguarded shaft. Consequently, the court held that the trial court correctly entered a summary judgment for the insurer, noting that &sect; 25-5-11 permitted a recovery against a workers' compensation carrier only for willful conduct.</SPAN></P>

Acts 1992 did not violate any one of three constitutional restraints on the legislature's power contained in Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 104(5), 104(18), 105.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act by its exact words &quot;altered or rearranged&quot; the boundary lines of the a town to include two separate parcels that were not contiguous to the town. Thereafter, the town filed a complaint alleging that the Act was unconstitutional and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The circuit court held that the Act did not violate any provision of the Alabama Constitution. The court affirmed and held that the Act did not violate Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 104(5). A boundary change was not an amendment to the town's charter. Further, Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 104(18) prohibited only changes in the substantive powers of a city by local law. Therefore, even if the proviso of &sect; 104(18) did not exist, local annexation laws changing or rearranging a city's boundaries did not violate &sect; 104. The proviso of &sect; 104(18) expressly preserved the power of the legislature to alter or rearrange a municipality's boundary as it saw fit. No provision of the Alabama Constitution limited the legislature's broad authority with respect to municipalities and their boundaries so as to prevent the legislature from adopting a local act annexing noncontiguous territory to a municipality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's holding that the Act was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the owner died intestate, her husband received letters of administration on the estate and sold the property to the buyer. When the circuit court said that the husband only held a life estate and awarded title to the property to the brother and the sister, all parties appealed. Reversing, the court said that the judgment was grounded principally in a construction of 1981 Ala. Acts 81-1170, a retroactivity provision. That was an erroneous basis on which to enter the judgment. The husband held the property in fee simple from the date of the owner's death. He held both a life estate and a remainder interest. A life estate came into existence only if there were surviving children, to whom the property would have descended under Ala. Code &sect; 43-3-1(1) (amended 1981). The circuit court did not have to reach the question of the constitutionality of the retroactivity provision. Under &sect;&sect; 43-3-1, 43-3-10, the sister and the brother never had an interest in the property that could have been divested from them by the passage of 1981 Ala. Acts 81-1170.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was granted a writ of certiorari to decide the question of whether a prima facie case of discrimination could have been made of the state's use of peremptory challenges to strike black jurors from the venire when the result was that a greater percentage of blacks ultimately sat on the jury than on the venire. The court held that the fact that the jury ultimately contained a higher percentage of blacks than those that sat on the venire did not preclude a prima facie case of discrimination against black jurors. The court noted that the trial court, after the state used peremptory challenges to remove black veniremembers, should have held a Batson inquiry to afford appellant the opportunity to present a prima facie case of discrimination. The court held that the trial court did not deprive appellant of the opportunity to make a prima facie case, but found that appellant failed to make a prima facie case of discriminatory strikes.

The insurer claimed that it should have been granted a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and that the jury's award was excessive. The court affirmed on the condition that a remittitur of the damages of $ 2 million be issued. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the insured's claim that the insurer suppressed the fact that she was due a refund of the premiums she paid after the automatic termination.

The employee argued that the state college breached its contract, that he had a property interest in the position he contracted for, and was denied due process in being transferred without notice or an opportunity to be heard. The court affirmed, holding that the employee's breach of contract claim and his &sect; 1983 claim were barred by state immunity from suit under Ala. Const. art. 1, &sect; 14. Nor did the employee's action fall within the &quot;legal duty&quot; exception to state immunity because an action against state officers or employees in their official capacity that directly affects a contract or property right of the state is prohibited by &sect; 14. Since the contract was an offer of employment by the state college the action was one to compel the state to perform, and thus it was barred by immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the employee's actions against the state college for breach of contract and under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The solid waste management company proposed to construct a privately owned and operated landfill in the county that would be allowed to accept sanitary solid waste.

Public meetings were held, and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management eventually approved an agreement between the county solid waste disposal authority and the company. The court, in reversing the trial court's denial of injunctive relief to the county residents, held that the county commission and the solid waste disposal authority had improperly granted the company an exclusive franchise without competitive bidding as required by Ala. Code &sect; 41-16-51(a) (1975). Because the county commission's grant of local approval was based on a void contract, the grant of local approval was also void.</SPAN></P>

He had rented, but failed to return, a videotape of a movie. The defendant was indigent and could not raise the $ 50 needed to secure a $ 300 bond for his release. The defendant challenged the constitutionality of articles V, VI, VII, and VIII of the Bail Bond Reform Act of 1993, Ala. Code &sect; 15-13-100 et seq. The trial court held the four articles unconstitutional, null and void. The court held that the 72-hour minimum notice requirement of article VII violated indigent defendants' constitutional rights by unreasonably restraining their liberty based on their lack of wealth. The court found that article VII was overbroad, and violated the defendant's right to due process, and equal protection. However, the rationale utilized by the trial court was not sufficient to hold articles V, VI, and VIII unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditors obtained a judgment against the debtor, a Florida resident, in Alabama, and filed a garnishment proceeding against the Alabama offices of three national securities firms. The trial court dismissed the garnishment proceeding, stating that the garnishments were not effective as to securities located outside Alabama. Prior to dismissing the proceeding, the trial court ruled that the debtor had fraudulently transferred certain securities to his wife. The debtor appealed the ruling and the creditors appealed the dismissal of the case. The court affirmed the dismissal and deemed the debtor's appeal moot. Assets not within the jurisdiction of a court issuing a garnishment and not capable of being levied on could not be reached by garnishment, and the debtor never had an account with any Alabama office of the securities firms involved. Although the creditors invoked the principle that the locus of a debt was with the debtor, there was no showing that the securities firms owed the debtor anything. Because the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the proceeding, any question concerning the propriety of a transfer of securities was not properly before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teachers, who filed an action against appellees alleging that they were compelled by appellees to perform medical procedures, such as insertion of tubes, changing of colostomy bags, and the like, for their students that were only to be performed by licensed nurses pursuant to the Nursing Practices Act (NPA), Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 34-21-1 through 34-21-63 (1975). The trial court denied the injunctive relief and held that the procedure did not violate the NPA. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case and dismissed the appeal. The court held that the state board of nursing was the entity that was responsible for enforcing the NPA and the court's opinion would not be binding on them because they were not a party to the litigation. Therefore, the court held that the trial court's judgment failed to terminate the uncertainty that the teachers sought to resolve and would likely to have to resolve the issue again. The court concluded that the absence of the board of nursing in the action rendered the controversy non-justiciable, thus the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and its judgment was void.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 36-27-16(e)(1) while working on a one-year contract for a city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After retiring as a state trooper, the claimant contracted with a city to work for one year as an investigator with its drug unit. The ERS administrative staff ruled that the claimant's employment with the city, a participant in the ERS, constituted restoration to &quot;active service&quot; as that term is used in &sect; 36-27-16(e)(1). Therefore, ERS suspended the claimant's retirement benefits. The Board of Control affirmed. However, the trial court held that the Board of Control misinterpreted &sect; 36-27-16(e)(1) and misapplied it to claimant. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case. The court held that, under the plain meaning of &sect; 36-27-16(e)(1), the claimant's benefits were properly suspended when he was restored to active service with the city as a result of its participation in ERS. The &quot;restored-to-active-service&quot; provisions of &sect; 36-27-16(e)(1) did not apply only in circumstances in which a state retirement beneficiary returned to employment and received credit for additional employer contributions toward future retirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a consent order, the sheriff elected not to withdraw his participation from the system. He was elected to another term, which was to begin on January 14th, making him both the current sheriff and the sheriff-elect. He resigned from the last 16 days of his term and asked to discontinue his contributions to the system after December 28th. He filed an application for retirement that was to be effective on February 1st. At midnight on December 28th, he removed his possessions from his office and turned over his duties. On January 14th, he returned his possessions to the office and began serving the new term. On February 1st, the date his retirement was to begin, he was serving the new term. The court held that the sheriff was unable to draw retirement benefits because (1) the 16-day interruption of service did not cause him to be ineligible to participate in the system; (2) the resignation, which created the interruption in service, was insufficient under state law to allow him to draw benefits from the system; and (3) the system's rules did not allow one serving in an elective office not covered by the system to receive benefits while holding that office.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the Alabama wrongful death statute was not unconstitutional because (1) the nonapportionment of punitive damages among multiple defendants bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest - the prevention of homicide, (2) the trial court's failure to inform the jury of a pro tanto settlement of which it had no knowledge was not erroneous as the trial court gave physician all the relief to which he was entitled when it set off the amount of the settlement against his liability, (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing survivor to call as an expert witness a doctor whom physician had briefly consulted, but had not retained for his defense, (4) newly discovered evidence which physician claimed necessitated a new trial would not likely have led to a different verdict as it would have only served to impeach survivor's expert, (5) a remittitur for the punitive damage award was unnecessary because the award did not exceed an amount necessary to punish physician for his actions or to deter him from committing similar future acts.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that defendant's objection was sufficiently particular to apprise the trial court that he questioned the legality of the ordinance.

The court ruled that there was no literal requirement that condemned property be put into use for the general public, only that the purpose of the taking must have passed constitutional scrutiny, and a state's assessment as to what public purposes should have been advanced by the exercise of the taking power was entitled to substantial deference by the courts. The court concluded that the landlocked landowners, whose land was outside the corporate limits of a municipality and was not adjacent or contiguous to any public road or highway, should have had and could acquire a convenient right-of-way not exceeding in width 30 feet, over the lands intervening and lying between such tract or body of land and the public road nearest or most convenient thereto.</SPAN></P>

The insurer cross-appealed from the denial of its motion for new trial or remittitur of the jury's award of compensatory damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured filed suit, alleging fraud in connection with the sale of a Medicare supplemental policy that was invalid because the insured was covered by Medicaid, not Medicare. The jury returned a verdict for the insured, assessing compensatory and punitive damages. The trial court denied the insured's new trial motion, but reduced the punitive damages award on the basis of Ala Code &sect; 6-11-21, which set a cap on punitive damages. On review, the court held that the trial court properly directed a verdict on the issue of whether the fraud claim was barred by the statute of limitations. However, the court set aside the award of punitive damages and reinstated the jury verdict because, during the pendency of the appeal, the court had held that &sect; 6-11-21 was unconstitutional because it violated the right to a jury trial under the state constitution. Also, the court found that the compensatory damages award was excessive. Thus, the court affirmed the judgment awarding compensatory damages, conditioned upon the insured's acceptance of a remittitur. If the insured did not file a remittitur, then the judgment was to be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The failure to file such a remittitur was to result in a reversal of the judgment and a remand for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment did not prohibit legislation merely because it was special or limited in its application to a particular geographical or political subdivision of the state. Further, the court held that the Equal Protection Clause was offended only if a statute's classification rested on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the state's objective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants initiated a case against the state legislature under federal law, challenging the way district lines were drawn. Appellants also initiated a separate case in state court challenging the existing state legislative district lines under both federal and state law. The state court tentatively approved a consent judgment adopting a plan for redistricting. A certified question was presented to the court concerning the state court's jurisdiction to enter its order adopting the reapportionment plan. The court affirmatively answered the certified question and held that the redistricting issue was justiciable. The court determined that the state court possessed general subject matter jurisdiction to decide all justiciable issues of federal and state constitutional and statutory law. The legislature had the initial responsibility to act in redistricting matters and when the legislature failed to act, the responsibility shifted to the state judiciary. The court concluded that reapportionment was primarily the duty and responsibility of the state through its legislature or other body rather than the federal court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ala. Code &sect; 41-4-90 (1975) provided for a procedure known as &quot;proration,&quot; whereby the governor was authorized to restrict allotments of some appropriations of state government to prevent an overdraft or deficit in any fiscal year. The court held that &sect; 41-4-90 was not unconstitutional on its face as it did not authorize the governor to reduce all legislative appropriations. The court held that &sect; 41-4-90 could not constitutionally apply to reduce appropriations to the judicial branch to such a level that the judiciary was not adequately and reasonably funded to perform the duties of it under federal and state constitutional law. Because the governor attempted to apply proration under &sect; 41-4-90 to the judicial budget without considering whether the remaining appropriations were adequate and reasonable to allow the judiciary to perform its constitutionally mandated duties, the governor's actions were unconstitutional. The legislature subsequently passed an act, providing additional appropriations to the judiciary, which were adequate and reasonable for the completion of the judiciary's constitutionally mandated duties for the year.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment, holding that there was no plain error or defect. In support, the court held that neither defendant objected at trial to the recess and that there was no plain error. The court also found that the jury was fully and adequately charged on both felony murder and accomplice liability. Therefore, the court held that there was no deficiency in the jury instructions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original owner of the gas and coal rights conveyed his interest in coal and coal mining, but reserved his interest in all gas. Coal owners produced coalbed gas by extraction and sought to keep its proceeds. Gas owners asserted claims to the production. The trial court entered judgment for coal owners. The court held that reservation of coalbed methane gas did not include coalbed gas contained within its source coal seam, and that the holder of the coal estate had the right to recover in situ such gas as may be found within the coal seam. However, once that gas escaped unrecovered from the coal and migrated into other strata, then the holder of the gas estate had the right to reduce to possession the coalbed methane gas from the other strata. Thus, if the coal owner captured and sold gasses that had migrated into other strata, the gas owners were entitled to share in any profits on such sales, after taking into account the cost borne by coal owner in capturing and marketing gas.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not err in denying the power company's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial because (1) the power company owed a special duty to children that could form the basis of a cause of action for wantonness, subject to a &quot;heightened knowledge&quot; requirement, (2) the power company had knowledge that children were likely to trespass on the transmission tower, and (3) the evidence, including the power company's modification of the tower, supported the jury's finding that the power company maintained the tower in a condition that posed a high probability of death or serious injury to the area's children. The court found, however, that &sect; 6-2-11, which placed a cap on punitive damages, was unconstitutional because the award of punitive damages was within the jury's discretion and the legislature could not substitute itself for the jury and fix an arbitrary, predetermined limit thereon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a personal injury and wrongful death action brought by plaintiff tort claimants, the Covington Circuit Court (Alabama) jury found defendant city liable but found defendant county was not liable. The city challenged the trial court findings, and the tort claimants challenged the ruling in favor of the county and the trial court's imposition of a damage cap under Ala. Code &sect; 11-93-2 on the award against the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tort claimants brought the current action after they were involved in an automobile accident due to their running a stop sign and being struck by crossing traffic. The tort claimants testified the stop sign was not visible due to overhanging brush, and this was supported by other witnesses. On appeal, the court found the issue of proximate cause was properly left for the jury due to conflicting evidence and that the jury was justified in finding the tort claimants did not see the sign. Similarly, the issue of the county's duty was properly given to the jury where it was unclear whether the county had any control over the intersection at issue. The findings in support of the county and against the city were, therefore, supported. The remaining challenge by the tort claimants was that the reduction of the jury verdict pursuant to &sect; 11-93-2 was improper, as the tort claimants alleged that &sect; 11-93-2 violated the right to jury trial guaranteed by the Alabama Constitution. The court upheld &sect; 11-93-2 and found reasonable limitations on public entity liability appropriate where the judgments against public entities were to be paid out of public moneys derived from taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court ruling in all respects and found that the state statute did not violate the constitutional right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The installation of concrete jetties between the lagoon and the Gulf of Mexico resulted in severe beach erosion. The property owners brought suit against the state highway department and its director, seeking damages and injunctive relief to prevent further erosion. The state attorney general intervened. The parties thereafter entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement, which provided for beachfront improvement work. The trial court ordered the highway department to apply for all necessary permits for the destruction of certain sections of the jetties. The court held that the order did not conflict with the regulatory authority of the United States Corps of Engineers under the Rivers and Harbors Act, 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 403. The court found no basis for setting aside the parties' settlement agreement. An order allowing intervention by other property owners in the area was also deemed proper. Although the intervention occurred after the trial court issued its order regarding permits, the court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's determination that the motion to intervene was timely.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the statute was unconstitutional, finding that there was a rational basis for the law, but that the statute was not rationally related to the basis because defendants could file cross-interrogatories. The court granted the writ. The court held that the statute served a rational relation to protect defendants' U.S. Const. amend. VI right to confront witnesses. The court held that statute's procedure of allowing cross-interrogatories did not satisfy the Confrontation Clause because it did not effectively fulfill the purpose of cross-examination, did not require defendant to be present, and did not allow any type of recross examination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant insurer challenged a jury verdict from the Lowndes Circuit Court (Alabama) in favor of plaintiff insureds on a complaint alleging breach of contract and bad faith based on the insurer's refusal to pay for damage to their motor home after a windstorm. The insureds cross appealed, complaining of the trial court's denial of a directed verdict on their contract claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insureds purchased an insurance policy to cover a mobile home they owned. When the mobile home was damaged, the insurer denied a claim based on an exclusion. The endorsement excluded coverage for windstorm damage to awnings constructed of cloth, vinyl or canvas, and other awnings not permanently attached. The evidence showed the damaged awning was a cloth awning attached to the mobile home by aluminum frames. When the jury in the trial court awarded damages to the insureds on their breach of contract and bad faith complaint, the insurer appealed. The court found the insureds did not meet their burden of showing substantial evidence of the absence of any reasonably legitimate reason for refusal of their claim. The awning was cloth and it was only attached by aluminum frames. Therefore, the trial court erred in submitting the bad faith claim to the jury. However, as to the damage award, the court found the trial court did not err in submitting to the jury the issue of damages for mental anguish. Because the insureds conceded that any error in denying a directed verdict on their contract claim was harmless, the cross appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the insureds on their breach of contract claim and on their mental damages award, but reversed the judgment in their favor on the bad faith claim and instead entered judgment for the insurer on that claim. The insureds' cross appeal was voluntarily dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The litigant was incarcerated in the county jail. A fellow prisoner in the cell stepped on a metal toilet to screw in a light bulb into an overhead fixture. Because the outlet was faulty, the prisoner was electrocuted.

The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the county, sheriff's department, and sheriff. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court held that: (1) Ala.

Senate Bill 607, &sect; 1, which required the legislature to provide schoolchildren with substantially equitable and adequate educational opportunities, was constitutionally required. Senate Bill 607 was introduced in response to an order of the Circuit Court of Montgomery County.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed to answer the legislature's request pursuant to its powers under the Advisory Opinion Act, Ala.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant individuals who had paid the civil jury trial fee sought review of an order of the trial court (Alabama), which denied their request for class certification and found that the statutory $ 50 civil jury trial fee pursuant to Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 12-19-71(4) and 12-19-72(4) did not violate Ala. Const. 1901, &sect; 11 that guaranteed the right to a jury trial or Ala. Const. 1901, &sect; 13, the open court provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals also challenged the portion of the fee paid into the &quot;state general fund&quot; as an unconstitutional tax on the right to have a jury trial. Upon review, the court held that the state legislature could assess a jury trial fee in civil actions because the right to a trial by jury was not a guarantee of the right to litigate without expense. The court found that the state, to run the judicial system, spend over $ 59 million more than the $ 500,000 collected in jury fees. Thus, no portion of the jury trial fees funded anything other than the judiciary, even through a portion of the fee went into the state's general fund. The court concluded that the $ 50 fee was not arbitrary, capricious, or oppressive. The state was required to compensate jurors in civil cases at the rate of $ 10 a day and $ .05 a mile for travel to and from the court under Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 12-19-110 and 12-19-210(a) (1975). Because 24 jurors were required for a juror pool under Ala. R. Civ. P. 47(b), the minimum cost incurred by the state for a jury in a civil trial on the first day was $ 240 plus mileage. Further, the individuals presented no evidence indicating that the amount of the fee was oppressive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate administrator filed a wrongful death action against the doctor. The doctor's insurer rejected the doctor's pre-trial requests that the insurer attempt to negotiate a settlement of the estate administrator's claims, and rejected the estate administrator's attempts to negotiate a settlement. The damage award against the doctor was far in excess of the doctor's coverage with the insurer. The doctor requested a remittitur of the damage award. The circuit court entered a post-trial order that required the insurer to appear and show cause why the circuit court should not have considered the doctor's potential &quot;bad-faith&quot; claims against the insurer when considering the remittitur request. The court reversed the order and remanded. The court held that the circuit court had no authority to order the insurer, a non-party to the action, to appear and assume a burden of proof on the remittitur question. It was within the discretion of the circuit court to ascribe a reasonable present value to the doctor's potential claims, and to consider such an asset on remittitur.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder in regard to the death of victim and was sentenced to death by electrocution. The appellate court affirmed the conviction, and the court granted certiorari review pursuant to Ala. R. App. P. R. 39. Defendant argued that venue was improper in Mobile County, and, therefore, that his conviction must be reversed, and that the statements made by him to the police were not made voluntarily and, therefore, that they were erroneously admitted into evidence. The court held that although defendant was stopped near Jackson, outside Mobile County, in one of his statements, he stated that the murder of the victim occurred in Creola, Alabama, which was in Mobile County. The court further held that defendant initiated contact with the investigator and indicated that he wanted to make a statement, thus, the trial court did not err in admitting the statement. The court concluded that the trial court did not error in sentencing defendant to death because the punishment was not disproportional to the crime pursuant to Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alabama House of Representatives passed a resolution requesting the court's opinion as to the constitutionality of a proposed amendment, imposing an additional &quot;pump tax&quot; on the sellers of motor fuels, the proceeds of which would be distributed to the Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund, Ala. Code &sect; 22-35-1, et seq. (1975). The fund was to be used to investigate and correct underground storage leaks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alabama House of Representatives asked the court to advise them about whether a proposed &quot;pump tax,&quot; if enacted, would be constitutional. H.R. 445 (Ala. 1993) provided that Ala. Code &sect; 40-12-106 (1975) would be amended to impose such a tax on sellers of motor fuels passing through the first pump in the state. The revenue was to be applied to the Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund, established by Ala. Code &sect; 22-35-1, et seq. (1975). The trust fund was used to investigate and correct contamination resulting from underground petroleum storage containers leaks. The court examined the proposed statute in light of Ala. Const. amend. 93, which strictly limited the way in which the legislature could use fuel taxes. The court explained that the emphasis in the proposed statute was not on the pump but on the fuel. Thus, the proposed amendment was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The employee's action was brought pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-11.1, which was a statute included in the amendatory act, 1985 Ala. Acts 85-41. The employer filed a motion for summary judgment and argued that a recent decision held that the attempt in 85-41 to extend the period of limitations violated the prohibition against making amendments to existing legislation by reference to a title. Thus, the employer claimed that the application of the nonseverability clause in 85-41 invalidated the entire amendatory act including Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-11.1. The trial court agreed and granted the employer's motion. The employee appealed, and the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the prior case law declared that the application of the statute was unconstitutional and did not declare the statute itself to be invalid. Thus, the nonseverability clause was not invoked, and it was error to grant the employer's summary judgment motion.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 6-5-391 (1975) and for the wife's pain and discomfort, mental anguish, and emotional distress. The husband and wife appealed from a judgment based on a jury verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician performed a dilatation and curettage on the wife after she was admitted to the hospital and the physician diagnosed an inevitable abortion. An ultrasound the next day showed an apparently normal 11-week fetus. The wife miscarried two weeks later. The court concluded that the fetus was not viable, capable of living outside the womb. The court ruled that the statute did not cover nonviable fetuses, noting that, with the exception of Georgia, that position was apparently the law in any American jurisdiction where there was not clear legislative direction to include a nonviable fetus within the class of those covered by wrongful death acts. The court ruled that the trial court acted within its discretion in excluding rebuttal testimony concerning whether an ultrasound could have been performed before the procedure because the physician admitted that at trial. The court added that the expert witness who would have testified on rebuttal acknowledged that the ultrasound would not have conclusively indicated whether an abortion was in progress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A part-time legislative employee sought the opportunity to purchase retirement credit under 1989 Ala. Acts. 89-800, 89-915. The Board of Control of the state employees' retirement system denied the employee this opportunity and brought an action to declare the legislation unconstitutional. The trial court held that the legislation was not unconstitutional and that the employee should be allowed to purchase the retirement credit. The board appealed. The lower court upheld the constitutionality of the legislation but reversed the judgment allowing the employee to purchase retirement credit on the ground that he had already purchased such credit in a prior year. Both the board and the employee sought further review. On review, the court found that the legislation did not violate principles of equal protection because it furthered a legitimate governmental purpose. The court found no invidious or hostile discrimination inherent in the legislation and held that the board failed to prove unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the employee met all requirements of 1989 Ala. Acts 89-915 and was thus entitled to purchase the retirement credit therein provided.</SPAN></P>

Appellees filed a tort complaint against the companies seeking to recover damages for personal injuries. Appellees amended the complaint to include appellants by alleging that they did not correctly instruct the co-employee in operating the crane, which constituted negligence and wantonness. Appellants filed a motion of Ala. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss on the grounds that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could have been granted. The motion was based on the Act's qualified immunity provisions of Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 25-5-11, 25-5-53 (1975). The court reversed the contested judgment. The court remanded the matter for continued proceedings. The trial court incorrectly failed to dismiss the action against appellants. The trial court incorrectly decided that precedent held that the Act's nonseverability provision required invalidation of &sect; 12 of the Act. The court held that the one year statute of limitations for occupational disease, as contained in Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 25-5-117, 25-5-147, was not extended by the Act. The circuit court incorrectly determined from legislative intent that the statute of limitations was amended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioners brought their separate civil actions in the circuit court. Certain judges transferred their actions to the &quot;equity division&quot; of the circuit court. Petitioners sought writs of mandamus directing the judges to vacate their transfer orders. The court granted the writs because content-based assignment was a practice bearing on the nature of the cases, thus, it was procedural, and could not be dismissed as merely administrative. Further, Ala. R. Civ. P. 83 forbade the use of local court rules to govern procedure. Moreover, no express statutory authorization existed for the transfer of a case from the civil to equity division. Thus, in the absence of statewide authority providing for creation or maintenance of an equity division, as required by the Judicial Article, Ala. Const. art. IV of amend. 328, the content-based equity assignments were impermissible because the assignments perpetuated the improper distinction between law and equity. Finally, mandamus was the proper remedy because the petitioners had a clear legal right to have the transfer orders vacated because the orders were not authorized by law, and the petitioners had no adequate remedy by appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer alleged that the governor violated Ala.

The court rejected the governor's contention that only the governor or the attorney general may bring an action challenging the illegal expenditure of state funds. The court also recognized that tax returns may be qualifiedly privileged, but held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering production of the governor's tax returns. The tax returns were relevant, and the trial court issued a protective order that protected the confidentiality of the tax returns.</SPAN></P>

The original suit alleged negligence but, upon her son's death, a wrongful death claim was added. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the companies that had not yet settled, which the mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">More than two years after the original suit was filed, the trial court ruled that the son's death extinguished the original complaint for negligence, and the sole remedy was under the Wrongful Death Statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-410, which had a two year statute of limitations that had expired because the mother amended the original complaint and did not file a new complaint. The court held that: (1) the old rule that an action for personal injuries that resulted in death was extinguished on a plaintiff's death, and the cases in support were overruled; (2) the meaning of the survival statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-462 (1975), was that all personal claims upon which an action had been filed survived, which was consistent with Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 13; (3) the rule that an entirely new complaint must have been filed in order to recover for wrongful death was no longer the law; (4) &sect; 6-5-410 did not address claims for compensation of personal injuries and &sect; 6-5-462 did not include punitive damages so there was no overlap; and (5) the mother's original complaint was not extinguished and the wrongful death claim was not barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

The dealership argued that punitive damages should not have been awarded without compensatory damages and that testimony from previous customers should not have been admitted. The court affirmed. The buyers sought only punitive damages and the trial court correctly charged the jury that it could not award punitive damages unless it found that the buyers had been &quot;injured&quot; by the dealership's false representation and that the representation had been made knowingly and with the intent to deceive, or recklessly, or wantonly. The trial court properly gave a limiting instruction to the jury both immediately following the testimony of the previous customers and in its oral charge, stating that evidence of similar fraudulent acts was admissible to show a fraudulent intent, plan, or scheme, but that such evidence, standing alone, was not sufficient to establish that the dealership had defrauded the buyers.</SPAN></P>

The trial court then entered its written order granting summary judgment. The clients raised before the court only the issue of the constitutionality of the Alabama Legal Services Liability Act, Ala.

The court held that the clients failed to properly preserve their constitutional issues for review. A constitutional issue had to have been raised at the trial level. The clients failed to mention their constitutional issues at all in the trial court until they filed their supplemental brief which was not filed until after the trial court had held the hearing and taken the motion under submission.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district attorney refused to prosecute for worthless checks without requiring the merchants to execute an affidavit that they had not previously turned the bad checks over to a check collection agency. The merchants brought an action in mandamus to compel the district attorney to prosecute. The trial court held for the district attorney and the court affirmed. The court noted that the criminal law was not designed to enforce the payment of a debt or to adjudicate civil disputes between parties. The court also condemned the use of threat of prosecution as a means of collecting a debt by those who sought only payment of debts and had no interest in criminal prosecution other than as a means of collecting money allegedly due them. The court held that district attorneys, as members of the executive branch of government, had the discretion to refrain from prosecuting whenever they thought that a prosecution would not serve the best interests of the state. The court further held that mandamus would not lie to direct the manner of exercising discretion.</SPAN></P>

The customer also sought review of the application of the punitive damages cap of Ala. Code &sect; 6-11-21 to her award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer was shopping at the store. The employee instructed a cashier not to allow the customer to pay for a pack of cigarettes that she placed on the conveyor belt along with other items. The employee alleged that the customer had placed the cigarettes in her pocket and had attempted to conceal them. When the customer protested, the employee took her by the arm and led her to the back of the store. She was arrested and charged with theft. She was subsequently found not guilty. In the customer's action against the store, the jury returned a general verdict in favor of the customer for compensatory and punitive damages. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the malicious prosecution count should not have been submitted to the jury, as the customer failed to produce substantial evidence of lack of probable cause. The court also found that the assault and battery count was submitted to the jury together with the malicious prosecution count, and because the jury returned a general verdict, it could not presume that the verdict was returned on the good count rather than on the bad count. Thus, the matter was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer sought review of the court's remittur of punitive damages judgment, but the Supreme Court vacated and remanded in light of a newly decided opinion. The court reinstated the verdict and held that the record supported a determination that the insurer's practice, which continued unabated until a claim was made on the policy, of accepting premium payments after the expiration of the grace and courtesy periods constituted a willful misrepresentation that the policy remained in force. The jury could reasonably have concluded that the insurer did not actually regard the policy as lapsed until after the death of the insured. The evidence indicated widespread use of similar conduct and, thus, a high potential for harm similar to that suffered in this case. The frequency of this practice also increased the insurer's potential for &quot;profitability&quot; from it. The court found that no criminal sanctions or civil penalties had been imposed on the insurer for its conduct in this instance as to require mitigation of the punitive damages award and held found that the previous judgment against the insurer had a rational relationship to the legitimate goals of punishment and deterrence.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court held that residents who reside outside the boundaries of the annexed territory did not have a constitutional right to vote, and a compelling state interest did not need to be shown. The annexation was reasonable in furtherance of legitimate municipal objectives such as the admission of community residents who desired to come into the city.

The State used 17 of its 20 peremptory strikes to eliminate 17 of the 19 black veniremembers. The trial court denied defendants' motion to quash the jury panel because the prosecution's explanations were sufficiently race-neutral and the white defendant lacked standing to challenge the exclusion of black veniremembers. The intermediate appeals court found that a defendant had to be a member of the same &quot;cognizable minority&quot; as the excluded juror to challenge the state's peremptory strikes. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the trial court's denial of the motion to quash the jury panel was clearly erroneous because defendants made out a strong prima facie case of racial discrimination, and the state failed to come forward with clear, cogent explanations in rebuttal. The court held that the white defendant had standing under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Alabama Constitution, and state law to challenge the peremptory strikes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county deputies sought review of a judgment from the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama), which declared unconstitutional a local act of the legislature because it materially varied from the bill as advertised in violation of Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 106. Appellees, a county and the county's personnel board, had challenged the act's validity in response to the deputies' action seeking pay raises mandated by the act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deputies filed an action against the county to increase their salaries pursuant to 1982 Ala. Acts 444, known as Local Act No. 82-444, which mandated that the deputies' compensation be equal to that granted to any class of county employees. The trial court agreed with the county's position that the local act, as enacted, materially varied from the bill that was advertised and declared the local act unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 106 required that prior to the introduction of a local bill, the text of the bill had to be published in the affected counties. Under the material variance rule, a law was invalid if a comparison of the law as enacted and the bill as advertised showed material or substantial differences. The court concluded that the advertised bill made no mention of tying the deputies' compensation to that of state troopers or to similar increases given other classes of county employees; it had only referenced the repeal of other acts which dealt with the minimum compensation of deputy sheriffs. The advertisement was not an intelligible abstract or synopsis of the major or substantial parts of the bill.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer laid off the former employees, who filed a class action against the employer. The employer asserted sovereign immunity. The former employees contended that theirs was an action to compel performance of a legal duty and, therefore, not prohibited by sovereign immunity. The trial court granted summary judgment to the employer. The appellate court affirmed. On certiorari, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The class I plaintiffs contended that the union ceased to be their collective bargaining unit when they were terminated and that they were entitled to pension benefits. The collective bargaining agreement provided that pension benefits were payable only to employees who had vested rights in the fund. None of the class I plaintiffs had vested rights in the fund. Accordingly, they failed to prove that the employer had a legal duty to pay them benefits from the pension fund. The class II plaintiffs sought medical insurance benefits. They produced documents and other evidence indicating that they met the contractual requirements. Accordingly, the class II plaintiffs presented a prima facie case that theirs was an action to enforce a legal duty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor argued, inter alia, that a proper analysis of Ala. Const. &sect; 125 (1901) led to the conclusion that he had the authority to exercise a post-adjournment item veto and that when Ala. Const. &sect; 126 (1901), was read in pari materia with Ala. Const. &sect; 125 (1901), the sections provided that he was entitled to approve or disapprove items within appropriations bills at any time during the 10 days following the legislature's sine die adjournment. The court affirmed the trial court's judgments. The court concluded that the only power that &sect; 125 provided the governor after the legislature's final adjournment was to approve bills presented to him within five days of the legislature's final adjournment. The court held that Ala. Const. &sect; 126 (1901) did not authorize the governor to item-veto an appropriations bill after the legislature had adjourned sine die. The court reasoned that, unless the legislature was in session, the legislature could not, pursuant to &sect; 126, (1) receive a message from the governor, (2) have a bill returned to it, (3) consider the governor's objection, or (4) repass the bill over the governor's veto.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient brought a medical malpractice action as the result of complications resulting from an improper injection of a sedative. Because of a statutory cap enacted as part of the Alabama Medical Liability Act of 1987, 1987 Ala. Acts 261, specifically &sect; 6-5-544(b), the trial court reduced the jury verdict for non-economic damages. The court held that the cap was an impermissible burden to the state constitutional right to a jury trial, under Ala. Const. of 1901 art. I, &sect; 11, because the sole reason to set aside a verdict was a determination that the verdict was flawed by bias, prejudice, corruption, or other improper motive. Further, because the cap created a favored class of tortfeasor and balanced the direct burden placed upon catastrophically injured victims of medical malpractice against indirect and speculative benefits of reducing health care costs, it violated the state constitutional right to equal protection, guaranteed by Ala. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 6, and 22.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state department of revenue sought a writ of certiorari to challenge a judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals (Alabama) that refused to determine whether Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-605 was constitutional on the ground that the issue was not raised before the trial court in respondent utilities' action challenging the department's tax assessments under an exemption provided by &sect; 6-5-605.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In six cases, the utilities challenged their tax assessments, contending that the department acknowledged that &sect; 6-5-605 was unconstitutional, that the assessments should have been computed on another basis, and that no interest was due because no tax was due as long as &sect; 6-5-6-5 had not been repealed or declared unconstitutional. In its petition for certiorari, the department contended that the section violated the requirement of Ala. Const. &sect; 45 that statutes contain only one subject and that the subject of a statute was to be clearly expressed in its title. The court reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded the action, holding that the utilities raised the issue and that the trial court declined to address it. Accordingly, the question was properly before the court. The court held that Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-605 was unconstitutional because it violated the one-subject requirement. The statute's title revealed on the surface what was within the body, but did not reveal what, in substance, the statute contained. The court otherwise affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-605 was unconstitutional, reversed the intermediate court judgment as to that issue, and remanded the action. As to all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The officers alleged that the members violated their right to freedom of speech. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) entered a judgment on a jury verdict in favor of the officers. The members appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the town did not deprive the officers of property with due process in relation to their termination and that the trial court erred in submitting that claim to the jury. The court noted that instead of pursuing the town's post-termination procedures, which could have sufficiently provided due process, the officers elected to amend their complaint. The court did not address whether the trial court erred in submitting to the jury the officers' claims of a deprivation of property without due process based on the pay cuts. The court held that the officers' speech in turning in councilmen for improper tire purchases was a matter of public concern. Moreover, the officers' and the public's interest in the free speech involved outweighed any purported state interest in promoting the efficiency of public services. The trial court did not err in submitting the free speech claim to the jury because the officers presented substantial evidence that the speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the challenged employment decisions. The court reversed the judgment and remanded for a new trial as to all claims because the jury returned a general verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A prisoner in the county jail serving a sentence of life without parole, was mistakenly released instead of another prisoner. After being released, the prisoner robbed the victims. The court ruled that summary judgment was proper because, for purposes of the county's vicarious liability, the sheriff was an executive officer and employee of the state, rather than the county, based on Ala. Const. art. V, &sect; 112 (1901). As an executive officer, the sheriff had sovereign immunity under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 because none of the exceptions to such immunity applied in the instant case. Likewise, the deputies had sovereign immunity because the acts of deputies were the acts of the sheriff. Under Alabama law, a deputy was legally an extension of the sheriff. A deputy sheriff was the alter ego of the sheriff. Thus, the court concluded that if the deputies acts were generally considered the acts of the sheriff, it was logical that those acts also enjoyed the immunity covering the sheriff's own acts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision granting summary judgment in favor of defendants in the victims' negligence action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case came before the court on remand from the United States Supreme Court after appellants, insurance company and agent, challenged the court's affirmance of the trial court's decision to remit a portion of the jury's verdict of punitive damages, and to award the remaining portion, in appellee injured party's action for damages for fraud.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury awarded the injured party a substantial sum in punitive damages. The trial court determined that the jury's verdict was excessive and required a remitter, but entered judgment for the remaining amount, which was 499 times that of the compensatory damages award. The insurance company appealed and court affirmed the remitter and the judgment. On further appeal, the United States Supreme Court remanded the case for reconsideration of the affirmance. Upon reconsideration the court affirmed its affirmance of the trial court's remitter. The court found that the trial court conducted a meaningful and adequate review of the jury's award. Further, the court found that the record contained no evidence as to the insurance company and agent's financial positions, other civil or criminal actions, or lack of profitability that would have supported setting aside the trial court's determination. Therefore, the amount of the judgment had a reasonable relation to the reprehensibility of the conduct and the importance of encouraging other insurers to avoid similar conduct.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not clearly abuse its discretion in ordering appellant's expert witness to identify the name of the accountant that had prepared a tax return because mere identification of his accountant would not prejudice a witness. The court stated that it did not overrule its previous ruling that the qualified privilege against disclosure of personal income tax records outweighed the value of those records. The court also held that Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-548(e), which provided that a health care provider could testify as an expert medical witness in an action for damages against another health care provider based on a breach of the standard of care only if he was a similarly situated health care provider was not unconstitutional because it had a proper governmental purpose of establishing a relative standard of care.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 25-5-11(c)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The campus security guard's supervisor told him to use an old station wagon to patrol the campus because the regular patrol car was being repaired. The station wagon had no safety belts, and the driver door would open unless the driver held it shut with his arm through the window. The guard drove the station wagon, rounded a corner, and fell out, injuring his back. He filed a workmen's compensation action under Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-11(c)(2), and defendants successfully sought summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that the terms &quot;safety device&quot; and &quot;safety guard&quot; in &sect; 25-5-11(c)(2) meant a contrivance intended to protect against injury, and that the door and door closure mechanism of the station wagon constituted such a safety device or safety guard because it served to protect the security guard from injury. The court found that defendants' failure to maintain and/or repair the safety guard or device was actionable because it was tantamount to the &quot;removal of&quot; or &quot;failure to install&quot; the safety guard or device.
