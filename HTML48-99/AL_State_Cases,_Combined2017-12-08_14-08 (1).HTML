<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant employer appealed an order of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which found that plaintiff employee had sustained a 31 percent loss of earning capacity and awarded him benefits in a workmen's compensation case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed a complaint against the employer for workmen's compensation benefits, alleging an on-the-job injury. The trial court awarded benefits. On appeal, the employer contended that the employee did not sufficiently rebut the presumption that he had sustained no loss of earning capacity because he returned to the same job, and his post-injury earnings exceeded his pre-injury earnings. Additionally, the employer contended that because the case was pending when the Workers' Compensation Law, found in 1992 Ala. Acts 92-537, went into effect, the standard of review should be in accordance with Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-81(e) (1975) and not with the Workmen's Compensation Law in force at the time of the injury, namely, Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-81(d) (1975) and the case law thereunder. The court concluded that the provisions of Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-81(e) were substantive in nature and that, because the effective date came after the injury, the section could not be applied on appeal. Regarding the earning issues, the court found that the evidence supported the findings and conclusions of the trial court that the employee had rebutted the presumption of earning capacity commensurate with earnings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband sought review of a decision by the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama), which entered an order divorcing the husband and appellee wife, divided their marital assets, and provided for the payment of certain debts and other expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ordered the husband to pay periodic alimony to the wife and to pay a portion of wife's attorney's fees. The wife received, among other things, a one-half interest in the marital residence, an automobile, a certificate of deposit, and three rental homes. The husband received, among other things, a one-half interest in the marital residence, an automobile, a boat, and full interest in his business and its assets. The husband argued that the trial court erred in awarding the wife periodic alimony. He also asserted that the award of attorney's fees to the wife showed favoritism toward her. The court disagreed with the husband and affirmed. Ala. Code &sect; 30-2-51 (1975), governing attorney's fees following divorce, stated that &quot;either spouse&quot; could be granted such an allowance from the &quot;estate of the other spouse.&quot; Thus, there existed no gender-based favoritism resulting in an equal protection violation. Further, the award of an attorney's fee in a divorce case was within the sound discretion of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant dentist challenged the judgment of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which upheld the decision of the Board of Dental Examiners of Alabama (Board) revoking the dentist's dental license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board revoked the dentist's license on the basis that he had violated the Alabama Dental Practice Act (ADPA), specifically Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 34-9-18(a)(2) and -18(a)(6) (1975), which prohibit gross immorality and gross negligence in the practice of dentistry. The trial court upheld the Board's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held, inter alia, that: (1) the dentist was afforded sufficient opportunity to engage in discovery; (2) the dentist was not entitled to access to the investigator's notes and tapes; (3) the Board's amendment of the complaint four days before the hearing did not violate the dentist's right to due process. The court rejected the dentist's contention that the order contained a fatal variance in that it found he had &quot;consensual&quot; sexual relations with an employee and with a 16-year-old patient, but the order then concludes that he &quot;sexually assaulted or abused&quot; the women. The court concluded that the Board could have found that the dentist committed abuse in seducing the patient and a nurse, and that his conduct with other females was not consensual.</SPAN></P>

Acts 79-524.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county argued that the Act that created the Board was unconstitutional because it violated Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 104(14), 105. The trial court granted intervenor employee's motion to intervene as a party defendant and the employee asserted a counterclaim against the county for accumulated sick leave authorized by the Board pursuant to the Act. The court concluded that (1) the Act's delegation of authority to establish salary ranges to law enforcement personnel did not conflict with the budgetary authority of the county commission; (2) local legislation reflecting responses to local needs could be enacted and it was only when those local needs already had been responded to by general legislation that Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 105 prohibited special treatment by local law; and (3) in the absence of a specific statute authorizing or directing the county commission to set and declare classifications of employment, salary ranges, and sick leave benefits, the Act had a sphere of operation separate and apart from that of the general law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following two anonymous calls reporting child abuse, the DHR social worker was denied access. The DHR prevailed in its action against the mother. The mother appealed the order that allowed the DHR access to her home and children. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the lower court. The court reasoned that the legislature did not provide for an order by a court for an investigative entry into a private home on less cause shown than that required for a search warrant. The court held that the words &quot;cause shown&quot; in Ala. Code &sect; 26-14-7(c) (1975), were construed to mean reasonable or probable cause shown, i.e., reasonable or probable cause shown to believe that there was abuse of a child or that a child was then delinquent or dependent. The court pointed out that the petition purporting to present cause shown merely alleged that there had been two reports telephoned in to the DHR by an anonymous person that certain conditions existed or certain events affecting the children had occurred at the home of the mother. The cause shown was unsworn hearsay and could, at best, present a mere suspicion. A mere suspicion was not sufficient to rise to reasonable or probable cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor grated a construction site. Despite efforts to migrate erosion, a considerable amount of sediment flowed from the site into two tributaries of a creek. The Department found that the water contravened state water quality criteria and issued a notice to the contractor requiring it to prevent future migrations of sediment. When the contractor failed to comply with the notice, the Department assessed a civil penalty against the contractor, which included a penalty for each violation occurring in a single day as a result of the discharges. The contractor was also assessed punitive damages. Upon review, the trial court found that the Department was not permitted to assess multiple penalties for a single day or punitive damages. Both parties appealed. The court affirmed the finding that the Department could not assess additional punitive damages. However, the court reversed, holding that the Department could assess multiple penalties for a single day. The court reasoned that the contractor violated &sect; 22-22-9(i)(3) by failing to obtain a permit to discharge the sediment every time discharge from the construction site resulted in new or increased pollution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board and the superintendent entered in to an employment contract whereby the superintendent's term of employment was for five years. The contract also provided for the board's unilateral right to terminate the superintendent. Shortly thereafter, the board unilaterally terminated the superintendent's employment and agreed to pay the superintendent $ 392,066 in severance pay. The taxpayers sought to enjoin the board from making the severance payment. The trial court denied the taxpayers' request for a preliminary and permanent injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that severance pay agreement did not violate Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 68 because the board did not terminate the superintendent for cause but by its unilateral action. Thus, it was within the board's authority to negotiate the terms under which the employment contract could be terminated. Moreover, Ala. Const. art. XVII, &sect; 281 was not violated because the superintendent was not an &quot;officer&quot; as intended by &sect; 281. Finally, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 41-16-51(a)(3) (1975), the maximum three-year employment provision of Ala. Code &sect; 41-16-57(e) (1975) did not apply to superintendents of education.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee had appealed the judgment that found he was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits, and then moved for reconsideration of the court's prior opinion based on the court's failure to address his challenge to the constitutionality of Ala.

The court found that the attorney general had not been served with process to give notice of the proceedings. As the case was challenging the constitutionality of a statute, the attorney general was entitled to be heard and had to be served with notice. As the attorney general was never served, any judgment the trial court could have rendered on the matter would have been void.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against defendant, the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles, in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County (Alabama) seeking an order declaring him eligible for consideration for parole despite the restrictions of Ala. Code &sect; 15-22-27.2 (1975). The circuit court denied declaratory relief, and the inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was serving four concurrent life sentences for robbery committed during the year 1979. He had a prior conviction for rape in 1973. While the Board had considered the inmate for parole in the past, it refused to consider him presently based upon its application of &sect; 15-22-27.2. The inmate alleged that &sect; 15-22-27.2 was unconstitutional as applied to him or, in the alternative, that &sect; 15-22-27.2 did not apply to him. Reversing and remanding, the court noted that Ala. Code &sect; 13A-1-1, et seq. (1975), which became effective January 1, 1980, created the classification of offenses. The inmate's 1973 conviction for rape preceded &sect; 13A-1-1 et seq. Thus, the court held that the inmate correctly asserted that for the Board to base its decision to deny him consideration for parole upon a class of offenses which did not exist at that time violated &sect; 13A-1-1 et seq. Further, penal statutes were to be interpreted strictly against the State and liberally in favor of the accused. Therefore, the inmate was entitled to a declaratory judgment that he was not within the classification of persons defined in Ala. Code &sect; 15-22-27.2 (1975) and should be considered for parole.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded for entry of an order consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment in favor of the class and ordered the refund of taxes paid under the taxation scheme. The commissioner appealed and the court affirmed, holding that the Alabama taxation scheme which favored retired state employees over retired military employees violated the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity because there was no distinction between retired state employees and retired military employees justifying the different tax treatment. The court held that a class action was the proper remedy for the recovery of the income taxes, which were paid pursuant to a void and illegal taxation scheme. The court held that the trial court correctly applied the rule of law retroactively, and that the taxpayers were entitled to refunds.</SPAN></P>

Appellant unnamed class member challenged the attorney fees award as excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State originally allowed taxpayers to deduct from their state income tax the sales tax they had paid, but the State amended the deduction to track the federal income tax deduction at 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 164. The federal tax deduction was abolished. The State then interpreted Ala. Code &sect; 40-18-15(a) (1975) to prevent the deduction for state income tax. The representatives sued. The trial court awarded judgment and attorney fees to the representative. The member intervened and moved to set aside the fee award as excessive, but his motion was denied. The member and the State appealed. The court reversed. The stated purpose of &sect; 40-18-15(a) was to clarify the elimination of the deduction. Section 40-18-15(a) clearly intended to incorporate federal amendments; therefore, &sect; 40-18-15(a) fell within the exception to the reference statute rules. The State's interpretation of &sect; 40-18-15(a) had long stood, and the legislature had failed to change the interpretation during any of the three amendments to the section. The testimony of the department head and the legislative draftsman was irrelevant because it was the intent of the legislature and the individual members or draftsman that governed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case came before the court on an application for rehearing. The Franklin County Circuit Court (Alabama) had awarded a reinstated city employee back pay and benefits in the employee's action against a city to recover back pay for the time that his dismissal from the city police department was in litigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city had appealed the trial court's award, which was increased to include interest and overtime benefits. The employee claimed that 1972 Ala. Acts 465, &sect; 18, which gave a civil service board discretion with disciplinary actions taken against city employees, was violative of his due process rights. The record showed that the trial court might have found the section unconstitutional as applied to the employee and might have entered judgment for the employee based upon the constitutional issue. Dismissing the appeal, the court concluded that the trial court's decree was void. Because the employee raised an issue regarding the constitutionality of a state statute, the state attorney general should have been served with notice according to Ala. Code &sect; 6-6-227 (1975). Service on the attorney general was mandatory and jurisdictional; thus, because the record showed that the attorney general was never served with process, the trial court had no jurisdiction to enter a judgment based on the constitutional issue. The decree was void, and a void decree could not support an appeal to the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff personal injury victim (victim) sought review of a judgment from the Calhoun Circuit Court (Alabama), which granted a motion for a directed verdict in favor of defendants, truck driver and truck lessee, on the victim's claim of wantonness. The victim also sought review of the denial of her motion for a new trial, which was filed on the grounds that the jury's verdict on the victim's negligence claim was inadequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was injured when a rented truck pulled out of a gas station and struck her vehicle. The truck driver had only 2 hours of sleep in the 36 hours prior to the accident. The victim alleged negligent and wanton operation of the vehicle and also alleged that the lessee negligently entrusted the vehicle to the driver. The court affirmed the judgment, rejecting the victim's assertion that the trial court erred when it granted defendants' motion for a directed verdict as to the wantonness claim. The trial court properly withdrew the issue from the jury's consideration because there was no evidence that the driver continued to drive in reckless disregard of premonitory symptoms of sleep. The court also rejected the victim's contention that the jury's damage award was inconsistent with the damages proved. The court found that the uncertainties raised by the evidence presented a factual question for the jury of the degree of the injury and the treatment necessary. Finally, the court held that the trial court did not err in excluding from the jury evidence of the cost of the medical insurance that paid part of the victim's bills because the victim's employer furnished the insurance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that granted defendants' motion for a directed verdict on the victim's claim of wantonness in a personal injury action. The court also affirmed the trial court's denial of a new trial on the victim's negligence claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged the judgment of the Dekalb Circuit Court (Alabama), which ordered that the father continue to pay $ 45 per week in child support for the parties' child who was in college, that he was to pay $ 55 per week for the second child until he reached majority, and that, after the second child reached majority, he was to pay $ 45 per week for that child as long as he remained in college.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the father claimed that the trial court erred in ordering him to contribute toward his sons' college education's in view of evidence that he would not have furnished a college education to his children had the parents remained married. The father further claimed that payments for college would cause him an undue hardship. The court affirmed the order for support while the sons remained in college. The court ruled that evidence was presented from which the trial court could have concluded that the children probably would have had a college education had their parents not divorced. Specifically, the court reasoned that if the parties had not divorced, two incomes instead of one would have been contributing to general household expenses; thus, appellee mother would have had more of her income available to pay for college expenses. Moreover, the court ruled that the oldest son might have been afforded a college education without any added expense to the father if emotional difficulties stemming from the divorce had not caused him to lose a scholarship. Thus, the court ruled that the obligations were not an undue hardship to the father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State Department of Revenue sought review of decisions by the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) in consolidated cases brought by appellee taxpayers to challenge final assessments of gross receipts. One of the taxpayers filed a cross-appeal as to assessments for two years that were upheld against it, and the Department challenged the portion of the trial court's judgment that ordered refunds to both taxpayers for two other years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were telephone toll resale carriers that provided no local exchange service. The trial court found that the Department could not ignore a clear legislative mandate and that money paid to long distance carriers was not revenue &quot;divided with another carrier&quot; under Ala. Code &sect; 40-21-58 (1975). The Department's position was that Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-605 (1975), which exempted long distance services from the gross receipts tax in Ala. Code &sect; 40-21-58 (1975), was unconstitutional. The constitutional issue was not raised in the pleadings, evidence as to the issue was not in the record, and the trial court did not rule on it. On review, the court found that review of the constitutional issue was foreclosed, but that the applicability of the tax under &sect; 40-21-58 was clearly limited by Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-605 (1975) to those providing local exchange services. The taxpayers were, therefore, not responsible for the tax under &sect; 40-21-58 once Ala. Code &sect; 6-505 (1975) passed, but monies paid to long distance carriers and local exchange companies were not revenues &quot;divided with another carrier&quot; for purposes of reducing gross receipts before &sect; 6-505 passed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer and the members of the class were recipients of military or other federal non-civil service retirement or survivor benefits. The taxpayer filed an action against the commissioner requesting a refund of state income taxes paid on the benefits. The taxpayer alleged that Ala. Code &sect; 40-18-19(a)(1), (2) provided a total exemption for individuals who received retirement benefits due to their state employment, but those who worked for the federal government were not given the same treatment. Thus, the taxpayer asserted that the distinction resulted in a discriminatory taxation scheme pursuant to the Public Salary Tax Act, 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111, and in violation of intergovernmental tax immunity. The trial court declared the taxation scheme void and illegal and ordered the commissioner to provide refunds to the taxpayer and the members of the class. The commissioner appealed. The court affirmed, rejecting the commissioner's argument that because military personnel were subject to recall at any time, they were not &quot;retired&quot; like a state government retiree. The court also found that a class action for a tax refund was a proper remedy and that retroactive relief was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court concluded that the Plan's practice of assigning policies with limits in excess of the minimum limits of coverage mandated by the Alabama Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Act, Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 32-7-1 through 32-7-42 (1989), exceeded the Plan's authority and was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the circuit court and remanded the case. The circuit court erred in concluding that the Plan exceeded its authority in requiring limits in excess of the minimum limits mandated by the Act in Ala Code &sect; 32-7-6 (1975). An amendment that allowed the assignment of policies with limits of coverage up to $ 50,000/$ 100,000 was not unconstitutionally in excess of the authority granted by the legislature to the Commissioner to develop an assigned risk plan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a writ of possession issued by the Circuit Court of Mobile County, the sheriff ordered that all goods and property be removed from the home of plaintiffs' parents.

The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the sheriff. The court held that the sheriff was entitled to immunity from the action under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. Because plaintiffs' complaint did not allege that the sheriff acted in bad faith, fraudulently, beyond his authority, or under a mistaken interpretation of the law, or any of the exclusions to the constitutional grant of immunity afforded the sheriff, the sheriff was absolutely immune from liability.</SPAN></P>

The court also ruled that Personnel Board Rule 2 was not overbroad in light of a limiting construction imposed by the Personnel Board and that the employee otherwise lacked standing to claim overbreadth because his rights were not adversely affected by the allegedly overbroad features of Rule 2.

The court ruled that its decision met the first prong of the Chevron test for prospective application of establishing a new rule, that the second prong of the Chevron test was inapplicable, and that retroactive application would impose a severe burden on the State.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee who was previously awarded permanent total disability appealed a trial court order upholding the constitutionality of Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-57(a)(4)b, which allowed an employer, but not its employee, to reopen a workmen's compensation case where the employee's condition improved to the extent he was no longer permanently and totally disabled. The employee argued that the statute, in denying him a right to reopen, constituted a denial of his equal protection rights. The court disagreed, ruling that the statute was constitutional and that the employee's constitutional rights were not violated. While the provision allowed the employer to reopen, but not the employee, the court explained that the employee would have no need or desire to petition a court to reduce his benefits in the event his disability decreased. The court noted, however, that although the statute did not specifically provide that an employee could petition to reopen his case upon a change in his disability subsequent to an award, he had such a right under Ala. R. Civ. P. 59, 60. While he invoked such a right in filing a motion to reopen, the trial court properly determined that the motion needed to be denied.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that all of the grounds presented in the Rule 60(b) motion lacked substantial justification and thereby awarded attorney fees and costs pursuant to the Alabama Litigation Accountability Act, Ala.

In the final Rule 60(b) motion, defendant made certain allegations about a settlement check. The court stated that the trial court did not commit error when it determined that there was no effort on the part of defendant's attorneys to determine the validity of certain claims presented in the Rule 60(b) motions within the meaning of Ala.

The waste contractor instituted an action against the county after the county commission revoked its prior approval of a site for a solid waste disposal facility. The complaint was amended to add a constitutional issue. The state then joined in the proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The waste contractor challenged a portion of Alabama's Solid Waste Disposal Act, Ala. Code &sect; 22-27-1, et seq., (1975) contending that Ala. Code &sect; 22-27-5(b), which authorized local governing bodies to &quot;approve or disapprove disposal sites,&quot; delegated power to local authorities in an unconstitutional manner. The court held that the grant of power to local governing bodies to approve or disapprove sites that presently existed in Ala. Code &sect; 22-27-5(b) was totally devoid of standards to regulate the exercise of that power, and that portion of the Act was unconstitutional. The waste contractor also claimed that the action of the county at the meeting violated procedural due process. There was a total failure of notice to the waste contractor that the commission was to review its prior approval of the waste site at the meeting. The county's license requirements clearly exceeded the proper exercise of its statutory power. In view of the court's holding that the standardless grant of power to local authorities in Ala. Code &sect; 2-2-27-5(b) to approve or disapprove disposal sites was unconstitutional, the county's rescission of its contract with the waste contractor was null and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor, who was in the legal and physical custody of the department, was unable to get consent for an abortion because of the department's policies. At trial, she was denied a waiver of the right to have an abortion under Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 26-21-1 through -8. On appeal, she argued that the inability of the department to give consent effectively placed her in a different class from minors who had parents or guardians who could, at least in theory, give consent to an abortion. She contended that this amounted to disparate treatment under the parental consent statute, violating her constitutional right to equal protection. The court agreed with the minor and reversed and remanded. The court held that requiring the minor to petition for a waiver from consent that she could not possibly obtain unduly burdened her constitutional right to an abortion. She stood in a different position from a minor who could seek consent from parents. The court held that absent parental involvement in the minor's decision to seek an abortion, the statute's legitimate purpose was defeated, making it unconstitutional with respect to children in the minor's situation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother asserted that the evidence was not sufficiently clear and convincing to warrant termination of her parental rights. The court disagreed and upheld the juvenile court's termination ruling. The court was obligated to presume that the juvenile court's judgment was correct and could not alter it on appeal unless it was plainly and palpably wrong. Under Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 26-18-7(a) and -7(b) (1975), it was permissible for the juvenile court to consider such factors as the mother's emotional or mental illness, the failure of the efforts of the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHS) to rehabilitate the mother, and the failure of the mother to adjust her circumstances to meet the children's needs. Further, past history, as well as present circumstances, was properly before the court. Contrary to the mother's contention, it was not necessary for DHS to show that the mother's mental illness was permanent. Rather, a showing that the duration or nature of her mental condition rendered her unable to care for her children was sufficient.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the instructors, who worked for defendant college, and the employees, who worked for defendant school board, appealed from separate judgments from the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama), which ruled in favor of defendants in each of the actions brought by plaintiffs, who alleged that they were dismissed without notice or a hearing in violation of the Fair Dismissal Act. The actions were consolidated on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The college alleged certain charges against the instructors and fired them without a hearing. The instructors brought a declaratory action against the college claiming that they were entitled to their wages pursuant to the Act, until the charges against them were resolved. The trial court ruled in favor of the college finding that because the instructors' three month contract period had expired they were not entitled to the Act's protection. The employees brought an action against the school board after they were dismissed without the Act's notice and hearing requirements. The trial court ruled in favor of the school board finding that the employees did not meet the three consecutive years of service requirement. Both plaintiffs appealed. The appeals were consolidated. On appeal, the court ruled that the instructors were entitled to be paid pursuant to the Act until the charges against them not involving moral turpitude were resolved. Otherwise, the Act's intent would be defeated. However, the court concluded that the employees were not protected under the Act where the Act's language clearly intended to cover only those employees who had met the three-year probationary period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part as to the trial court's judgment, which ruled in favor of the school board. The court reversed and remanded in part as to the trial court's judgment, which ruled in favor of the college, and the court ordered that a decision be rendered consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature created a physical therapy assistant program at the community college in 1987 Ala. Acts 714, which was the Education Appropriation Act. The Commission obtained an injunction preventing the initiation of such a program and declaring that portion of the Act unconstitutional. The trial court determined that the community college had not complied with Ala. Code &sect; 16-5-8 and that the enacting language violated the single subject rule of Ala. Const. &sect;&sect; 45 and 71. The court held that there was sufficient evidence for the trial court to conclude that the community college had not actually submitted its proposals to the Commission, and the Commission had thus not failed to act in order to start the automatic approval provisions. The court held that the Act described only appropriations for public education, and did not indicate its inclusion of the physical therapy assistant program.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department assessed the fuel supplier with additional sales taxes, interest, and penalties. The fuel supplier paid the taxes and appealed the final assessment to the circuit court. The circuit court found that some taxes paid were properly due, and the others were not and should have been refunded. The Department appealed, and the fuel supplier cross-appealed. The court found that sales to vessels in trade or commerce between Alabama ports and ports in other states or foreign countries were exempt from sales tax. The court found that the fuel supplier complied with the duty imposed upon it by the Department when it secured the exemption certificates at the time of the sales transaction, and therefore the fuel supplier was entitled to the sales tax exemption. The court found that the sales to a drilling company for use in a foreign country were exempt from sales tax by reason of the exemption in Ala. Code &sect; 40-23-4(a)(10). The court found that the transportation of offshore supply vessels with crews and supplies to a foreign port for the purpose of employing those vessels in foreign offshore oil fields constituted engaging in &quot;foreign commerce&quot; under &sect; 40-23-4(a)(10).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant father appealed from a decision of the Dale Juvenile Court (Alabama), which overruled the father's motion to dismiss plaintiff mother's action for child support, adjudged the father to be the father of the child, and ordered him to pay child support. The father argued that the statute of limitations contained in the Alabama Uniform Parentage Act (A.U.P.A.), Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 26-17-1 through 26-17-21 (1986 Repl.), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father sought to dismiss the mother's action for child support on the ground that the statute of limitation contained in the A.U.P.A. was unconstitutional. The A.U.P.A. provided for a five-year statute of limitations for paternity actions where a man was presumed to be the father of a child due to his marriage to the child's natural mother. However, there was no statute of limitations for paternity actions where (1) the existence of the father and child relationship was presumed for other reasons, and (2) where a child had no presumed father. The father argued that the statute of limitations violated the equal protection clause because different limitations periods applied to different fathers. The court held that the A.U.P.A.'s statute of limitations were not unconstitutional because they had a reasonable basis and were not arbitrary. The court reasoned that a child covered by the marriage presumption would likely know the identity of his presumed father. However, a child covered under the other two situations was more likely to be unaware of the identity of his father. Thus, the statute of limitations distinction based on the marriage presumption was logical and rational.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The poultry processing plant had filed a petition before the environmental commission to change an administrative rule, regulation, or standard so that it did not have to replace its present sewage treatment plant. The commission had denied the petition, and the matter was remanded to the trial court to consider the poultry processing plant's request for certiorari. The trial court had affirmed the commission's decision. On appeal, the court limited its review to the administrative record for determining whether any legal evidence supported the commission's decision. The court noted from the record that the poultry processing plant's requested changes would have resulted in a massive relaxation of the water quality regulations. Further, the court noted that the practical effect of the petition would have permitted more pollution to be discharged into the two streams, which result would not have promoted the purpose of the Alabama Water Pollution Control Act. The court affirmed the commission's decision to dismiss the petition because it was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While under his care, the doctor subjected a patient to a therapy using certain salves that had no scientific support as to their efficacy and that had known serious potential complications. The salves were mixed in the doctor's kitchen, he was not aware of their precise chemical makeup, and they were supposedly used to &quot;draw out&quot; cancerous tumors of the breast. Instead, they caused severe burns to the patient. The court affirmed and stated that its standard of review was that, if supporting evidence was found in the record, it was bound to affirm the order. Although the doctor objected to the improper use of a deposition, the evidence was such that, even without the deposition, the license revocation was warranted. The granting of a continuance to the Commission to reopen discovery was within the discretion of the hearing officer. Although not extensive, the Commission's order sufficiently stated facts to satisfy the requirements of Ala. Code &sect; 41-22-16(b) (1975, 1982), and the doctor received adequate notice of the hearing. The administrative proceedings were presumptively proper, and that presumption was not overcome by the doctor.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the trial court abused its discretion by denying the minor's request for a waiver, as the evidence presented reflected that she was mature and well-informed enough to make the decision to have the abortion. The testimony indicated that the minor had given considerable thought to both the means and effects of obtaining an abortion as well as her alternatives, either keeping the baby or giving it up for adoption. In addition, the evidence indicated that she came from an unstable family life and, although she was close to her mother, she had not told the mother about the abortion question with her because her stepfather was abusive and it would cause problems for her mother.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court denied the claimant's motion to reopen his workers' compensation claim, the claimant argued on appeal that the trial court erred in denying his motion under Ala.

The claimant also contended that his inability to reopen the suit was a denial of his equal protection rights. The claimant argued that Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-57(a)(4)(b) (1975, 1986 Repl. Vol.) was unconstitutional because it granted the employer the right to reopen workmen's compensation suits but gave no such right to the claimant. The court disagreed, holding that while the statute did not specifically provide such a right, the claimant had the right under Ala. R. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the board raised the rates it charged all users of the new sewage treatment facility, the Department issued a final NPDES permit implementing a more stringent pollution discharge standard. The corporation requested a hearing for the purpose of challenging the final NPDES permit. The Commission dismissed the action and the trial court dismissed the corporation's appeal. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) the Commission's ruling was not appealable because it did not constitute a final order for purposes of Ala. Code &sect; 22-22A-7(c)(6) (1975); (2) the corporation lacked standing to challenge the new NPDES permit on the basis of a constitutional due process violation because the corporation could not show that its injury would have been redressed by a favorable decision; and (3) the corporation lacked statutory standing pursuant to &sect; 22-22A-7(c) to challenge the new permit because it was unable to show that the injury which it sustained was directly inflicted by an administrative action since the corporation's sewage rates increased due to the board's desire to expand the treatment facility rather than the implementation of the new NPDES standard by the Department.</SPAN></P>

The doctor's claim that the financial relationship between the Board, and the Commission created a conflict of interest violative of due process was not supported by the evidence. The court held that because sufficient guidelines were established to serve as benchmarks for the Medical Association of the State of Alabama's board appointments, that appointment power was not constitutionally offensive. Additionally, because Ala. Code &sect; 34-24-53(a) set legislative guidelines for the Board to follow, it was also nonviolative of Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 44.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mayor hired the employee as her personal secretary to work at the federal minimum wage. Her hiring was never approved by the city council, which voided each payroll check issued to the employee who worked 20 weeks without pay. The court stated that the trial court properly held that the mayor had the power to hire the employee without the consent of the city council. Ala. Code &sect; 11-43-81 (1975), in the absence of any contrary statute or other contrary appropriate authority, gave the mayor the authority to hire the employee as her personal secretary without obtaining the consent of the city council. Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 11-43-4 and 11-43-7 (1975), relied upon by the City, did not concern the hiring of administrative personnel by the mayor or the question of who was authorized to hire city employees. Next, the employee was properly awarded attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. Regardless of whether she was hired at will, she had a property interest in her right to be paid for the 20 weeks that she did work, and this interest was protected by the Due Process Clause.

The court reversed the trial court's order and remanded. The court was restricted to an examination of whether the order was reasonable and supported by the evidence. The interest owners had objected to the time frame from which the productivity factor was obtained.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the child's biological and adoptive fathers' parental rights were terminated on grounds of abandonment, the Department took temporary custody due to suspected sexual abuse by the mother. In a retrial after the mother was indicted for sexual abuse, the mother's parental rights were terminated. The court affirmed, holding that the mother's due process rights were not violated by the retrial because they were not terminated based on the unadjudicated sexual abuse charge. The judge considered only that the mother was being held on forgery and theft charges that had been filed after the first trial ended, giving rise to the probability that she faced a lengthy incarceration, even if acquitted of the sexual abuse allegations. Ala. Code &sect; 26-18-7 (1975) permitted the trial court to consider the mother's conviction for any felony as a ground for termination of parental rights. The child lacked supervision and basic necessities and sported serious physical injuries, including burns and fractures. The mother had character disorders that made it difficult for her to be an effective parent. Under Ala. Code &sect;12-15-65(e) (1975), the child was properly declared to be dependent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bonding company challenged a judgment of forfeiture issued by the Houston County Circuit Court (Alabama), which held the company liable on a bond pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 15-22-52(b) (1975). The bonding company claimed that its obligation as surety was discharged when the accused pleaded guilty and was sentenced. The matter was before the court for rehearing sua sponte.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was surety on a continuing bond that recited that it would continue in full until the parties were &quot;duly exonerated.&quot; The court held that, although the accused appeared in court, entered a guilty plea, and was sentenced, he was never surrendered into the custody of the sheriff. Thus, the accused was never &quot;exonerated,&quot; and the bonding company was bound by its obligation until it was discharged by order of the trial court. The trial court, in response to the accused's application for probation, expressly ordered that bond be continued until the probation hearing pursuant to &sect; 15-22-52(b). The court held that the trial court's order was appropriate under &sect; 15-22-52(b). The court rejected the company's argument that &sect; 15-22-52(b) violated the requirements of Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 45. In the court's view, the &quot;one subject&quot; test of Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 45 was satisfied because the provisions of Ala. Code &sect; 15-22-52(b) (1975) that related to the continuance of bond until an application for probation was finally disposed of referred to the subject of the title of the amendment to the original statute, which was &quot;suspension of sentence after conviction.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court further held that there was no reasonable basis for the Board to require the disclaimer in larger Yellow Pages advertisements while not requiring it in smaller ones.

He further testified that the school of education did not offer graduate courses in several core areas designated in Alabama Board of Examiners in Psychology Rule 750-X-2-.03.

The employee was awarded total temporary disability benefits, which he received until his death. His widow filed an action for death benefits.

Code &sect; 25-5-60 only permitted death benefits if the employee died within three years of the injury. The trial court dismissed the action. The widow appealed, and argued that &sect; 25-5-60 violated her due process and equal protection rights. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the statute was reasonable in relation to the goal of compensating injured workers and their families and was adopted in the interest of the community as a whole. Section &sect; 25-5-60 did not contain a presumption that death after three years was from a cause other than the compensable injury; therefore, even if the widow could rebut such a presumption, she would still not be entitled to benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a divorce proceeding, a divorce decree incorporated an agreement of the parties. Subsequently, the husband petitioned, under Ala. Code &sect; 30-2-55 (1975), to modify the part of the agreement incorporated in the decree requiring him to make monthly alimony payments to the wife. The husband asked that the payments be terminated due to the wife's remarriage. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) denied the petition. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The provisions of the divorce decree, which incorporated the parties' agreement concerning alimony, stated that the husband was to pay the wife a monthly sum and that should the wife remarry the monthly alimony would be reduced by a certain amount. The provisions also stated that the agreement concerning the monthly alimony payments was contractual in nature and would not lose its identity with respect to any judgment of divorce. After the wife remarried, the husband petitioned the trial court to terminate the alimony payments pursuant to &sect; 30-2-55. Section 30-2-55 required the termination of periodic alimony upon the remarriage of the party receiving such alimony. The trial court denied the husband's petition. The court affirmed. The court found that (1) there was manifested in the parties' agreement a clear intent that the provisions providing for alimony would not merge into the divorce decree; and (2) consequently the trial court did not have power, under &sect; 30-2-55, to terminate the alimony payments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband filed a petition seeking to have the periodic alimony award terminated on the ground that his wife had lived openly or cohabited with a member of the opposite sex in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 30-2-55 (1975). On appeal of a judgment reducing the award, the court affirmed. Although the evidence was in dispute, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to find that the wife had violated &sect; 30-2-55. The trial court corrected its initial refusal to permit questions on the subject of whether the wife violated &sect; 30-2-55 because of its belief that the provision was unenforceable and possibly unconstitutional, as it did permit the question of whether the wife lived openly or cohabited with her male friend to be fully explored by the parties. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by failing to reduce the wife's alimony in a greater amount. Although the husband's income had been drastically reduced due to the relocation of his medical practice and his incursion of a sizeable amount of indebtedness since the divorce, he had the potential to earn more and also could sell a house that he was permitting relatives to inhabit without paying rent.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the board had the power to promulgate rules and regulations under the Act and thus, violation of those rules and regulations constituted grounds for suspension of the cleaner's certificate.

In affirming, the court concluded that because the taxpayer withdrew its raw materials, ink and newspaper, from inventory for its personal use in printing newspapers, title to the raw materials was not transferred or sold. Rather, the raw materials withdrawn from inventory were used to fulfill the taxpayer's contractual obligation to print ads in its newspaper for its advertising customers and then to distribute those newspapers. The taxpayer sold its advertising space and its ability to circulate ads in its newspapers distributed without costs to readers. As such, the taxpayer's withdrawal and use of inventory to produce newspapers distributed for free was a retail sale triggering sales tax under Ala. Code &sect; 40-23-1(a)(10).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were employers who filed an action against the Alabama Department of Industrial Relations to argue that the term &quot;taxable wage base,&quot; as used in the of Act 83-155 (act), was not the same as, nor did it encompass, the term &quot;benefit wages,&quot; which was used to calculate an employer's tax rate. Thus, the taxpayers argued, the act was unconstitutional because it failed to apprise the affected public that &quot;benefit wages,&quot; upon which the employer's tax contribution rate was computed, would be retroactive, as required Ala. Const. art. 4, &sect; 45. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that, while the term &quot;taxable wage base&quot; had never been specifically defined by statute, its past usage had been consistent. The court held that the term &quot;taxable wage base&quot; referenced the amount of wages set out in Ala. Code &sect; 25-4-16 and upon which the employer's benefit wages were computed. Thus, &quot;taxable wage base&quot; ultimately acted as the basis for the employer's tax contribution rate computation, as provided in Ala. Code &sect; 25-4-54(b)(5).

The court affirmed the lower court's grant of summary judgment to the trustees, concluding that the Act was presumptively constitutional. That was so because the Act was not so vague and indefinite as to violate the constitution beyond a reasonable doubt. On the contrary, the Act imposed a clear burden on the county with respect to paying for services provided to the poor. The Act was also founded on the legislature's duty adequately provide for the poor pursuant to Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 88. Accordingly, the lower court's judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county appealed from a judgment of the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama), which ordered the county to submit a plan for payment of a judgment in plaintiff hospital's mandamus action. The county argued that lack of funds was a defense to the mandamus action, that the county official had no authority to pay the judgment, and that the Alabama Health Care Responsibility Act, under which the hospital obtained the judgment, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital, located in another county, provided medical services to an indigent resident of the county. The Act, at Ala. Code &sect; 22-21-293 (1975), made the county responsible for payment. When the county did not pay, the hospital obtained a judgment against the county in the amount $ 6,693. The hospital sought in this mandamus action to compel payment. The county admitted to having a $ 1,300 surplus that was not specifically budgeted. Therefore, it could not use the lack of funds defense. Where there were some funds available and a judgment against the county, its executive had the authority to pay the judgment, at least to the extent of the funds available. The Act was not unconstitutional. It did not authorize the county to extend credit in violation of the constitution. It merely made it responsible for payment of services provided under the Act. It was consistent with a constitutional directive that counties make adequate provision for maintenance of the poor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The SCPC authorized extending a street in front of the landowners' property to connect with a neighboring subdivision. The landowners filed a petition asking the SCPC to change its plans. The SCPC denied the petition and the trial court upheld the decision. On appeal, the court affirmed. The landowners' argued the SCPC's actions constituted an illegal taking because the street was a cul-de-sac. The court rejected the argument where the evidence showed that the street was not a cul-de-sac in that there was no circle. The court found that the street had been dedicated to the public pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 32-2-51 (1975), and that the SCPC did not have the power to vacate a public street under Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 23-4-1 to -20. The court found that the SCPC's decision had a substantial relation to public health and safety where the connecting road would improve police protection, facilitate utility connection, reduce commuting time, and improve safety. The court rejected the landowners' argument that 1984 Ala. Acts 454, which created the SCPC, was unconstitutional because the landowners did not have standing to assert the claim and the legislature had the power to grant the SCPC authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the widow of an employee injured during the course of his employment, sought review of an order of the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama), which dismissed her complaint for payment of death benefits. In response to the employer's motion to dismiss her claim, the widow alleged that Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-60 (1975), which limited payment of death benefits to deaths occurring within three years of the work related accident, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was totally disabled from a work-related injury. He died 3 years and 43 days after the injury. Because the widow's initial complaint for burial and death benefits did not claim that &sect; 25-5-60 (1975) was unconstitutional, she did not comply with Ala. Code &sect; 6-6-227 (1975), which required persons claiming that statutes were unconstitutional to serve a copy of the complaint on the state's attorney general. She added her constitutional challenge in response to the employer's motion to dismiss but did not notify the attorney general. On appeal, the court held that the failure to notify the attorney general was fatal to her appeal because compliance with the statute, a part of the Alabama Declaratory Judgment Act, Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 6-6-220 to -232 (1975), was mandatory and jurisdictional. The court held that the widow's claim was indistinguishable from an earlier case with analogous facts. There, the state's supreme court held that a motion challenging the constitutionality of a statute came within the Act and because the plaintiff there failed to serve the attorney general as required by state law, the trial court had no jurisdiction to decide the constitutional claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the widow's appeal of the trial court's judgment dismissing her claim for workmen's compensation death benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dentist bought a practice and began billing insurance companies for services not performed. The dentist's assistant informed the seller, who searched the dentist's office while he was away on vacation. The court affirmed the license revocation on appeal, finding first that Ala. Code &sect; 34-9-18(1) (1975) was not unconstitutionally vague or indefinite. The dentist could properly be charged with mistaken misrepresentation, which was long recognized at common law. The court also found that the search by the seller did not constitute a search by the government, even though state agents were later present. Thus, the evidence obtained was properly admitted. In any event, the dentist did not raise this issue at the administrative hearing. The court also found that the Board's decision was properly phrased in terms of the applicable statutes, and that the failure to place a seal on the decision was merely harmless error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Property that had belonged to the decedent was condemned and the condemnation award was granted to the decedent's brother, sisters, and all his heirs and devisees. The illegitimate daughter's claim to the award was denied because she had not been legitimated and was not entitled to inherit from the decedent. The court reversed the trial court's denial of the nephew's request for reimbursement for his payment of the mortgage on the property because (1) he had a remainder interest in the decedent's estate at the time of the decedent's death; (2) he had a right to protect his interest by paying off the balance due under the mortgage and an equitable right to reimbursement from the decedent's estate; and (3) the statute of non-claims did not bar the nephew's claim because no administrator of the decedent's estate was appointed and the equitable right to reimbursement was not within the purview of the statute. The court affirmed the denial of the illegitimate daughter's claim because Alabama's statutory system regarding illegitimate children and intestacy was constitutional and the illegitimate daughter could have taken steps toward legitimation before the decedent's death.</SPAN></P>

Landowner wanted his land annexed, but municipality did not wish to annex landowner's property unless it could also annex fire district's property. Annexation of fire district property, however, automatically triggered a penalty clause set by state law. Municipality and landowner entered into an indemnification agreement, whereby landowner would indemnify municipality for the penalty clause should municipality annex fire district's property. Municipality then annexed landowner's and fire district's property, but failed to pay fire district the set penalty. Fire district sued to recover the penalty, and municipality sued landowner under the indemnification clause. Landowner challenged the State law penalizing governments annexing fire districts as being an unconstitutional statute. That claim failed, and the landowner, who was held liable to the municipality for the penalty, appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the State legislature had the power to create special districts and to take steps to encourage their continued existence. The statute was therefore constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a finding of not guilty based upon the statute of limitations defense that the boyfriend was not the father. The State of Alabama appealed the decision to the circuit court. After hearing testimony, the circuit court entered an order stating that although the court was reasonably satisfied that the boyfriend was the father of the child the action was barred by the five-year statute of limitations. From this finding, the State of Alabama appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that although a two-year statute of limitations was inapplicable due to its being unconstitutional, the State's five-year statute of limitations was not unconstitutional. There was sufficient evidence to conclude that the ex-boyfriend had not admitted paternity via the buying of gifts for the child while he dated the mother.</SPAN></P>

The nonprofits in question had been licensed by a city in Alabama to conduct such games. The State Department of Revenue, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 40-23-2, had required each of the nonprofits to pay a privilege or license tax on bingo gross receipts. The nonprofits' request for a refund of all such taxes collected was denied by the Department. The trial court denied the nonprofits' request for a writ of mandamus requiring the Commissioner of the Department to refund all of the taxes previously collected from them. The court affirmed. Although the nonprofits' entire bingo gross receipts were required to be donated to or used for benevolent purposes, the court found that it did not alter the fact that the profits were derived from the business of conducting or operating a place of amusement or entertainment. Thus, the gross receipts were subject to a tax imposed pursuant to &sect; 40-23-2(2) for the privilege of operating a place of amusement or entertainment.</SPAN></P>

The driver requested an administrative hearing, which was denied. Subsequently, the driver filed a petition in the circuit court seeking declaratory and mandamus relief. The circuit court granted the director's motion to dismiss or in the alternative a motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court found that Alabama law did not afford the opportunity for a hearing prior to the mandatory revocation of a license. The court held that &sect; 32-5A-195 was not unconstitutional because the purpose of the statute was to protect the public, not punish the driver. However, the court also held that the driver could challenge the constitutionality of the statute and could seek review collaterally by mandamus of a judgment of conviction if she alleged that the conviction was invalid or void. Therefore, the court held that the circuit court erred in granting the motion to dismiss or for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department of revenue assessed ad valorem taxes against the company's pipelines and tanks that were located in the state. In an appeal filed by the company, the trial court found that Ala. Code &sect; 40-8-1 was unconstitutional. On further review, the court reversed and held that the statute's classification did not violate the equal protection clause of the state or federal constitutions. The court rejected the argument that the company was not a public utility because it was not subject to the utility gross receipts tax. The court found that the legislature had simply narrowed the class of utilities that were subject to the gross receipts tax. The court determined that the classification of the company as a public utility was not unreasonable because it had the right of eminent domain and it was regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The court rejected the trial court's finding that the state had no rational basis for classifying oil pipeline companies as public utilities for purposes of ad valorem taxation. The court further found that the federal preemption of the tax of airlines, truck lines, and railroads did not preclude the taxation of other utilities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State of Alabama, sought review of a judgment of the Covington County Circuit Court (Alabama), which determined that its paternity action against appellee alleged father was time-barred under Ala. Code &sect; 26-12-7 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that &sect; 26-12-7, which provided a five-year statute of limitations for paternity actions, was unconstitutional because it placed an unfair burden on illegitimate children and deprived them of equal protection of the law. The State urged that was so because legitimate children had the right to seek support from their parents until they reached the age of 19, while illegitimate children were barred from that course after the statute of limitations had run at the end of five years. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 26-12-7 was not unconstitutional. The court could not say that five years did not provide a reasonable opportunity long enough in duration to determine or establish paternity. Further, the five-year limitation was substantially related to the State's interest in avoiding the litigation of stale or fraudulent claims. The legislature was justified in concluding that after five years the lapse of time posed a real threat of loss or diminution of evidence, and an increased vulnerability to fraudulent claims. Moreover, all illegitimate children had an equal opportunity to have the time tolled.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 27-4-4 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The foreign insurers contended that &sect; 27-4-4, which imposed a premium tax on foreign insurers at a rate higher than that imposed on domestic insurers, was unconstitutional. The trial court granted summary judgment to the Commissioner and the domestic insurers. The court stated that in order to survive equal protection analysis, &sect; 27-4-4 had to have a legitimate state purpose, and the legislature's belief that use of the foreign/domestic classification would serve that purpose had to be reasonable. The court affirmed the trial court's finding of at least two legitimate purposes of the tax: encouraging the formation of domestic insurance companies and encouraging capital investment by foreign insurance companies. However, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the issue of the reasonableness of the legislature's belief that the use of the classification would promote those purposes. The presumption of constitutionality afforded legislation was not intended to prevent the full factual development of the challenge of the rationality of the legislature's action. The trial court erred in denying the foreign insurers the opportunity to fully present their evidence at trial.</SPAN></P>

The father argued that the two-year statute of limitations, Ala. Code &sect; 26-12-7 (1975) barred the action and that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was married, but separated when she gave birth to the child on December 24, 1979. She swore out a paternity warrant against the father on January 27, 1982. At the time of the child's birth, the statute of limitations governing paternity prosecutions was two years under Ala. Code &sect; 26-12-7 (1975). Prior to the time the mother filed her action, the statute of limitations was changed to five years under &sect; 26-12-7 (Cum. Supp. 1982). The five-year statute of limitations was effective May 21, 1981. The father argued that the two-year statute controlled and that application of the five-year statute was unconstitutional as applied as an ex post facto legislation. The court disagreed and held that applying the extended statute of limitations did not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws because paternity actions were civil under the applicable laws. The father was not entitled to a new trial because he failed to prove that the evidence could not have been discovered before the trial by the exercise of due diligence.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 30-2-55 (1975), and which ordered the husband to pay alimony for the month prior to the remarriage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties' divorce decree incorporated an agreement that the former husband pay $ 850 in monthly alimony until the former wife's remarriage, which would reduce the payment by half and eliminate it one year later. The husband agreed to maintain the wife as sole beneficiary on life insurance policies provided by his employer and to give her one-third of his retirement pay. When the husband postponed retirement, the wife agreed to accept $ 700 for monthly alimony. The husband successfully sought the termination of all periodic alimony upon the wife's remarriage. On appeal, the court affirmed by holding that Ala. Code &sect; 30-2-55 constitutionally mandated that the monthly payments were to be terminated upon the remarriage of the receiving spouse although the divorce decree provided that the periodic alimony payments should continue after remarriage. The agreement, as merged into the decree, was subject to the district court's equity and statutory requirements and was no longer of a contractual nature. As support from current earnings, the retirement benefit provision was terminable as periodic alimony. The provision for one insurance policy was alimony in gross and not terminable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow alternatively argued that Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 forbade the abatement of the pending action. On appeal, the court disagreed. First, Alabama's Survival Act, Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-462 (1975), was rendered inapplicable by Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-117, which directed that all claims for worker's compensation were forever barred by death unless the death resulted proximately from the occupational disease in question. Likewise, &sect; 25-5-53 stated that the remedy provided under the Act was exclusive. Finally, precedent directed that neither a widow nor dependent children had a right to succeed to a deceased employee's cause of action for determination of worker's compensation benefits, and the provision extending benefits to survivors of an injured employee who died from unrelated causes was inapplicable because no amount of disability had been determined. Thus, the employee's action abated at his death. Further, Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 did not forbid that abatement because an employee who elected to be bound by the Act necessarily waived rights to any other forms of compensation from an employer. Thus, the abatement provision of the Act controlled, and the action was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers filed an appeal in the circuit court for Etowah County, but failed to file a copy with the department.

The Etowah Circuit Court dismissed the appeal and transferred the declaratory judgment action to the Circuit Court of Montgomery County because of a lack of proper venue.

When the employer failed to pay him the compensation for such missed time as provided under the collective bargaining agreement and the jury pay statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 12-16-8 (1975), the employee initiated an action. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the employee, and the employer sought review contending that the statute was unconstitutional. Pursuant to the jury pay statute, the employer was liable to the employee for the difference in compensation between the jury pay and the employee's regular pay. The court found that the statute was not in violation of the due process clause because, although jury duty was mandatory, it was sporadic and was unlikely to involve many employees at once. The court further determined that the statute was not in violation of the prohibition against impairment of contract obligations because the state had the police power to enact such statute. The court held that the employee was entitled to recover the difference between his full-time pay and that received for jury duty. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

On appeal he contended that his discharge violated due process in that his discharge was not rationally related to any legitimate governmental interest. He raised other constitutional issues that the court would not consider as they were raised for the first time in a brief before the court. The court affirmed the discharge and held that if job performance was the proper test for termination, the test was met in the case. The evidence established that the former employee's job required extensive contact with the public. Some of the character witnesses called by the former employee himself indicated that the incident in which appellant was involved would affect appellant's credibility in his job performance. The foregoing was sufficient to establish a rational connection between the reason for termination and job performance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother took her son to his grandmother's home when he was two years old where he remained. For a reason that was not clear, the grandmother filed a petition of dependency. After two extended oral hearings, the juvenile court found that the best interests of the child would be served by eventual custody with the mother. However, it delayed transferring custody for almost 14 months. The mother appealed, arguing that the juvenile court abused its discretion in delaying transfer of permanent custody. The court held that the primary and first concern in the disposition of a child custody case was the best interest of the child. The determination of that best interest was an exercise of judicial discretion based upon the evidence. Absent a clear abuse of that discretion the court would not disturb the judgment of the juvenile court. The court found that delaying the transfer to allow the son to become re-acquainted with his mother through visitation and to prevent the trauma to him of an abrupt removal from his grandmother was a valid one calculated to serve his best interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding the juvenile court's judgment to be sound, the court affirmed the judgment that delayed custody to the mother of a child who had lived with his grandmother for over three years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An ADC order regulating buttermilk was declared unconstitutional after the distributors had made certain payments to the producers as required by the regulation. The distributors attempted to recover the payments made by offsetting the amount of such payments against current debts that they owed to the producers. The ADC denied the producers relief from the offset; the trial court affirmed the ADC's order. In affirming that ruling, the court reasoned that the general function of the ADC was to regulate the production and marketing of milk under Ala. Code &sect; 2-13-41 (1975). The Alabama Legislature specifically granted to the ADC the power to act as mediator and arbitrator in any controversy related to the fluid milk industry under Ala. Code &sect; 2-13-47(18) (1975). The ADC exercised that power properly in requiring the producers, which had received the benefit of an invalid regulation, to make restitution to the distributors. The payments made to the producers were not and never had been their property. To require the distributors to sue for the return of payments would not promote the efficient administration of justice. The ADC's order was supported by sufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted motions to dismiss to both insurance companies, and transferred the action against the employer to another county. The appeal concerned the dismissal of the direct action against the insurers. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that an employee or his dependents could not have brought an action against the insurer directly for benefits under a policy that specifically authorized such direct action. The court held that a direct action could have been brought against an insurer only under Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-8(f)(4) (1975). The court also rejected the widow's contention that &sect; 25-5-8(f)(4) was unconstitutional, as she failed to show that the statute was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. Lastly, the widow did not have an action based on a third party beneficiary theory because the insurer could not have been liable under the terms of the policy until the employee had established his workmen's compensation claim against the employer.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 20-2-93 (1975) because it was used to transport controlled substances for the purpose of sale. A petition of condemnation was filed against the truck in the circuit court. The court found that notice by publication was given to all claimants, that the bank had actual notice of the seizure and filing of the forfeiture petition and failed to file its claim within the period allowed. The bank challenged the denial of its claim, contending that as the holder of a properly registered security interest, it was entitled to notice of the filing of the forfeiture petition and that constructive service was constitutionally insufficient. Pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-93(a)(4)c, the State proclaimed that forfeiture of a conveyance encumbered by a bona fide security interest was subject to that interest if the secured party neither had knowledge of nor consented to its illegal use. Notice by publication did not reasonably satisfy the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to the forfeiture as the bank's name and address were known or reasonably ascertainable.

The taxpayers deposited the amount of the taxes into the trial court and protested any requirement that amounts in excess of the actual taxes, i.e., penalties and interest, be paid in order to perfect appeal as required under &sect; 40-2-22. Specifically, the taxpayers claimed that the requirements of the statute unconstitutionally deprived them of their property without due process of law.

Appellant, the guardian ad litem for the patient, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, which caused her to react, sometimes violently, towards others. The boarding house operator filed a commitment petition against the patient. The probate court granted the petition. Following the standard set forth in Ala. Code &sect; 22-52-10, the probate court held that from the clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence, the patient posed a real threat of substantial harm to herself and to others, that the danger had been evidenced by overt acts, that there was care and treatment available for the illness diagnosed, that confinement in a hospital was necessary for her safety, and that commitment was the lease restrictive alternative necessary. The guardian ad litem for the patient appealed. On appeal the court affirmed. The court held that the evidence of discernible physical neglect was adequate to warrant a finding of dangerousness to self, and that, due to the patient's mental condition and to the lack of any other viable alternative at the time of the hearing, the probate court had no other real alternative but to order her committed for treatment as well as to provide food and shelter pending such treatment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-husband challenged a judgment of the Winston County Circuit Court (Alabama), which entered an order of divorce between the ex-husband and the ex-wife, which distributed the parties' property, and ordered the ex-husband to pay alimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the order of divorce, the ex-husband argued that the trial court lacked authority to award alimony to the ex-wife and that the imposition of an alimony obligation on the ex-husband constituted a placement of the ex-husband into involuntary servitude. On review, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. In reaching its conclusion, the court first upheld the distribution of the parties' property because, although it was uneven, it was not clearly wrong. The court then acknowl3edged that a U.S. Supreme Court decision had declared state alimony statutes unconstitutional because they did not provide for alimony awards to husbands. However, the court found that, prior to the divorce action at bar, it had declared that state statutes allowed alimony awards to husbands. Thus, the statutes were effective at the time of the divorce and the trial court had authority to award alimony to the ex-wife. The court then held that, despite the severance of the marital relationship, the ex-husband's duties to the ex-wife remained, such that imposing an alimony obligation did not constitute placing the ex-husband into involuntary servitude.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of divorce, the property distribution, and alimony award.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not have the authority to set a supersedeas bond which would supersede the custodial order, and correctly denied the father's request to stay the award of custody to the wife pending appeal. The court held that it failed to find evidence of a material change of circumstances that affected the best interests and welfare of the child to necessitate an obvious and overwhelming necessity for change.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the city had authority to levy a garbage service fee based upon Ala. Code &sect; 11-47-135 and &sect; 22-27-1 through &sect; 22-27-7. It rejected the businessman's contention that the imposition of the garbage fee on owners of apartments and occupants of single family dwellings amounted to a denial of equal protection. The court affirmed. The court found Ala. Code &sect; 11-47-135 authority for the city to levy a fee for garbage collection because it specifically provided that a city had the power to collect and dispose of garbage and to fix and collect reasonable fees therefor. In addition, Ala. Code &sect; 22-27-5(a) provided for a municipality to establish fees for the purpose of administering and operating a solid waste program. In the absence of evidence that the businessman applied for or received a certificate of exception, the court found the fees mandatory. The court determined that the categories of the ordinance were germane to its purpose. The court concluded that the members of each class were treated equally, reasonably, and not oppressively, and that the different classes were based on substantial, valid distinctions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee operated a lounge and held a club liquor license. The Board found that he violated No. 30, &sect; 4 by allowing persons to walk around with drinks, allowing prostitution, and selling beer without Mobile County, Alabama, Revenue Stamps. The court held that the evidence supported the Board's findings of guilt as to the charge of allowing prostitution to occur on the licensed premises and as to the charge of selling beer without Revenue Stamps. However, the revocation of the license could not be based upon a finding of guilt on the charge of allowing persons to walk around with drinks. The alleged incidences of prostitution violated Mobile City, Ala., Code &sect; 41-13.1. Walking around with a drink in hand was not a crime in the State, and a revocation of a license based on a finding of guilt on that charge was without legal foundation. Walking around with a drink in hand was not specifically prohibited in Ala. Code tit. 29, &sect; 44 (1940).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband sought review of a judgment from Geneva Circuit Court (Alabama), which divided the parties' property in granting a divorce in the parties' eight-year marriage. The judgment awarded appellee wife all furniture and fixtures; the parties' mobile home and a meat packing business, subject to a mortgage; and a cash award. The husband was also required to pay the parties' current indebtedness except the mortgage, plus attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband's principal argument on appeal was that the alimony in gross award was excessive and should be set aside. The court noted that the money used to purchase the mobile home owned jointly by the parties came from funds belonging to the wife and that the wife placed in the parties' joint checking account approximately $ 7,500 of her personal funds, and it was from this account that the money came to purchase the lot upon which the meat processing building was constructed. There was no error in giving the wife the mobile home nor in giving her title to the property and assets of the meat processing business subject to her satisfying the $ 20,000 mortgage outstanding on these properties. She was merely receiving that which was hers. The husband was employed and owned 160 acres of land, whereas the wife was unemployed, with no readily available marketable skills, and a mortgage indebtedness of about $ 20,000 which was one month in default. In consideration of the contributions made to the marriage and what she received from it after it was terminated, the court held that the trial court did not err in its award of alimony in gross.</SPAN></P>

The husband appealed to the state supreme court, which originally granted certiorari but then quashed the writ. The husband appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which held that the statute sections were unconstitutional on the ground that they were violative of the equal protection provisions of the United States Constitution. The case was remanded to the court for proceedings consistent with the Court's opinion. Upon remand, the wife filed in the court a motion to affirm the judgment rendered in the circuit court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher had rights of tenure at the college and was notified by letter that, because of decreased enrollment, her contract would not be renewed for the following school year. However, she was offered a part-time teaching position. Six weeks later, the teacher accepted the part-time position with &quot;sadness and protest.&quot; Six weeks thereafter, she resigned and accepted a full-time teaching position with another college. Five months after the termination letter, counsel requested a hearing on her behalf. She was granted a hearing and the non-renewal of her contract was upheld. Affirming summary judgment for the college, the court held that the teacher was not denied due process. A delay of over 150 days in filing a request for a hearing constituted an unreasonable delay and was a waiver of her due process rights, particularly when she accepted non-renewal through acceptance of the proffered part-time position and subsequently resigned from the college in the interim. The college's provision of a hearing upon her request provided her post-termination procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court held a de novo hearing upon the mother's amended petition seeking sole permanent custody and awarded permanent custody of the child to DPS. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the trial court properly applied the best interest of the child standard in determining his custody. It was obvious from the record that the use of less drastic measures than permanent deprivation of custody was tried on many occasions and absolutely no cooperation was obtained from the parents. The dependent child provisions of the Alabama Juvenile Proceedings Statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 12-15-1(10), 12-15-71, were not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.

The court affirmed the judgment. The court determined that the Board's policy of providing additional compensation to those employees who had acquired previous teaching experience and its utilization of the stated criteria in making its determination were reasonably and rationally related to the purposes for which that policy was promulgated. The court stated that the record supported the trial court's conclusion that the teacher had failed to prove arbitrary or discriminatory treatment and that the record contained sufficient evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that the Board's policy did not suffer from the constitutional infirmities suggested by the teacher.</SPAN></P>

In 1976, the wife re-married and the husband sought to terminate the alimony because of the remarriage. The petition was denied. In 1978, Ala. Code &sect; 30-2-55 (1975) became effective and it provided for termination of alimony upon the remarriage of the recipient. Thereafter, the husband petitioned again for termination of his alimony obligations and the petition was denied again. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment. The court noted that the effective date of &sect; 30-2-55 was almost two years after the wife remarried. The court found that the statute did not apply retroactively. The court disregarded several arguments of the parties because it determined that &sect; 30-2-55 had no application to the wife's remarriage. The court stated that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the wife attorney's fees. The court concluded that the trial court properly denied the husband's petition for modification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company held a mortgage to a motel's property. When the mortgage went unpaid, the company obtained a writ of seizure on one of the motel's checking accounts. When the bank presented checks written on that account and deposited in its institution for payment, the checks were returned unpaid because the funds were frozen under the writ of seizure. There were no funds remaining in the motel's account with the bank, and the bank filed an action to recover the funds. The trial court ultimately entered judgment for the bank against the company. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that: 1) the bank had a security interest in the checks, but not in the motel's bank account; 2) the checks were not proceeds of collateral and not disposed of or exchanged in a way to become proceeds; 3) the company's writ of seizure had priority over the bank's demand for payment because it preceded such demand, and was therefore controlling; 4) the bank was not an indispensable party; and 5) the company held legal title to the motel's seized bank account.</SPAN></P>

He asserted that the alimony award was improper because the wife's separate estate was adequate for her maintenance, and that the award of both alimony in gross and a property settlement in the same judgment was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the parties were divorced, the trial court awarded the wife alimony in gross and a property settlement. The husband appealed, asserting that the trial court erred because the wife's separate estate was adequate for her support, and he urged that the trial court improperly awarded alimony in gross and a property settlement in the same decree. The court disagreed and affirmed. It explained that the wife's &quot;separate estate&quot; was that property over which she exercised exclusive control and from which the husband derived no benefit by reason of the marital relationship. A determination of her separate estate was made prior to the divorce decree and excluded her interest in a division of jointly owned property and an award of alimony in gross. Thus, the trial court had not erred in determining that it was necessary to augment her separate estate with support from the husband. The court further held that there was no error in the order for a division of jointly held assets and an award of alimony in gross in the same decree. The parties' jointly owned property was divided equally, and the alimony in gross was not excessive. The court found no indication that the awards were punitive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the divorce action between appellant husband and appellee wife, the husband challenged the judgment entered by the trial court (Alabama), which divided their property and awarded the wife child support. On appeal, the husband assigned error in part to the action of the trial court in recusing himself from the case and in excusing certain witnesses from the courtroom.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that the parties had accumulated substantial assets and that the husband had affairs during the marriage. In considering the husband's appeal, the court determined that there was no abuse of discretion in the division of marital property or the child support award. The amount of child support depended on the facts, and there was no mathematical formula for determining an appropriate award. The same rationale applied to the division of property, which did not have to be equal but had to be related to the nature of the case. The court rejected the husband's contention that the trial court failed to give enough weight to certain evidence. For the court to have done so would have required that it substitute its judgment, which was something the law did not allow. There also was no error in the trial judge's recusal on his own motion because he had a personal friendship with both parties and had personal knowledge of the facts of the case. The court further ruled that excluding witnesses from the courtroom was within the trial court's sole discretion, and the exercise of that discretion, even when it excluded some witnesses but not others, was not reviewable.</SPAN></P>

Although the mother contended that the attorney who was appointed to represent her as guardian ad litem rendered ineffective assistance, the court found otherwise, concluding that the attorney's representation was sufficient to meet the due process guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court declined to consider a constitutional challenge to statutory provisions dealing with child deprivation proceedings because the issue had not been presented to the trial court prior to a motion for new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A father was serving jail time for armed robbery. Subsequently, his child's stepfather filed a petition to adopt the father's child. The trial court found that pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 26-10-3 (1975), the father's consent was not necessary for adoption because he had abandoned the child. This decision was affirmed by the appellate court and the court. A charge of abandonment in adoption cases must generally be supported by evidence of the intentional relinquishment of all parental rights and a disregard of or indifference to the parental obligations owed a child. The court held that intentional criminal misconduct with knowledge that the probable result will be separation from the child and the inability to fulfill parental duties could be considered in determining intent and purpose to abandon. Further, the court found that &sect; 26-10-3 was constitutional in that it required the parent to receive reasonable notice. It is unnecessary for a statute to fulfill every due process requirement where it has been given such construction by the courts.</SPAN></P>

Code tit. 51, &sect; 704 (1940, Recomp. 1958) violated Ala. Const. art. XI, &sect; 217 (1901), and that the case law interpretation of the term &quot;substantial contact&quot; was so vague and indefinite that Ala. Code tit. 51, &sect; 704 was incapable of being enforced. The court held that there was no contradiction in the application of &sect; 704 and the constitutional provision of Ala. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife was a homemaker. The husband was the owner and operator of a Chevrolet dealership. The trial court granted the divorce. The court affirmed. The trial court ordered the husband to pay child support until further orders. The court held that the language merely indicated that the trial court retained jurisdiction to modify the requirement that the husband pay child support. The husband's General Motors stock and his automobile dealership were income producing. The husband testified that his business was improving. The wife had neither the assets nor a separate estate to support her son and herself. The court found no abuse of discretion in the alimony award. Since the trial court had discretion to award attorney's fees, the court found no abuse of discretion. The award was neither excessive nor unjust. Since the husband did not raise the issue of the constitutionality of Ala. Code tit. 30, &sect; 51 (1975) or the joinder of General Motors during the trial, the court did not consider the issues.

This evidence was allowed over the Board's objection. The trial court reversed the Board's decision and the Board sought review. On appeal, the court determined that Ala. Code tit. 46, &sect; 120(30) (1940) did not permit the de novo hearing of an appeal of the Board's decision. The trial court was limited to a review of the record before the Board, and it was therefore error to hear independent evidence. The court also determined that Ala. Code tit. 46, &sect; 120(22) (1940) was not void for vagueness because the term &quot;gross negligence&quot; was not inherently vague.

The issue on appeal was whether the statute of limitations on the negligence for failure to comply with Ala. Code tit. 50, &sect; 16 (1958) began to run after the contract was awarded and before the work was commenced or after the job had been completed, a final settlement had, and actual damages done. The court reversed the judgment against the building supply business and remanded the case. The court determined that the one-year statute of limitations in Ala. Code tit. 7, &sect; 26 (1958) applied to the claim of the building supply business. The court concluded that the trial court erred in holding that the cause of action was barred one year from the time work was commenced. The court found that the building supply business suffered no damage until the materials were furnished and the housing authority made final payment to the contractor.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that issues not raised in the trial court would not be considered for the first time on appeal. The corporation stated that because the constitutional question was raised in both the petition and pretrial order that the court could address the issue. The court disagreed. The record failed to disclose that the constitutionality of the ordinance was challenged in the trial court. The corporation sought review on a different theory than presented to the trial court. The court held that a case would not be reviewed on a theory different from that raised in the trial court. Further, the facts did not constitute matters of public concern, The court held that a presumption of validity attached to a zoning ordinance. The ordinance as applied was not so palpably inadequate and incomplete that it warranted a decision holding it invalid. Clearly scrap metal was kept or stored on the property in question, which activity constituted the operation of a junkyard within the plain terms of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The parents contended that the trial court's decree was not supported by the evidence, and the statute under which the children were found to be neglected or dependent had subsequently been declared unconstitutional. On appeal, the court declined to address the merits of the parents' contentions because the record indicated that the filing of the appeal was not timely filed pursuant to the requirements of Ala. R. App. P. 4(a)(1). Also, the court did not find that the parents' motion to reconsider the trial court's order had tolled the running of the time for filing an appeal. However, the court found that the parents could prosecute an appeal solely with respect to the trial court's ruling on the motion that was filed pursuant to Ala. R. Civ. P. 60(b). The court could not say the trial court's action had fallen within the category of conduct deemed arbitrary, which warranted a reversal as an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant policeman challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Walker County (Alabama), which affirmed a decision of appellee city civil service board to discharge the policeman from employment for his conduct unbecoming to his official position and denied the policeman's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The permanent policeman who was off-duty and out of uniform was observed drinking beer and being intoxicated in a public place in a dry county and in the presence of young people. The police chief discharged the policeman for unbecoming conduct. The policeman appealed his discharge to the civil service board. Over eight months later, the board sustained the discharge and ruled that it was to be retroactive to the police chief's discharge. The circuit court upheld the board's discharge. On appeal, the court affirmed in part the circuit court's affirmation of the board's discharge by concluding that the board's finding that the policeman's public conduct was unbecoming was supported by substantial evidence. As the board found as a fact that the policeman's public drinking and intoxication was conduct unbecoming an off-duty officer, the court was precluded from deciding whether the policeman's conduct was unbecoming. As 1965 Ala. Acts 113, &sect; 14(a) provided that the policeman's permissible discharge by the police chief was final only after a full due process hearing before the board, the policeman was entitled to his pay from the date of the initial discharge to the final discharge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's automobile was seized coincidental with certain marijuana and had been in the possession of the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. A complaint seeking forfeiture of the vehicle pursuant Ala. Code &sect; 258(57) (1940) was filed by the State. On appeal, the court found that the search and seizure of defendant's vehicle fell within an exception to the warrant requirement. The facts constituted &quot;exigent circumstances,&quot; which dispensed with the requirement of procurement of a warrant prior to the search. The predominant interest of the State in protecting the public welfare was sufficient justification to dispense with preseizure notice and hearing under circumstances requiring prompt action. Defendant's dominion over his property was only temporarily postponed pending the prompt initiation of judicial proceedings to determine the propriety of the seizure. The interruption is occasioned by the State's performance of one of its most significant functions; i.e., the enforcement of laws promoting the general welfare of the population. The court did not deem the interruption to constitute an unreasonable deprivation of property forbidden by the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Code tit. 51, &sect; 596(1) (1940), appellant taxpayer, a contractor on a highway project, was assessed a tax by appellee Alabama Department of Revenue. An Alabama trial court sustained the assessment, but ruled that the provisions of the statute exempting contracts made with any city, town, or county discriminated against the federal government. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued that the statute was discriminatory in that only electrical contractors who engaged in highway construction were taxed. The court stated that the privilege taxed was that of engaging in highway construction. As such, the tax fell equally and uniformly on all who were engaged in that task. Furthermore, the court stated, given the profit involved in highway construction, taxation of those participating in it was not arbitrary or unreasonable. Next, the court stated, the trial court erred in finding that the exemption was unconstitutional as discriminatory against the federal government and in striking the exemption. The court stated that the exemption was not severable from the statute in that the legislature did not intend that municipal contracts be burdened with the tax. Moreover, the court stated, the exemption had an obvious purpose of public policy. Finally, the court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the statute did not apply to a contractor building lighting systems for a highway. It noted that the statute was passed at a time when it was well known that highway construction involved the use of the skills of many contractors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the part of the trial court's decision which found that the exemption discriminated against the federal government. It affirmed the remainder of the decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city assessed a use tax on the taxpayers' purchase of out-of-state goods. The Department upheld the assessments, and the trial court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that selective enforcement of the use tax was not unconstitutional. The manner of the Department's enforcement was not an arbitrary or unjust plan to discriminate against some taxpayers while purposely failing to require others to pay. By limiting its attempts to enforce the use tax to personal property of individuals requiring licenses, the Department enforced the tax in the only rational and reasonable way possible. Also, although Ala. Code tit. 51, &sect; 788(3) provided a credit for sales and use tax paid to another state, &sect; 789(3) did not expressly provide a credit for sales and use tax paid to a city or county in another state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the parties' divorce, custody of their six-year-old son was granted to the mother. The father filed a petition to have permanent custody of his son on the basis that a substantial change in circumstances had occurred. The father lived in Alabama, and the mother had relocated to Florida with her third husband. The father alleged that the mother was unsuited psychologically and morally to have custody of their son. The court affirmed the trial court's order that denied the father's modification motion. The &quot;tender years&quot; presumption, which provided a presumption that a young child's best interest was served by being in the mother's custody, did not violate the father's equal protection rights. The rebuttable presumption merely allocated to the father the burden of showing that the mother was not the best custodian. The presumption was applicable to children of both sexes. The district court, as the trier of fact, had the responsibility of deciding which testimony that was heard ore tenus was correct and which inferences were to be drawn from the testimony. The district court's findings were not to be disturbed unless they were palpably wrong.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city brought an action against the taxpayer to collect an occupation license tax due pursuant to the terms of a city ordinance. The taxpayer alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutionally discriminatory and unequal under the U.S. and Alabama Constitutions in its provisions exempting those citizens earning $ 3,000 or less from its application. He also claimed that the ordinance's record-keeping requirement was a violation of due process and equal protection of the laws. The trial court granted the city's motion for a directed verdict. The taxpayer appealed. The court held that the taxpayer did not sustain his burden of proving that the ordinance was invalid. The ordinance was equal and non-discriminatory in its application and classification and was not unconstitutional. There was no merit in the taxpayer's contention that discriminatory and overly burdensome record keeping had been imposed upon him in contravention of due process and equal protection of the laws. The maintenance of records was integral to any system of taxation. As such, requiring those citizens whose employer did not make reports to keep their own records was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant creditor filed a petition for a writ of mandamus after the trial court (Alabama) dissolved an attachment against appellee debtor's property. The trial court held that Alabama's attachment law, Ala. Code tit. 7, &sect; 845 et seq., was unconstitutional in that it did not provide for notice and an opportunity for hearing prior to the taking of the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditor filed suit against the debtor, claiming a sum due by open account. The creditor also filed an affidavit commencing an attachment proceeding against the debtor's property. The basis of the attachment was the nonresidency of the debtor. A clerk issued the writ of attachment, and the sheriff took possession of the debtor's truck and trailer. The debtor then filed a motion to dissolve the attachment. The trial court dissolved the attachment. On appeal, the court granted the creditor's petition for a writ of mandamus. The court held that the attachment law, as it applied to nonresident defendants, whereby quasi-in-rem jurisdiction was obtained, was not unconstitutional for failure to provide for a hearing. There were extraordinary situations that justified postponing notice and opportunity for a hearing. The attachment law met the criteria of such situations because the seizure was directly necessary to secure an important governmental or general public interest, there was a special need for very prompt action, and the state kept strict control over its monopoly of legitimate force. The attachment law was not infirmed because of the difference in bond requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, an employee of appellant corporation for over 25 years, injured his back. The trial judge (Alabama) issued a decree finding that appellee had suffered a compensable injury from an accident which arose out of and in the course of his employment, that appellee had sustained a permanent partial disability of 75 percent to his body as a whole, and that appellee was entitled to a lump sum payment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge issued a decree finding that appellee had suffered a compensable injury from an accident which arose in and out of the course of his employment, that appellee had sustained a permanent partial disability of 75 percent to his body as a whole, and that appellee was entitled to a lump sum payment. On appeal, the court stated that the question was whether there was evidence to support the trial court's finding of total disability. The court stated that total disability under the Workmen's Compensation Act did not mean absolute helplessness or entire physical disability, but meant inability to perform the work of one's trade or inability to obtain reasonably gainful employment. Thus, the court held that a finding of total disability was supported by the evidence and therefore supported award of permanent partial disability. Even though the court's award of compensation was based upon a percent of permanent partial disability, such finding was not injurious to appellant. Further, the court held that Ala. Code tit. 26, &sect; 279(c)(9), which provided for a lump sum compensation payment, was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Madison County (Alabama) that after entering a divorce decree, awarded custody the parties children to appellee husband and the wife visitation, including two weeks during the children's summer vacation. The trial court also ordered the husband to pay $ 50 per week during the two week period of visitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife both asserted adultery as grounds for divorce. An interlocutory order awarded the wife custody of the children. The trial court rendered a decree of divorce on grounds of the wife's adultery and awarded the husband custody. On appeal, the court held that the divorce decree was proper. As there was no corroborative evidence of the husband's confession of adultery, the trial court did not have authority to grant a divorce to the wife for his adultery. Consequently, the doctrine of recrimination was not applicable. Regarding custody, the court held the trial court committed reversible error by misapplying the law to the facts. An adjudication of adultery on the part of the wife did not, in and of itself, bar her from having custody. The court determined that taking the children out of one immoral situation and placing them in another did not serve their best interests. Prior to the parties' separation the husband was at home only on weekends and during the five-year period of separation he had little contact with the children. Also, he shared an apartment with a woman to whom he was not married and her children. The court awarded the wife custody and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of the trial court's judgment that awarded the husband custody of the children. The court rendered a judgment placing the custody of the children with the mother and remanded for a determination of adequate child support and reasonable visitation rights for the husband. Otherwise, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The representatives sold high schools and junior high schools on a plan wherein students would earn money and prizes by selling magazine subscriptions. The student salesmen sent all magazine subscription orders to the corporation after deducting their commissions from the money collected. The department determined that the corporation was an out-of-state vendor which had the duty to collect use tax. The trial court affirmed the department's use tax assessment and the court upheld the trial court's decision. Under &sect;&sect; 790(c), 792(c), the corporation was required to remit the use tax. The corporation's sales of magazine subscriptions through student salesmen were retail sales of tangible personal property. There was a sufficient relationship between the corporation and the schools to establish that an agency relationship existed between them. Further, the students selling the magazine subscriptions were salesmen for the corporation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Act, the trial court appointed a panel of commissioners to assess the taxpayers' real property.

There was no bias or prejudice by the trial judge when he questioned the state's expert witness. Certain testimony of a witness was clearly inadmissible. However, the state failed to raise a proper objection. The trial court did not commit error where it failed to rule on an objection to the admission of illegal evidence. The trial court would not be reversed for overruling an objection which failed to specify grounds where the evidence was not patently illegal. As there was no ratio which could have been used to satisfy both the requirements of Ala. Code tit. 51, &sect; 17 and Ala. Const. &sect; 217 the trial court did not err for choosing the least discriminatory ratio in relation to all of the collective property owners of the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff creditor appealed the decision of the Circuit Court of Tuscaloosa County (Alabama), which entered a judgment for defendant auto repair shop in the creditor's action in detinue against the shop. The shop claimed the right to possession and legal title by a bill of sale issued pursuant the Abandoned Motor Vehicle Act (Act), Ala. Code tit. 36, &sect; 159 et seq (1940), as amended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner financed the purchase of his car through the creditor. After an accident the owner had the shop fix his car. The owner failed to pay for the repairs so the shop retained possession of the car and notified the owner of its intent to sell the car to pay for the repairs under the Act. The car was sold and the president of the shop bought it. The creditor claimed that it had a right to possession and legal title from the security interest perfected pursuant to Ala. Code tit. 7A, &sect; 9-101 et seq. (1940), as amended. The court disagreed. The court found that where the abandonment of the vehicle occurred 60 days after the completion of the necessary repairs, the Abandoned Motor Vehicle Act, whose amendment became effective after the repairs were made but prior to the abandonment of the car, was operative against the creditor without being retroactive. Thus, although a mechanic's or materialman's lien was subordinate to any perfected security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code, the shop had priority because under the Act, abandoned vehicles could be sold to pay for the cost of repairs, and a bill of sale could be given free and clear of encumbrances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vendor operated vending machines located on an Air Force base and consequently were for the use of military personnel and civilian employees and were not open to the general public. Thus, the vendor argued he came within the &quot;industrial plant&quot; exception as provided in Title 51, Section 613, as amended, Code of Alabama 1940, as Recompiled 1958, and was not required to purchase individual vending machine licenses. The trial court agreed with the vendor. However, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court because, absent a statutory definition, the commonly accepted definition of such term must be applied. The common definition of &quot;industrial plant&quot; did not include an Air Force base. The Air Force base in question was a training facility and there was no evidence presented that the Air Force base was an &quot;industrial plant&quot; within the commonly accepted definition of that term. Furthermore, there was nothing in the applicable statute to indicate that the legislature intended to include military bases within the definition of &quot;industrial plants.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Code tit. 30, &sect; 7(1) (1940). The employer contended that the statute took property from the employer without due process of law and that it denied the employer equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ala. Code tit. 30, &sect; 7(1) (1940) required employers to pay their employees their usual pay when they served as jurors, less any pay that they received for their service as jurors. The court found that the employer's constitutional rights were violated when it was required to pay the employee during his absence from work for jury duty even though the employer received no services from the employee. The statute attempted to shift to private employers some of the expense of running the public function of the courts, and the court concluded that such action was a taking of private property that would require just compensation. The court found that the &quot;taking&quot; could not be justified under the state power to tax because the act was not a general tax measure, and the group bearing the burden, the employer, received no special benefit to justify singling that group out. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, holding that Ala. Code tit. 30, &sect; 7(1) (1940) violated the Fourteen Amendment and that it deprived the employer of due process and equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was the housing inspector for the city's engineering department. The position was in the classified service and it was created by the city's personnel board under its authority in 1947 Ala. Acts. 273. When the employee tendered his resignation, the city commissioners accepted it, but the employee rescinded it six days later, before the effective date of the resignation and before it was accepted by the acting city engineer. The city stopped paying his salary and abolished the housing inspector position, so the employee sued. Judgment was entered against the city and it appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that, under the 1947 Act, the city commissioners lacked authority to accept the resignation, which could only be accepted by the acting city engineer as the appointing authority, and the employee could rescind his resignation any time before it was properly accepted. Under the 1947 Act and 1961 Ala. Acts. 217, only the personnel board had authority to abolish positions in the classified service. The 1947 Act was not an amendment of the city's charter, in violation of Ala. Const. &sect; 104 (1901). Thus, the city's abolition of the housing inspector position was void.</SPAN></P>

The applicants appealed the Board's decisions to the circuit court. The circuit conducted a de novo review pursuant to 1966 Ala.

On appeal, the court first held that the circuit court acted properly in reviewing the Board's decisions under the procedure set forth in the Act. In so holding, the court rejected the Board's contention that the proper method of review was by writ of certiorari and, therefore, that the circuit court was limited to a determination of whether the decisions were arbitrary, capricious, or in excess of the Board's authority. Rather, the court found that the Act provided the sole method of review. The court then reversed as to one of the applicants, concluding that the circuit court erred in crediting the years that he worked under a licensed pharmacist in another state towards the 15-year statutory licensing requirement of 1966 Ala. Acts 205, &sect; 9. The court affirmed as to the other applicant, finding that the evidence supported the circuit court's conclusion that he met the requirements of &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker was killed in the course of his employment by a third party's negligence. The insurer voluntarily paid periodic benefits. The insurer was notified of the dependents' third-party action, which settled. The insurer refused to pay part of the attorney fees. The dependents sued. The insurer demurred. The trial court overruled the demurrer and awarded attorney fees to the dependents. The insurer appealed. The court affirmed. The dependents' complaint sufficiently alleged a settlement of the third-party action and that the attorney fees sued for were incurred in that action. Because the action was under the workmen's compensation law, an ad damnum averment was not required. Regardless of the amount sought in the complaint, the action was required to be brought in the circuit court. The dependents were not required to proceed against the employer prior to settlement to recover under &sect; 312. Section 312 provided that the employer was liable for the part of the attorney fees in proportion to the amount the employer saved. Section 312 was not so uncertain as to be declared inoperative or void for uncertainty. The amendment to &sect; 312 had not violated Ala. Const. art. 4, &sect; 45.</SPAN></P>

Code tit. 3, &sect; 79 (enacted 1939), plaintiff driver sought review of a decision of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which granted defendant animal owner's motion for a new trial on the ground of the refusal of the trial court to give at the animal owner's request the written general affirmative charge with hypothesis. The driver made an application for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Ala. Code tit. 3, &sect;&sect; 78, 79 (enacted 1939), it was unlawful for the animal owner to allow his bull to go upon the highway where it collided with the driver's car, which caused the driver to sustain the damages complained of. Under Ala. Code tit. 3, &sect; 79 (enacted 1939), the animal owner's liability for a vehicle-animal collision on a public highway was limited to those cases where it could be proven that the owner knowingly or wilfully placed such livestock on the highway where damages were occasioned. The court denied the driver's application for rehearing, corrected its prior opinion, and affirmed the judgment below. The provisions of &sect; 79 controlled the parties' dispute, and that section had not been repealed by subsequent legislation. The acts of the Alabama Legislature created the driver's right to a remedy, and he had to pursue the enforcement of that right in accord with &sect; 79. There had to be proof that the animal owner knowingly or wilfully placed the bull upon the highway where the accident occurred. The value of the bull negated the allegation that the animal owner acted in violation of &sect; 79. There was no error in the decision to grant the animal owner a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the application for rehearing, corrected its prior opinion, and affirmed the judgment of the trial court to grant the animal owner a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence to support revocation tended to show that defendant, who was acting as night clerk at a motel, asked a male guest if he desired a female companion.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the judges of said court are unable to reach an unanimous conclusion, or decision, in any case or matter before them, any one of said judges may certify to the supreme court any question or questions of law as to which said judges differ, stating such questions as abstract propositions, and the supreme court shall give its opinion upon the question so certified, and the opinions thus given by the supreme court shall be given the same effect by said court of appeals as it is required to give to the decisions of said supreme court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is now pending in the Court of Appeals a case on appeal from the Lee Circuit Court styled Walter Philpot, Jr. v. State of Alabama, 5 Div. 651, submitted December 2, 1965.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judges of this court &quot;are unable to reach an unanimous conclusion&quot; in this case because of their disagreement (1) as to the effect of Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (No. 762, June 20, 1966), on a confession made by a defendant in custody without his asking for counsel, and without the police advising him of the right not to speak admitted in evidence at a trial which began after June 22, 1964, and before June&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  13, 1966, to-wit, November 24, 1964; and (2) as to the effect of White v.

Judge Cates considers that this feature of the threejudge Federal Court decree is now manifestly in error under the reasoning of Johnson v. New Jersey, supra. In the instant cause, before qualifying the jury, a motion to continue was made on the ground &quot;that no women were on the jury venire called for the present term of court.&quot; The defendant claimed that women were systematically excluded from the venire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following abstract questions of law upon which the judges of this court differ in said case are hereby certified to your Honorable Court under said &sect; 88, supra:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Must the State show either:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) that defendant did not request counsel for consultation or presence before (or during) his interrogation; or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) that the police &quot;effectively warned him of his absolute constitutional right to remain silent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Should your Court consider&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the warning in 1 b) above should be shown to have been given, can compliance with the requisites imposed by the adverb &quot;effectively&quot; be shown by:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) Testimony consisting only of the opinion of the interrogators as to the defendant's comprehension of the warning; or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) Testimony both as to the opinion of the interrogators and some affirmative acknowledgment by the defendant that he intelligently grasped the substantial import of the warning?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Is White v. Crook, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">B.C.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 251 F.Supp. 401, 408-409, Part II, of binding force and effect other than as to actual parties defendant, the members and clerk of the Lowndes County Jury Commission?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. If your answer to B, above, is in the affirmative, then has Johnson v. New Jersey, supra, in effect overruled the postponement of relief to June 1, 1967, for compliance with White v. Crook, supra, Part II, as stated in paragraph 13, Part III, Relief?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record in this case, together with a draft opinion by Judge Cates are forwarded for your convenience.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c11">Questions A. 1. and A. 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. 1. In Johnson v. New Jersey, No. 762, June 20, 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States declared that the new rules enacted in Miranda v. Arizona, Nos. 759, 760, 761, and 584, June 13, 1966 [384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694], apply only to cases in which the trial began after June 13, 1966.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are, therefore, of opinion that in trials begun prior to June 13, 1966, the state is not required to show, as a predicate to the admission of evidence showing that defendant has made incriminating statements, that, prior to interrogation, defendant was effectively apprised of his privilege against self-incrimination or of his right to counsel as defined in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. 2. In the light of our answer to your question A. 1., question A. 2. requires no answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c11">Question B.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. We do not undertake to declare on the validity, effect, or extent of White v. Crook, 251 F.Supp. 401.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the force of White v. Crook, supra, may be, we are of opinion that Philpot is not in position to have relief by reason of that decision. From a viewpoint most favorable to Philpot, that holding appears to be that a prisoner, who is in position to do so, may complain of denial of equal protection of the laws resulting from exclusion of women from the jury. Philpot, however,&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is not a member of the group that has been excluded. As we understand the case, he is a man, not a woman. We do not think he can say he has been denied a jury of his peers. What one of the authors of White v. Crook, supra, said in another case seems appropriate here, to wit:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * *. In addition to these reasons, the record in this case affirmatively reflects that Blauvelt was not a member of the group that he contends was systematically excluded in selecting the grand and petit jurors which were used by the State of Alabama in Sumter County, Alabama, prior to and at the time of the proceeding of which he complains. He has no standing, therefore, to raise the issue of `systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand and petit juries of Sumter County, Alabama' upon the ground that he, a white man -- as was stipulated upon the pretrial of this case -- was denied his constitutional rights by reason of said exclusion. Bailey v. Henslee, 8 Cir., 264 F.2d 744; Hollis v. Ellis, D.C., 201 F. Supp. 616.&quot; Blauvelt v. Holman, D.C., 237 F.Supp. 385, 387 (1964)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c11">Question C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. Since our answer to your question B. is not in the affirmative, question C. does not appear to require an answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the Justices concur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts stated by Judge Cates in his original opinion are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">November 25, 1964, a petty jury convicted Philpot under an indictment accusing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  him of assault with intent to rape. Code 1940, T. 14, &sect; 38. The trial judge sentenced him to twenty years in the penitentiary, the maximum punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">October 6, 1964, the prosecutrix, a seventeen year old white girl, left work at about 10:50 P.M. As she was getting into the front seat of her car, a Negro man pushed her down on the seat and grabbed her throat saying, &quot;Take me to Chewacla.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She noticed that his trousers were unzipped.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;The scene was a few miles from Chewacla State Park in Lee County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a few minutes of struggling, the prosecutrix convinced the defendant that her father was on his way to see that she was &quot;Okay.&quot; The defendant got out and went away saying, &quot;I'm sorry, miss.&quot; To this apology the prosecutrix rejoined, &quot;Just go on.&quot; She went immediately to the police station and complained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About midnight Philpot was brought to the police station, seated against the wall in a back office, and confronted there with persons he had mentioned in apparently an exculpatory context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 2:00 A.M. he confessed, signing a statement saying that, while he was looking in the car for a purse, the girl came toward the car, that he lay down on the floor in the back of the car. &quot;I jumped&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  over the front seat and held her by the arm and was laying on her right arm where she was trying to close the right front door. She grabbed me by the front of my shirt and screamed two or three times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He gave no reason for the attack in the statement. One officer stated at one point Philpot said he thought the car only had two doors. The State laid the proper predicate (as then thought sufficient) to show that Philpot confessed voluntarily. The statement says that he was told that it could be used against him in court. One officer told Philpot, &quot;Truth is light.&quot;</SPAN></P>

City Code, &sect; 1159 (1944), and sentenced him to 90 days hard labor and fined him $ 75.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After services on Good Friday, 52 people left the church and marched peacefully on the sidewalk. They sang and clapped, but did not block the sidewalk or jay walk.; however, they did not have a parade permit from the city. The city charged the minister of parading without a license, pursuant to Birmingham, Ala., Gen. City Code &sect; 1159 (1944). The minister was convicted in a trial before the city recorder and then in a trial de novo in the circuit court. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction and discharged the minister sine die. The court determined that the ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, and that it had been applied in a way that established a pattern of discrimination and was not consistent with the city's own expressed interpretation of the ordinance. The court also determined that the evidence did not establish that the activity that formed the basis of the conviction was even a parade that required a permit under the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The trial court refused to charge the jury that if it believed the evidence, it would find defendant not guilty under counts four and five. The court reversed and remanded because the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions under counts four and five. There was no evidence that defendant used or had available for his use either any blunt instrument or any weapon, including shoes. The court held that it could not say as a matter of law that the evidence before the jury was undisputed as to defendant being the agent of the victim's death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trespassing statute, Ala. Code tit. 14, &sect; 426 (1940), required strict proof that defendant was warned off by one with proper authority from the person in possession. The minister's testimony was that he was minister of the church. No evidence was given of the express or implied power of a minister under any statement of general discipline of the denomination, if any, or of the congregational articles of incorporation or by laws or articles of association of the ecclesiastical society. No effort was made to show that the secular corporation held title for the benefit of an ecclesiastical body. Without more evidence, the court could not say the minister was a corporation sole. Nor did it find proof of his being the church's alter ego or vice principal. To say that a person was a minister of the gospel could not be taken to mean that ordination conferred any inherently greater power to admit or exclude than belonged to any other church member in good standing. For failure to prove agency to warn off, the judgment was reversed and the cause remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jefferson County (Alabama), which convicted defendant for entering a department store's restaurant and refusing to leave after being warned in violation of Birmingham, Ala., City Code &sect; 1436 (1944).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, together with another person, seated himself at the restaurant and was unable to get service from the waitresses. Defendant was then asked to leave, and he refused. A police officer was called, and the parties were subsequently arrested. Defendant contended on appeal that the complaint was insufficient to support a prosecution and that the complaint was so vague and uncertain as to not apprise defendant of what he was called upon to defend. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that defendant's demurrer to the complaint was properly overruled because defendant failed to present the specific defects, as alleged, to the complaint. The court determined that the prosecution was for criminal trespass on private property, that defendant had entered the store with no interest in the premises, and that the store could limit the use of its own premises as it saw fit. Once defendant was requested to leave by a store official, and he refused to leave, his status as an invitee licensee was destroyed and he was thereafter on the premises as a trespasser. As a private business, the store had a right to revoke defendant's status at will.</SPAN></P>

The county court overruled defendant's motion to exclude the evidence and discharge him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a member of a branch of the religious sect which believed in the handling of poisonous snakes as a test of faith. A witness for the prosecution was a member of the branch that did not have that belief. The charges arose when the witness was invited to a meeting of the snake-handling group. Defendant was convicted of violating the statute that provided that it was unlawful for any person to display, exhibit, handle, or use any poisonous or dangerous snake or reptile in such a manner as to endanger the life or health of any person. Defendant argued that the indictment was defective because it did not state the time of the commission of the alleged offense. The court did not sustain defendant's insistence because it was not challenged by a demurrer although demurrer would have been appropriate because time was material when the grade of the offense changed. The statute was not an unconstitutional violation of freedom of religion because the law was enacted for the purpose of restraining and punishing an act which had a tendency to disturb the public peace. It was sufficient to show that the life or health of one person was endangered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence was ample to sustain the judgment of conviction and the court's action in overruling the motion for a new trial was without error. Therefore, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
