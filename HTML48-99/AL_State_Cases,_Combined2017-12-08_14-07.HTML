</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's murder was made capital because the victim was a law enforcement officer who was killed in the line of duty and the murder occurred during the course of a robbery. Defendant argued that his constitutional protection against being tried twice for the same offense was violated because he had already been convicted in federal court. The court determined that the Alabama legislature did not intend to limit dual prosecutions by federal and state courts. No violation of defendant's constitutional protection against double jeopardy occurred because separate sovereigns brought both the state and federal prosecutions. The court also rejected defendant's remaining arguments. Defendant failed to demonstrate that the trial court committed error sufficient to warrant reversal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Madison Circuit Court (Alabama), which denied her motion for a judgment of acquittal and entered judgment on a jury verdict that defendant was not suffering from a mental disease or defect at the time that she committed a murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed a man in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-6-2 (1975). She was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in the state penitentiary. Defendant appealed her conviction, contending that the trial court erred in having denied her motion for a judgment of acquittal and that the jury erred in having found that defendant had not suffered from a mental disease or defect at the time of the shooting. The court affirmed the defendant's conviction. The court found that, under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-3-1 (Supp. 1990), defendant had the burden of proving the defense of insanity by clear and convincing evidence. The court said that the statute contained only a &quot;cognitive&quot; test -- i.e., whether defendant had an inability to appreciate the nature and quality or wrongfulness of her acts. The court found that defendant had not sustained her burden of proof on the defense. While the court found that defendant presented expert testimony as to her lack of mental capacity, it said that the jury was not bound to have accepted that evidence. Moreover, the court said, evidence of the circumstances of the crime tended to show defendant's sanity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed an application for rehearing of the court's decision on defendant's appeal from the judgment of the Pike Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted defendant of theft of property in the second degree and sentenced him to 18 years in the state penitentiary pursuant to the Alabama Habitual Felony Offender Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On defendant's application for rehearing, the court held that: (1) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized from his truck because the evidence showed that defendant's consent to the search was voluntary and defendant's consent to a search of his truck was unnecessary since boots matching the description of stolen boots were in &quot;plain view&quot; through the window of the truck; (2) Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-4(g) (1975) did not constitute a constitutionally prohibited ex post facto law because when defendant committed the crime of theft of property in the third degree after previously having been convicted of theft of property in the second degree, he was charged by law with knowledge that if he committed the felony he would be subject to punishment under the Habitual Offender Act; and (3) the trial court did not err by allowing the state to present evidence of defendant's prior conviction for theft of property in the second degree because the trial court thoroughly instructed the jury to disregard the prior offense when considering the guilt or innocence of defendant and because the prior conviction was an element of the charged offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's application for rehearing, withdrew the court's original opinion, and affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Marshall Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted defendant of receiving stolen property in the first degree, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-16 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When an informant saw the police, he dropped three radios he was carrying and ran from an automobile dealership. He was later arrested for breaking and entering, and he alleged that he had planned to sell the radios to defendant. The police then set up a sale of 11 radios to defendant. Prior to the sale, the police obtained an &quot;anticipatory search warrant&quot; for defendant's place of business. The informant entered defendant's place of business and made the sale. Thereafter, the radios were seized in a search of the premises pursuant to the search warrant. On appeal from defendant's conviction for receiving stolen property in the first degree, under &sect; 13A-8-16, the court held that: (1) the instruction to the jury that, as a matter of law, the property was stolen deprived defendant of his right to a trial by jury in that he had a right to have each element of the charge proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and such error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) although the anticipatory search warrant was invalid under Ala. R. Crim. P. 3.8 because the evidence was not in defendant 's possession when it was issued, the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which had convicted defendant of receiving stolen property, and remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested by his probation officer but escaped the officer's custody. Appellant's probation was later revoked by the trial court on the ground that he escaped from custody following a lawful arrest by his probation officer. Appellant sought review and contended that he could not be guilty of escape because the arrest was unlawful, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 15-22-54(d) (1975), because it was effected without a warrant or a written statement. The court disagreed and held that a probation officer charged with supervising a probationer had broader discretion in making a warrantless arrest than another law enforcement officer seeking to arrest a person not yet convicted of a crime. The court reasoned that to construe &sect; 15-22-54(d) to require a probation officer to make a written statement to himself before effecting a warrantless arrest would cause needless and burdensome delay in the officer's ability to respond quickly to evidence of misconduct. The court also noted that the warrantless arrest was authorized by Ala. R. Crim. P. 27.4(c). The court held that appellant was legally under arrest and in custody at the time of his escape and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The case had been remanded for a determination as to whether blacks were prevented from serving as grand jury forepersons. The trial court found that no discrimination had occurred. On further consideration on appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction on the basis that the indictment should have been dismissed and remanded the case. The court noted that the prosecution was not prevented from indicting defendant again under a nondiscriminatory grand jury process. The court held: (1) that there was absolutely no question that defendant had made a prima facie case that blacks were discriminated against by not having served as grand jury forepersons because no black had ever served in such a capacity according to the county records; (2) that the prosecution had failed to rebut the prima facie showing of discrimination because no objective standard had ever been employed to select such a foreperson; and (3) that the trial court committed reversible errors in failing to strike prospective jurors for cause and in refusing to properly consider defendant's request to represent himself.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2) and (10), and 13A-4-2 and 13A-6-2 (1975). The Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama) denied defendant's motion for a new trial and imposed the death sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed several people before stealing an automobile. Defendant presented an insanity defense at trial and raised numerous issues on appeal. The court held that (1) the grand jury process was not abused where the dominant purpose of obtaining and presenting certain grand jury testimony was not post-indictment discovery; (2) the grand jury transcript did not contain exculpatory or impeachment evidence and the state's failure to produce it prior to trial did not constitute a Brady violation, (3) defendant's convictions did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because each offense required proof of an element that the other did not; (4) the statutory elimination of the volitional prong from the insanity defense and the repudiation of the diminished capacity doctrine was not unconstitutional; (5) defendant waived certain privileges by actively pursuing an insanity defense; and (6) defendant failed to prove insanity by clear and convincing evidence or that he was so intoxicated that he was unable to form the requisite intent. The court found no plain error and held that the death sentence was appropriate because the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"></DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision from the Calhoun Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted defendant of unlawful distribution of a controlled substance and sentenced him to 28 years' imprisonment. Defendant was sentenced pursuant to the Alabama Habitual Felony Offender Act (Act). His 28-year sentence included 5 years enhancement because the sale occurred on or near a schoolyard pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-250 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's 28-year sentence included another 5 years' enhancement because the sale occurred within three miles of a public housing project pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-270 (1975). The trial court enhanced defendant's sentence upon proof that defendant had pled guilty in 1985 to two counts of robbery in Georgia. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and remanded as to defendant's sentencing. The court held that where all the photographs in the lineup used to identify defendant had defects and depicted people with features similar to defendants, there was no merit to defendant's contention that the lineup used to identify him was impermissibly suggestive. The court held that defendant correctly argued that the state failed to prove that he was previously convicted of any felonies. Therefore, the trial court erred in applying the Act. The court held that the prosecution's evidence showing that defendant had been previously convicted of violating Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-8-40 was not sufficient to prove that, as a matter of law, defendant had been convicted of criminal conduct that would have constituted a felony under Alabama law at the time it was committed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court remanded for a new sentencing hearing to determine whether the conduct underlying defendant's prior Georgia robbery convictions would have been punishable as a felony if committed in Alabama at that time. The court held that, on remand, if the state failed to prove its allegations in that regard, then the trial court had to resentence defendant without applying the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated action, defendant sought review of the decisions of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted defendant of burglary in the first degree under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-7-5, and, on a trial de novo from the municipal court, convicted defendant of harassing communications under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-11-8 (1975) and of assault in the third degree under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-6-22.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his wife were estranged. He called his wife between 20 to 30 times a day and used abusive language. After the couple's separation and divorce, defendant forcibly entered the wife's residence and struck her. In a consolidated action, defendant was convicted of burglary in the first degree under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-7-5. On a trial de novo from the municipal court, defendant was convicted of harassing communications under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-11-8 (1975) and of assault in the third degree under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-6-22. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant's conviction for harassing communications did not violate his constitutional right to free speech. Further, the &quot;fighting words&quot; standard did not apply to &sect; 13A-11-8 because the statute did not regulate speech but rather the intentional use of private communication to harass or alarm the receiver. Moreover, defendant's burglary conviction was proper because sufficient evidence supported the jury's finding that defendant was not licensed, invited, or privileged to enter the wife's premises. Finally, there was sufficient evidence of physical injury to support defendant's assault conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decisions convicting defendant of burglary in the first degree, of harassing communications, and of assault in the third degree.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed the two victims and then disposed of their bodies with the help of his brother. Defendant was convicted of two charges of murder made capital because two or more persons were killed as the result of one cause of conduct. The trial judge overrode the recommendation of the jury and sentenced defendant to death. Defendant appealed. Both the state and defendant agreed that defendant should be remanded for resentencing to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The trial court did not find any of the aggravating circumstances in Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-49 so therefore defendant's sentence of death was not based on the law and cannot stand. The court remanded the action for resentencing of defendant. The court further held that (1) there was no error in defendant's absence from his pretrial hearings where he was represented by counsel; (2) the prosecutor's comments did not prejudice defendant's right to a fair trial; and (3) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a change of venue because it adequately determined through voir dire examination that the prospective jurors were not biased by pretrial publicity.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-6-2 (1975). Defendant alleged error in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment because Ala. Code &sect; 12-15-34.1 (1975), which allowed him to be prosecuted as an adult, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 16 years old when he was charged with murder. Defendant alleged that &sect; 12-15-34.1 was unconstitutional, for it violated his equal protection and due process guarantees, and he alleged also that it was vague. The court affirmed his conviction. The court found that legislative classifications of levels of crimes was subject to rationality review. The court found a rational basis related to a legitimate government interest, retribution for serious crimes and deterrence in that juveniles would be prosecuted as adults. There was no equal protection violation because the statute did not allow prosecutors or police to decide to try him as a juvenile or an adult, it was compulsory. There was no due process violation because the statute was not vague or overbroad. The court found the words plain and unambiguous, so the court had to give effect to the legislative intent. The record did not show a lack of notice of the charges or denial of an opportunity to be heard before entering his guilty plea, so there was no constitutional right to a hearing in juvenile court regarding his prior record or potential rehabilitation in the juvenile system.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed ineffective assistance of counsel, that he was deprived of an impartial jury, and that his U.S. Const. amends. V, VI, VIII, and XIV rights were violated. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the petition, holding that the sentence was appropriate because the murder of a law enforcement officer in the course of his duties was an offense for which the death penalty was generally imposed. Defendant's claim that his attorney had a conflict of interest based on his friendship with the victim was not newly discovered evidence where it had been acknowledged to the jury. The petition did not constitute a critical stage of the proceedings and the right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI did not extend to a psychological evaluation for the purpose of a Rule 32 petition. The petition was not a proper method of presenting claims of prosecutorial misconduct.</SPAN></P>

At the trial, he asserted an insanity defense, but was convicted and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and remanded for further sentencing findings to allow adequate review. The court found no plain error in the trial court's failure to define &quot;wrongfulness&quot; to the jury during its insanity charge because that issue was not a focus of the defense theory. The court found no error in the trial court's failure to find the alleged statutory mitigating circumstances, but the court failed to state whether it found any nonstatutory mitigating circumstances, a finding necessary to review the propriety of the death sentence. The court held that although the prosecutor's conduct was inappropriate in certain circumstances, it did not result in reversible error. The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on the consequences of a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. The court found no error in the jury selection process. The court held that the videotape of the crime was properly admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the Talladega Circuit Court (Alabama) of two counts of capital murder and one count of attempted murder. Defendant was sentenced to death on the capital murder convictions and to life imprisonment on the attempted murder conviction. Defendant appealed his convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised numerous issues on appeal, most of which were not brought to the trial court's attention. Because the cause involved the death penalty, the court was obligated under Ala. R. App. P. 45A to apply the plain error doctrine to defendant's contentions. The court rejected all of defendant's arguments regarding the guilt phase of the trial and, accordingly, affirmed defendant's convictions. However, the court agreed with defendant's contention that the trial court erred in allowing the state to present certain additional evidence at the penalty phase. The court found that the evidence pertaining to defendant's living conditions and the evidence that defendant had fled the jurisdiction after the murders was unlawfully received because it tended to present non-statutory aggravating circumstances that prejudiced the jury against defendant. The court noted that the jury's vote at the penalty phase was 10 in favor of imposition of the death penalty and 2 opposed. Under the such circumstances, the court found that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the court reversed defendant's sentences and remanded the case for a new penalty proceeding.</SPAN></P>

There was no Brady violation. There was no error in the trial court's rulings or in its handling of discovery. The trial court ordered the prosecutor to disclose any deals he had made with witnesses and the prosecutor represented that there were none. The record did not support and defendant failed to establish that there was a deal that a witness was released from prison in exchange for his testimony. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the proof of the predicate of unavailability of this witness was sufficient; thus, defendant's right to confrontation was not violated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that he was eligible for Class I correctional incentive time (CIT) earning status and that as a result he had to serve a longer sentence than would otherwise be required. The State filed a motion to dismiss the petition, arguing that the inmate was ineligible for Class I CIT earning status because the crime for which he was convicted, incest, was a sexual offense against a child under 17 within the meaning of Ala. Code &sect; 14-9-41(e) (1975). The inmate argued that the legislature did not intend for that provision to apply to the crime of incest, but instead intended for the provision to apply only to those crimes designated as sexual offenses and incest was not among those offenses. There was nothing in Ala. Code &sect; 14-9-41(e) (1975) to indicate that the legislature meant to prevent the classifying authorities for the department of corrections from looking at the facts underlying the crime for which an inmate had been convicted in order to assess the inmate's eligibility for Class I CIT earning status. The legislature's use of the words &quot;perpetration of sexual abuse&quot; was intended to include any sexual offense committed against a person under 17 years of age.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a third trial on the same four-count indictment, defendant was convicted of the capital offense of murder. The jury, after a separate sentencing hearing, unanimously recommended a life sentence. The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) then held a second sentencing hearing and overrode the jury's recommendation. Defendant was sentenced to death and appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in two robberies during which two men were shot and killed. Defendant was the confessed triggerman. His theory of defense was mistaken identity. The third trial, just like the first two, resulted in a conviction and a death sentence for the killing that occurred during the first robbery. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the evidence of the collateral capital offense was admissible as part of the res gestae of the charged capital offense. The crimes were intertwined and connected to such an extent that they formed one continuous transaction. Thus, the trial court's failure to list and to make findings in its sentencing order as to all of the alleged nonstatutory mitigating circumstances only indicated that it found that the evidence not mentioned was not mitigating. The fact that defendant's accomplice was sentenced to life imprisonment was not a mitigating circumstance. The court concluded that the trial court complied with the sentencing scheme of Alabama's death penalty statute and the sentence that it imposed, overriding the jury's verdict, met the constitutional requirements and was not arbitrary, discriminatory, or fundamentally unfair.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his wife were involved in divorce proceedings. Because of evidence of defendant's infliction of physical abuse and threats of future abuse, a temporary restraining order was issued that enjoined defendant from contacting or harassing his wife in any manner whatsoever. After numerous incidents of continued harassment of his wife, defendant was arrested when police found him in his truck, blocking the street in front of his wife's automobile. There was also a loaded handgun in the truck. At a prior contempt hearing, defendant admitted the factual allegations forming the basis of the contempt petition and was sentenced to five days in jail. Defendant argued that his subsequent indictment and conviction for reckless endangerment, disorderly conduct, and aggravated stalking violated the prohibition against double jeopardy. Defendant also claimed that the warrantless search of his truck was illegal. The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction because contempt proceedings for noncompliance with a lawful court decree were not &quot;criminal prosecutions&quot; as that term was commonly understood, and the warrantless search of defendant's truck was legal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss charges of stalking, &sect; 13A-6-90 and aggravated stalking, &sect; 13A-6-91, brought against him by the state on the ground that those sections were unconstitutional for vagueness and overbreadth because they failed to define the words &quot;repeatedly&quot; and &quot;series.&quot; The trial court agreed with defendant, and dismissed the charges. The court reversed on appeal. The court noted that &sect; 13A-6-90 included a specific intent requirement that the offense have been intentional, which ameliorated vagueness problems. The court also held that vagueness problems were mitigated in &sect; 13A-6-90 because of the requirement that defendant have made a credible threat, which meant that defendant knew his threatening speech was to have constituted a crime. The court also ruled that the words &quot;repeatedly&quot; and &quot;series&quot; were well-defined enough within &sect; 13A-6-90 that the section should not have been void for vagueness, because it was evident when applied that &sect; 13A-6-90 proscribed conduct of a perpetrator who followed or harassed a victim &quot;more than once&quot; and who made a credible threat with the intent to place the victim in fear of death or serious bodily injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment of a dismissal in the state's charges of stalking and aggravated stalking against defendant because the challenged statutory sections were not unconstitutional for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owner and business were each convicted on seven counts of distribution of obscene material, in violation of &sect; 13A-12-200.2(1) and sought review. The obscene material consisted of adult videos rented by undercover agents from the business on two separate occasions. The charges were based on the rental of five adult video tapes by the agents on one day and the rental of two tapes on their next visit. The court affirmed, holding that the indictment, which charged separate counts for each obscene tape rented in violation of &sect; 13A-12-200.2(1), was not multiplicitous. Further, the court held Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-200 did not violate the First Amendment or Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 4. The court held that &sect; 13A-12-200.1(1) codified the Miller test and was thus a valid constitutional regulation of obscenity by the state. The court further noted that, although &sect; 13A-12-200.1(1) contained language which was not in the Miller test, the statute properly and specifically defined obscene material and did not violate the First Amendment. Finally, the evidence clearly showed that the business owner &quot;knowingly&quot; distributed the sexually explicit videotapes that the jury found to be obscene.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of unlawful distribution of marijuana.

However, on appeal, defendant argued that the stipulation could not suffice as evidence for purposes of the application of the enhancement provisions of Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 13A-12-250, 13A-12-270. The court held that a stipulation was a judicial admission, and, as such, it prevented the party who made it from introducing evidence to dispute it. It also relieved a proponent from the necessity of producing evidence to establish facts admitted therein. A stipulation was a judicial admission, dispensing with proof, recognized and enforced by the courts as a substitute for legal proof. The court concluded therefore that the stipulation was evidence sufficient to establish that the sales took place within three miles of a school campus and a public housing project.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenge the denial by the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) of his petition pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 for post-conviction relief from his conviction and sentence for murder, robbery, rape, and mayhem. Because he was 16 when he pleaded guilty, he was tried as an adult and received concurrent life terms under Ala. Code tit. 62, &sect; 311 (repealed 1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 311, which was applicable only in Jefferson County, provided that males over 16 were treated as adults, while females between 16 and 18 were still considered juveniles. After &sect; 311 was struck down by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals as violative of the principles of equal protection, appellant filed a petition for post-conviction relief, arguing that the trial court had lacked jurisdiction to render a judgment in his case because &sect; 311 was invalid. He also asserted that his trial counsel's performance was deficient because counsel failed to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 311. The trial court denied the petition, and the court affirmed, finding that the invalidity of &sect; 311 did not render appellant's convictions void because Ala. Code tit. 13, &sect; 350 (Recomp. 1958), which was applicable statewide, also defined a juvenile as any child under the age of 16. Therefore, appellant suffered no prejudice because even in the absence of Ala. Code tit. 62, &sect; 311 (repealed 1975), the result would have been the same; that is, appellant would have been tried as an adult anyway under Ala. Code tit. 13, &sect; 350 (Recomp. 1958).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was paroled from prison after serving a portion of his sentence. One of the special conditions of his parole was that he was barred from a certain county. Appellant violated that condition and his parole was revoked. Appellant argued that his parole could not have been revoked for violation of an unconstitutional condition. Appellant's certificate of parole, duly signed and executed by him, clearly set forth the conditions of his parole. The court held that the complained of condition was not violative of the Alabama constitutional prohibition against exile. Appellant's acceptance of the conditions of parole was voluntary. If parole had not been granted, appellant's incarceration would have prevented him from going to the county anyway; thus, appellant failed to show any loss of liberty as a result of the condition. The condition was not unreasonable in light of appellant's past record and was in accordance with Ala. Code &sect; 15-22-26 (1975). Also, the parole revocation proceeding met due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was 17-years-old, escaped from a juvenile facility, then burglarized two homes, stealing several guns. Defendant then went to the home of a woman who splashed water on him with her car as he walked down a road earlier that day. After waiting for two hours, the woman arrived home with her two-year-old child and defendant shot her. The next day, defendant was arrested and confessed to all of the crimes. Defendant was convicted of burglary and theft for the two burglaries and sentenced to consecutive terms for each crime. Defendant was also convicted of capital murder and the jury recommended a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The trial court held another sentencing hearing and sentenced defendant to death. The court affirmed the conviction and death sentence, finding that the trial court complied with the death penalty statute and the sentence was strongly supported by the evidence as heinous. However, the consecutive sentences for both burglary and theft as to each of the two homes was an improper, double punishment. The trial court could have only sentenced defendant to one sentence or to concurrent sentences for each crime.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2) (1975) for intentional murder committed during the course of a robbery.

The court further held, inter alia, that: the defendant's claims of lack of education and intoxication were both factors to be considered in determining the weight and credibility to be accorded to the statement; the instructions did not misinform the jury, did not affect the defendant's substantial rights, did not constitute prejudicial error, and, therefore, did not rise to the level of plain error, Ala. R. App. P. 45A; the trial court properly instructed the jury as to the burden of proof for establishing mitigating circumstances; and the defendant suffered no undue prejudice due to the admission of crime scene photographs. Further, as required by Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-53, the court held that the death sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of stalking, violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-6-90 (1975). He was sentenced to seven years. On appeal, he contended that the statute was unconstitutional because it was vague and overbroad. The court held that the statute was not vague and overbroad, for it gave fair notice of the conduct that was proscribed. He further contended that there was no predicate established for the receipt into evidence of caller ID information. Specifically, he contended that the victim was not an expert on the use of caller ID, that caller ID was a new scientific device that had to meet the Frye test for admissibility, and that the evidence was hearsay. The court found there was no &quot;out-of-court asserter,&quot; because the caller ID display was based on computer generated information and not human input or observation. The court held that the only predicate necessary for the admission into evidence of caller ID evidence was that the caller ID device be proven reliable, which was established. The victim testified that when she received harassing telephone calls she would activate her caller ID, and in each instance the number displayed on the device was defendant's home telephone number.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of stalking. The court ruled that the stalking statute was not vague and overbroad, and that the only predicate necessary for the admission into evidence of caller ID evidence was that the caller ID device be proven reliable.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court first held that defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by the joinder of offenses. The court rejected defendant's argument that not all three victims could identify him. The court noted that two victims identified defendant and while the third could not identify him, defendant was in this victim's stolen car when he was arrested. Next, the court rejected defendant's argument that he was entitled to a new trial because he appeared before the jury in prison clothes. The court noted that defendant himself refused to change into street clothes. Defendant could not appeal an invited error. Finally, the court held that his sentence under the Habitual Felony Offender Act, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-9, was constitutional and not unduly harsh.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for murder made capital because it was committed during the rape and intentional killing of the victim.

On appeal, defendant contended that he was denied a fair and impartial trial and in support of that contention he cited alleged errors that the trial court had made in its instructions to the jury and in the manner in which it permitted the prosecution to conduct its closing argument. The court noted that as defendant had failed to lodge relevant objections below, it was obligated to review the record for plain error. The court in turn found no plain error or defect that might have adversely affected defendant's substantial rights in the record of the criminal trial below.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prison inmate challenged a ruling from the Elmore Circuit Court (Alabama), which denied the inmate's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The inmate contested the calculation of his incentive good time (IGT) status.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate, who was in prison for first degree robbery and rape, was serving two concurrent sentences of 50 years each and had been placed on IGT in accordance with Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 14-9-20 through -25 (1975); he lost that status six years after placement because of a minor infraction of a disciplinary rule. The inmate responded with a petition for habeas corpus that was marred with allegations that were described as fragmented and convoluted. The circuit court denied the petition. The court remanded the cause with instructions that the circuit court treat the merits of the petition and make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law. Pleading niceties were not favored in habeas corpus proceedings. The inmate had only one disciplinary action because of a minor infraction and had alleged in his petition that had he not been unconstitutionally removed from IGT status that his sentence would have been served. It was abundantly clear that the inmate's IGT status was governed by &sect;&sect; 14-9-20 through -25; in its motion to dismiss, the State missed the inmate's allegations and applied the wrong statutes governing the inmate's eligibility and the calculation of the inmate's good time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the cause for the circuit court to treat the merits of the inmate's petition and to make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was shot three times during a burglary. Defendant's conviction was affirmed. The court first held that the trial court had not erred in denying defendant's motion for a change of venue because defendant failed to produced any evidence to show that coverage was so prejudicial and had so saturated the community that jury prejudice should have been presumed. Additionally, the jury voir dire was very extensive, and defendant offered no evidence that any of the jurors indicated an inability to render a fair and impartial verdict based on the evidence adduced at trial. Second, because defendant was driving a truck that his co-defendant had rented, when he was arrested, and the co-defendant was not present at the time of the arrest, defendant lacked standing to challenge the search of the truck and seizure of evidence found therein. Third, defendant failed to establish a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section requirement because he failed to prove that blacks or women had been systematically excluded from the jury selection process. Finally, the court found no other error that required reversal of defendant's conviction or sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction and sentence by the Montgomery County Circuit Court (Alabama). Defendant was convicted of murder made capital because the murder was committed during the commission of a rape, a burglary, and arson, under Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 13A-5-40(a)(3) (1975), 13A-5-40(a)(4) (1975), and 13A-5-40(a)(9) (1975). Defendant was sentenced to death by electrocution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that Alabama's system for compensating attorneys appointed to represent indigent defendants, set out in Ala. Code &sect; 15-12-21 (1975), was unconstitutional. Defendant also claimed that the trial court erred in denying two of his discovery motions and that the trial court's denial violated the Brady rule. Finally, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his videotaped confession. The court rejected defendant's contentions and affirmed his conviction and death sentence. The court found that Alabama's system for compensating appointed attorneys did not violate principles of due process or equal protection and that &sect; 15-12-21 did not constitute an unlawful taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Further, the court ruled that defendant had not shown how the evidence that was not allowed to be discovered was either exculpatory or material, and thus the trial court did not violate Brady by denying defendant's discovery motion. The court also held that there was sufficient evidence presented to show that defendant's confession was voluntary and that the trial court did not commit an error in admitting it.</SPAN></P>

The court found the informant testified that the tape recorder was in proper working order at the time the conversations were recorded, and that he listened to the tape recordings, and reviewed the transcripts several times and both accurately reflected the conversations with defendant. The court held that the State did not have to prove chain of custody for the tape recordings. The court also held that defendant was not denied his right to confront a State witness regarding evidence lost in other drug cases because the right to confrontation, did not extend to matters which were irrelevant and had little or no probative value. Finally the court concluded defendant was properly sentenced under the schoolyard enhancement statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-250 (1975) because &sect; 13A-12-250 did not have to be referred to in the indictment and there was evidence that the sale occurred within three miles of a school.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 61-year-old man, raped a 10-year-old girl. The victim testified against defendant but did not remain in the courtroom thereafter. The victim's mother sat at counsel table during the trial. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court ruled that defendant's argument that Ala. Code &sect; 15-14-56(a) was unconstitutionally vague was not presented below and would not be considered on appeal. In any event, &sect; 15-14-56(a) was not unconstitutional. In addition, defendant's counsel stipulated at trial that the victim was unable to attend due to her age and mental condition. The court ruled that defendant was able to confront his accuser when she testified against him. The court noted that in a child sexual abuse case the right of face-to-face confrontation was not absolute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the denial of his Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 petition for post-conviction relief by the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama). Defendant was convicted for murder, a violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-6-2 (1975), and was sentenced to 99 years in prison. The subject petition collaterally attacked his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted inter alia that his conviction was improper because his attorney failed to file a supplemental brief objecting to the jury instruction regarding reasonable doubt, which defendant noted used the terms &quot;moral certainty&quot; and &quot;actual and substantial doubt&quot; to describe reasonable doubt, and because his attorney failed to move for a change of venue; defendant was tried in the county where the body of the murder victim was found. The United States Supreme Court case upon which defendant based his first assertion was released while defendant's case was pending on direct appeal and was later modified by the Court. The court affirmed the conviction. While the jury instructions did contain the terms noted by defendant, the instructions, taken as a whole, explained reasonable doubt in a manner that satisfied both of the new cases handed down by the Court; therefore, defendant did not show that his attorney's performance was deficient by not raising the issue on appeal. The trial court had proper jurisdiction because the finding of the body of a murder victim was sufficient evidence that venue in the county where the body was found was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the capital offense of murder. After considering the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment, the judge sentenced him to death. Defendant asserted several arguments on appeal including that it was reversible error to deny his motion to suppress an incriminating statement made to police because it was obtained in violation of his Miranda rights. After having waived his right to an attorney in writing, defendant queried as to whether it was too late for a lawyer. The investigator responded that it was never too late for a lawyer. After a short deliberation, defendant then confessed. Upon review, the court held that whether there was a voluntary and knowing waiver of Miranda rights had to be decided from the totality of the circumstances. The investigator asked defendant on three separate occasions if he wanted counsel before he made his taped confession. The court held that the question of whether it was too late for a lawyer was not a request for counsel and that under the circumstances, the investigator properly determined defendant had not indicated a desire to talk with counsel. The decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the Tuscaloosa Circuit Court (Alabama) of two counts of failing to redeliver a leased vehicle, a violation of Ala. Code &sect; 32-15-6 (1975). Defendant was sentenced to three years' imprisonment on each count, with the sentences to be served concurrently. Defendant was also ordered to pay restitution and to pay $ 50 to the Crime Victim's Compensation Fund. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment against defendant contained four counts, each alleging a violation of &sect; 32-15-6. The wording of each count was identical except for the date the agreement allegedly provided for the return of the leased vehicle. The jury acquitted defendant of two of the charges and convicted defendant of the remaining two charges. The offense defined in &sect; 32-15-6 had three elements: (1) The lease of a vehicle under a written agreement providing for return of said vehicle to a particular place, or at a particular time; (2) the failure to return that vehicle to said place and within the time specified; and (3) the failure to return the vehicle within 48 hours after service of a written demand to do so. By not returning the vehicle upon request after failing to make the rental payments as scheduled and after having received proper notice, defendant violated both the terms of the lease agreement and &sect; 32-15-6. The court thought such construction afforded defendant reasonable notice and comported with common sense and fair play.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the cause with instructions that one of defendant's convictions be set aside. The circuit court acknowledged that defendant had committed only one criminal act. Therefore defendant could receive only one sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was twice charged for violating Ordinance 37-91, and, having been previously convicted for the violation, challenged the subsequent conviction on the sufficiency of the evidence and constitutional grounds. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that there was minimal evidence in the record to support the conviction, even as resort to an inference from the testimony of a housing inspector that the area was not properly screened was necessary. The court further held that the ordinance was specific enough to afford a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what conduct was forbidden, and thus was not void for vagueness. The court concluded that where the ordinance specified that after 15 days, each day that a violative condition remained constituted a new offense, defendant's right against double jeopardy was not violated, reasoning that her violation was not a continuing one where her subsequent violation was a failure to remedy a violating condition which continued to subject the public to the negative effects of that failure. The court also reasoned that to hold otherwise would have in effect granted defendant a license to commit the offense in question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in connection with the stabbing death of the victim. On appeal, the court rejected his argument that he was denied equal protection of the law in that the State exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of his race. Defendant failed to preserve his Batson objection. He also failed to establish a prima facie violation of the Sixth Amendment fair cross-section requirement because the prospective jurors were randomly selected from a list of licensed drivers. There was no error in the admission of a videotape of the crime scene which showed the victim's body because it corroborated the testimony of the investigating officer. Defendant was not entitled to a mistrial based on a witness's references to the fact that defendant had previously been incarcerated. Such statements were eradicated by the trial court's prompt curative instructions. The trial court's refusal to give jury instructions on intoxication and manslaughter was not reversible error because there was no evidence of defendant's intoxication.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two capital murders and sentenced to death after he beat an elderly couple to death with a barbell in order to steal $ 500 and their car. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and the sentence imposed on him. The court found that defendant failed to establish that the prosecutor exercised his preemptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner after examining the reasons offered by the prosecutor for his challenges. It was not an error when the trial court refused to dismiss for cause venire members who made statements generally supporting the death penalty. Although the prosecutor's comments to the jury about the nature of their advisory sentence in death penalty cases in Alabama was improper, the court found that it did not constitute reversible error. The court affirmed the trial court's decision to deny defendant's request for $ 3000 so that he could hire an investigator because defendant failed to establish that a critical piece of evidence was involved. The court found that testimony from defendant's family was not relevant mitigating evidence during the sentencing phase of the trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of murder committed during the course of a robbery in the first degree and sought review. The court reversed the conviction and the supreme court reversed that judgment and remanded. On remand, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence. The court held that the trial court had not erred by receiving into evidence items that were obtained pursuant to a search incident to defendant's arrest. The court found that based on the evidence presented at trial, it appeared that the police officer relied on articulable facts in a bulletin that supported a reasonable suspicion that defendant was a suspect wanted in connection with a robbery-murder in Alabama. The court held that the indictment, charging defendant with murder during the course of a robbery, was not unconstitutionally vague because robbery was an offense against the person; therefore, the value of the property taken during a robbery was not an element of the crime. The court held that defendant was not unfairly denied a continuance in his trial because whether to grant a continuance was within the discretion of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment and sentence of Madison Circuit Court (Alabama) that, following a jury trial, convicted him of capital murder in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2) (1975). The jury recommended that defendant be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The trial court declined to accept the jury's recommendation and sentenced defendant to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of killing a convenience store clerk in the course of a robbery. On appeal, the court determined that there was probable cause for the arrest and that exigent circumstances justified defendant's warrantless and nonconsensual arrest. The court rejected defendant's contention that the warrantless search of his residence was illegal. Defendant's sister and his mother, who owned the residence, gave their consent to a search of the residence. The court also ruled that any error that occurred when defense counsel challenged an Asian-American juror on account of race was invited error. The court reviewed the trial court's instruction concerning the &quot;especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel&quot; aggravating circumstance and found no error in the instruction. Any error that may have occurred during the sentencing phase was harmless because the jury recommended life imprisonment without parole. As required by Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-53 (1975), the court reviewed the propriety of defendant's sentence of death and examined the record for plain error. The court held that defendant's conviction for the capital offense and his sentence were proper and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the denial of his postconviction petition. The court determined that only a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was reviewable, as the other issues were procedurally barred from collateral review by Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.2(a)(2), (4), and (5). The court affirmed the denial of post conviction relief because it found that defendant was not deprived of effective assistance of trial or appellate counsel. The court found that defendant's counsels' performance was not deficient and that he was not prejudiced. There was no evidence that: 1) defendant was excluded from voir dire; 2) the photo identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive; 3) one missed objection and the injection into evidence of lie detector test results did not prejudice defendant; 4) erroneous instructions as to the presumption that a witness's testimony was truthful inured to the benefit of all witnesses; 5) it was reasonable not to offer additional mitigation evidence on resentencing in light of the trial judge's generous mitigation findings and the defense's strategy of attacking the aggravating circumstances; and 6) failure to predict a reinterpretation of the law was not deficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no merit to appellant's arguments that the indictment against him did not adequately apprise him of the charges against him and that his constitutional rights were therefore violated; that the trial court erred in failing to hold a competency hearing; that appellant was denied a fair trial because members of the jury saw him in handcuffs and in a prison uniform; or that the arresting officer did not have the authority to arrest appellant on an outstanding traffic warrant. There was not sufficient evidence presented that the DNA test performed in the case was reliable. Thus, the trial court should have not allowed the DNA testimony to be received into evidence. However, the court concluded that admission of the DNA evidence, although error, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

The court held that: 1) the two capital murders should not have been joined in the same count of the indictment, however, the error was without injury because defendant could lawfully have been indicted for two counts of capital murder; 2) there was no evidence that blacks and disabled individuals were systematically excluded from jury service; 3) the prosecution gave valid reasons for striking for cause several prospective jurors; and 4) the urging of defendant by his half-brother to confess did not render defendant's statement involuntary because the half-brother did not indicate that he had, nor did he have, the authority to promise defendant leniency.

The court disagreed with defendant's claim that the State failed to notify him of an intent to apply the enhancement statute because the State indicated its intent at the sentencing hearing and presented evidence that the sale occurred within 1.4 miles of a middle school and 1.6 miles of a housing project. Because defendant had an opportunity to defend the application of the enhancement statute, any error was harmless, at most. However, remand was required because the officer admitted that he did not know if the project was a public housing project. As such, the State failed to prove that the sale occurred within a three-mile radius of a public housing project.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised four issues on appeal from his conviction of illegal transportation of prohibited liquors. In affirming, the court held that defendant's sentencing was proper despite the fact that the sentencing judge was not the judge who preside over defendant's trial and furthermore, that issue was not properly preserved for review on appeal. The court further held that the search of his automobile and his pockets and the seizure of alcoholic beverages from the trunk of his car did not violate defendant's constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure because the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant for transporting alcoholic beverages into a &quot;dry&quot; jurisdiction when defendant crossed the boundary and were justified in searching defendant's pockets as a search incident to a lawful arrest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged a judgment from the Madison Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted them of drug trafficking based on evidence seized during authorized searches at two locations. Defendants claimed that the police failed to comply with the knock-and-announce requirement at one location and that there was insufficient probable cause to issue the search warrant as to the other location.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The illegal drugs that were the subject of the trafficking charges against the four defendants were seized in two searches under two search warrants. In the first search, the police gave no notice of their presence or of the fact that they had a search warrant, and they made no request of the occupants to open the door. One of the officers testified that they shouted the word &quot;Police!&quot; as they raced down the driveway carrying the battering ram and immediately before ramming the door. Defendants also argued that there was insufficient probable cause to issue the search warrant for the second home. The court found that there were sufficient facts to connect the sale of drugs with the second home. Rejecting the State's contention that exigent circumstances justified the use of the battering ram to gain entrance to the first home, the court reversed the convictions on two counts of the indictment. The court held that all the items found as a result of the patently illegal search of that home were &quot;fruits of a poisonous tree&quot; and were not admissible in evidence. The court held that the officers had no knowledge of an emergency situation and that, thus, no exigent circumstances existed.</SPAN></P>

An infirmary nurse said she saw him laughing when a helicopter took the officer to the hospital. Defendant was tried for the murder of the correctional officer, a capital offense under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40 (1975). The trial judge overruled the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment without parole and sentenced defendant to death pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-47(e) (1975). The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to show intent. The court also held that defendant's claim that he was not informed of his right to be treated as a youthful offender was not supported by the record. There was no error in denying defendant's motion for change of venue based on his involvement in another officer's death. That death happened far enough in the past to not be a factor and it was also sealed. The State did not have to turn over evidence of the nurse seeing the inmate laughing about the wounded officer because it was not a statement made to an officer. The court also held that there was no need for a second Miranda warning before defendant's second interview with an investigator.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that while a defendant had a Sixth Amendment right to be represented by counsel or to represent himself, he did not have the right, under either the federal or state constitutions, to hybrid representation. The court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant and sentencing him to death, concluding that while prison officials must provide prisoners with direct legal assistance or access to a law library, they were not required to provide both, so long as the constitutional requirement of meaningful access was met.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant failed to show that the venire was so tainted that he was unable to obtain a fair trial. Defendant next argued that the trial court erred in holding a hearing on pre-trial motions in his absence because it denied him a fair trial. The court concluded that defendant's presence would have been useless to his defense as the pretrial hearing was not considered to be a &quot;critical stage&quot; of the trial. Defendant's absence at the hearing on various legal motions in no way prejudiced him.

The court concluded that his prosecution was not discriminatory or arbitrary and did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. The court found that defendant could not rely on written opinions of the attorney general, because they were not directed to him and were issued after defendant's actions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a licensed day-care person, had the care of an infant, allegedly shook the infant, and caused the infant to hit her on the head on the floor resulting in the infant's death. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held the matter was not properly reviewable by petition for writ of mandamus because defendant could have ultimately challenged her conviction on direct appeal. The court then held that &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(15), the child-murder provision of Alabama's capital offense statute, was not constitutionally overbroad. The court determined that &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(15) was reasonable and invaded no area of protected freedoms. The only act forbidden by &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(15), was an intentional killing and that defendant had no right to murder a 15-month child. The court further held that defendant did not have a legitimate ground to complain about &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(15) because &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(15) was not unconstitutionally vague. Furthermore, &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(15) was neither arbitrary nor capricious because after a defendant was found guilty of the intentional murder of a child under 14, at least one of the aggravating circumstances enumerated in Ala. Code &sect; 13A-4-49 must have been found.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating the Vehicle Tinted Window Statute. She appealed. Defendant maintained that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it did not specify the degree of tinting allowed or prohibited. Ala.

Upon review, the court reversed the conviction and held that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the Alabama Department of Public Safety, as authorized by Ala. Code &sect; 32-2-9 (1975), proposed a new rule to regulate the degree of window tinting. A legislative committee on administrative regulation review approved the proposed rule. The court disagreed that the approved regulation cured any constitutional deficiencies in Ala. Code &sect; 32-5-215(d) (1975). Instead, the court ruled that the approved regulation was an improper attempt to circumvent the legislative process.

Following a hearing, the circuit court denied the motion and upheld the statute. The defendant filed a petition for a writ of mandamus. The court denied the petition. The court granted a review in the interests of judicial economy even though post-conviction appeal was proper. The child murder statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad because there was no constitutional protected right to murder and therefore no unreasonableness or invasion of a protected freedom. The child murder statute was not void for vagueness because it clearly informed people of the prohibited conduct and the defendant lacked ground to complain it was unclear as to her conduct. The child murder statute was not arbitrary or imposed solely on the basis of the victim's age, the capital defendants were sufficiently narrowed because at least one aggravating circumstance was required for the death penalty in addition to the intentional murder of a child. The child murder statute was not arbitrary because the special protection of children was rationally justified.</SPAN></P>

A police officer testified that defendant was cooperative and did not refuse the initial request to search. He was read his rights and told what the officers were looking for prior to the search. The court also held that the trial court erred by refusing to sever counts from the indictment and trial of defendant. The defendant had two victims, and the court found that the criminal acts alleged to have been perpetrated against the two victims took place at different times and under different circumstances. The court found that the prejudice inherent in being forced to defend against the charges of the production of obscene matter involving both victims when defendant was additionally charged with the second degree rape of one victim, but not the other, was obvious.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-10-130 (1975). Defendant was appointed to represent an indigent defendant charged with rape.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant submitted a voucher for services in the amount of $ 1,300 and for expenses incurred in representation of the indigent defendant.

Defendant then filed a motion for prior approval of expenses he expected to occur in the retrial, which the trial court denied. When defendant refused to proceed with the second trial, the trial court found him in contempt. The court held that: (1) office overhead expenses were encompassed by the term &quot;expenses reasonably incurred&quot; as used in &sect; 15-12-21(d); (2) defendant had to be compensated in advance for office overhead expenses expected to be incurred in the second trial; (3) Alabama's system for compensating appointed attorneys neither violated the principles of due process or equal protection, nor constituted an unlawful taking of property in violation of U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for manslaughter and remanded the action for a new trial because the trial court compelled defendant's wife to testify against defendant despite the invocation by the wife of her spousal privilege not to testify and defendant's objections. Both the state and defendant filed an application for rehearing. The state established the methods used to safeguard and handle evidence of the shotgun shell used in the shooting. Evidence that an item had been placed in an envelope and that envelope had then been sealed was adequate circumstantial evidence to establish safeguarding of the item. There was no evidence of tampering and it was established to a reasonable probability that the object was in the same condition at the end of the chain as at the beginning of the chain. The trial court properly admitted evidence seized from defendant, his home, and his automobile, and that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. Defendant failed to raise the question of constitutionality under Ala. Code &sect; 15-12-20 (1975), therefore it was waived on appeal. There was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was cited under &sect; 11-8-21(b)(8)a after he failed to comply with the police officer's instructions to turn down the volume. The court agreed with defendant that the portion of the ordinance under which defendant was convicted was unconstitutionally overbroad and that therefore defendant's due process rights had been violated. The court reasoned that the provision failed to include a specific time frame within which it applied, failed to specify the level of sound required to violate the provisions, and failed to take into account the proximity of the sound to neighboring inhabitants or the actual impact on those inhabitants. The court noted that it had held a similar anti-noise ordinance overly broad because it failed to provide those parameters. The court acknowledged that the peace and tranquility of one's home was an important interest and deserving of protection but held that such protection was required to be narrowly drawn and applied so as to minimize its infringement on First Amendment freedoms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder and was sentenced to death. The conviction was affirmed on direct appeal and by the state supreme court. Defendant's first post-conviction petition, pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. Temp. 20, was denied.

Defendant appealed, challenging the order and alleging that the trial court erred in denying her second motion to amend her petition. The court found no abuse of discretion in the denial of defendant's motion for leave to amend because she did not timely file the motion to amend and the claims asserted were not based on surprise or newly discovered evidence. Although defendant raised a specific allegation of ineffectiveness of counsel based on a potential conflict of interest, she failed to establish an actual conflict of interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction stemmed from his failure to subscribe to a county's solid waste disposal service and his failure to pay the fees for that service, in violation of Ala.

After issuing its original opinion on appeal, the court granted rehearing and withdrew its original opinion. Contrary to defendant's contention that he and his family did not produce garbage, the court found that the State proved that defendant generated waste as defined in Ala. Code &sect; 22-27-2(2), (3). The State also proved that defendant failed to pay the mandatory fee and failed to obtain a certificate of exception. Moreover, the Act clearly provided criminal penalties for violations of its provisions. The court concluded that the Act was a reasonable and constitutional exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed, finding that, based upon the testimony of the arresting officer, it encouraged discriminatory enforcement because defendant would be allowed to continue on home if the officer determined that he was not intoxicated, or otherwise unable to drive.

The court found that (1) &sect; 13A-10-36 was not unconstitutionally vague because the language conveyed sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices; (2) the broom and pipe were deadly weapons because they were capable of causing death or inflicting serious physical injury; (3) the trial court had discretion in determining whether the State exercised its peremptory challenges in a discriminatory manner; and (4) a lack of disparate treatment of black and white members of the jury venire was indicative that the peremptory challenges against the black veniremembers were not racially motivated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of theft of property, receiving stolen property, and possession of burglar's tools and sentenced to a consecutive term of imprisonment. On review, defendant contended that he was improperly sentenced as a habitual offender because the State failed to give him notice of its intent to invoke the Habitual Felony Offender Act (HFOA) and also failed to prove that he had any prior convictions. The court found that notice to defendant under Ala. R. Crim. P. 26.6(b)(3)(ii) was a procedural requirement that could be waived by defendant's failure to object rather than a jurisdictional matter that was not subject to waiver. The court reasoned that the failure to object in the trial court to the State's method of proving or failure to prove prior convictions precluded consideration of the issue on appeal. It was also found that a response by defense counsel to the trial court's question regarding defendant's prior convictions was not the equivalent of an admission of prior convictions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the dismissal of his Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 petition by the Lee Circuit Court (Alabama). The petition contested the validity of his conviction for first degree robbery and his sentence. This petition was defendant's third petition collaterally attacking his conviction, but neither of the previous two petitions was adjudicated on its merits. Therefore, neither served as a procedural bar to this petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A statute of limitations period barred two claims asserted by defendant in his third petition. The claim of newly discovered evidence failed to allege a cognizable ground for relief because defendant failed to allege that he was filing his petition within six months after the discovery of the alleged newly discovered evidence. Thus, this allegation was procedurally barred by the six-month period of limitations designated for the ground of newly discovered evidence under Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.2(c). Also, defendant's allegation of ineffective counsel was barred by the two-year period of limitations found in the same statute. Defendant's final claim in his petition was that the trial court was without jurisdiction to impose sentence under the Habitual Felony Offender Act because the Act was unconstitutional and without force or effect. He specifically argued that the Act was not passed in accordance with Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 63.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was adjudged a delinquent after he was caught hunting without permission and without wearing blaze orange, but the juvenile court did not find the juvenile in need of care of rehabilitation. On appeal, the court remanded the case to the juvenile court. If the juvenile court found the juvenile delinquent, it was ordered to find the child in need of care or rehabilitation. Then it could remand the child to the custody of his parents. If the juvenile court did not find the juvenile in need of care or rehabilitation, the finding of delinquency had to be reversed. The court found that there was ample evidence to support the finding that the juvenile intentionally hunted on the lands of another without permission. The court rejected the juvenile's contention that the commissioner of the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources exceeded his legislative authority when he enacted the requirement that all hunters wear &quot;hunter orange.&quot; Finally, the court ruled that the juvenile waived his right to argue that the State failed to prove two violations of the hunter orange rule because the juvenile did not present that argument at trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was tried before a jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that the jury venire did not reflect a representative cross-section of the community and that the trial court erred in denying her motion to strike the venire and to assemble a new venire. She contended that this underrepresentation violated Batson v. Kentucky, but the court ruled that Batson was inapplicable to the case because there were no blacks stricken from the venire. Defendant failed to establish a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section requirement. Affirming, the court also rejected defendant's argument that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict. The testimony of an undercover narcotics agent that he purchased marijuana from defendant on two occasions was sufficient to support the jury's verdict. Based upon the evidence presented by the State, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal. Where defendant made no objections at trial concerning the enhancement of her sentences or the constitutionality of the Alabama enhancement statutes, her constitutional argument on appeal was not reviewed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that an award of retroactive credits good time was good to those eligible. However, the court also found that an exception, which did not allow the credits to prisoners convicted of sexual assault, applied to appellant. The legislature did not narrow the class of prisoners when it amended the statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 14-9-41(h). The statute was discriminatory because it treated appellant based strictly upon the timing of his conviction and sentence rather than rather than upon any determination about the nature or seriousness of the offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of selling cocaine and his sentence was enhanced because the sales occurred near a school and a housing project. On appeal, the court held that while the trial court's actions in making jury strikes on behalf of the prosecutor was highly questionable, defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced. Further, there was no indication whether the strikes were against blacks or whites, or that the trial court engaged in purposeful discrimination. The State established a proper chain of custody even though a cocaine rock was crushed during handling because it was reasonable probable that the cocaine was in the same condition although a different form as, and not substantially different from, its condition at the commencement of the chain. Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 13A-12-250, 13A-12-270 were not unconstitutional.&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-250 had previously been upheld against claims of overbreadth and vagueness, and claims that it violated the right to equal protection. Neither statute constituted uncharged crimes because they applied only to sentencing.

Code &sect;13A-11-61 (1975), defendant sought review of the judgment. The issue raised on review was whether the state's reasons for its peremptory challenges were sufficiently race neutral. The court held that although Batson applied to the striking of white veniremembers when they were struck on account of race, such was not the case in defendant's trial. In support, the court found that the state had struck the veniremembers for race-neutral reasons. The court held that a veniremember's physical disability or discomfort and a veniremember's inattentiveness were legitimate race-neutral reasons for striking the veniremember.

Defendant never filed a motion to dismiss until immediately prior to trial. A large amount of time was consumed by numerous motions filed by defendant. The court also rejected defendant's argument that evidence of pre-trial and out of court identifications were improperly admitted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant alleged that the trial court erroneously refused to admit testimony about prior acts of violence committed by the victim against members of defendant's family. The court found no merit to this contention because defendant and his family were permitted to testify about such matters. There was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction. The court held that the conviction for murder committed during a robbery in the first degree was proper despite defendant's contention that the robbery was not connected with the murder, but was an afterthought. The court held that the death penalty qualification of the venire did not violated his constitutional right to a fair trial by an impartial jury. It was not error to admit photographs of the victim's body because they were admissible to show the nature and extent of the wounds, and they tended to corroborate other evidence or testimony of witnesses, particularly that of the testifying accomplice. There was sufficient corroboration tending to connect defendant with the commission of the capital offense. The Alabama death penalty statute was held to be constitutional. The court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from Lauderdale Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted defendant of pharmacy robbery in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-51 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the robbery, controlled substances were stolen from the pharmacy. Defendant contended that the state failed to prove a proper chain of custody for the drugs admitted into evidence and that the state failed to properly identify the pistol used in the robbery. Two officers and a chemist testified regarding the chain of custody of the drugs. A state employee who also handled the drugs did not testify, but the other witnesses testified as to his receipt of the evidence from one witness and his subsequent return of the evidence to another witness. The court held that such testimony, when considered with testimony that the drugs were in a sealed envelope, was adequate circumstantial evidence to establish that the drugs were properly safeguarded and to treat the evidence as authenticated. As for the pistol, defendant admitted that he used it during the robbery, and the arresting officer identified it as the weapon removed from defendant's person. There was sufficient evidence of predisposition to commit the crime to negate a defense of entrapment. A remand for proper sentencing was necessary because the record was unclear as to the extent of defendant's prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment and fined. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that because defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was never presented to the trial court, the claim could not be considered on appeal. Defendant's remedy was to file a petition for relief from his conviction under Ala. R. Civ. P. 32. There was no objection to defendant's sentence at the sentence hearing. Defendant's guilty plea was not challenged by way of a motion to withdraw the plea or a motion for a new trial. Thus, defendant's contention that the sentencing judge improperly permitted the probation officer to determine his sentence was not properly preserved for appellate review. Further, the sentence imposed was clearly within the permitted statutory range.</SPAN></P>

He also claimed that the circuit court erred in considering a presentence investigation report that contained hearsay and victim impact information when determining the sentence to be imposed. The court upheld the judgment. The U.S. Supreme Court and the state courts consistently upheld the validity of advisory jury verdicts subject to judicial override. Further, &sect; 13A-5-47(e) was a clear expression of public policy as discerned by the legislature, and conformed to the statutory purpose of another state's statute as approved by the U.S. Supreme Court.

The trial court, overriding the jury's recommendation, sentenced defendant to death. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed the judgment.

Thus, there was no error in denying defendant's motion to quash the venire. The race neutral explanations given by the prosecution for striking potential black jurors were sufficient. Thus, there was no Batson violation. A review of defendant's statements clearly indicated that he sought to end interrogation on numerous occasions to no avail. However, because defendant did not confess or prejudice himself until the fourth statement, and because an intervening circumstance led to the fourth statement, there was no error in admitting his confession.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant waived his right to counsel and represented himself at trial. Initially, three different lawyers were appointed to assist him, but defendant asked each to withdraw. On appeal, the court affirmed and found that the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a competency hearing was not error. The court determined that the trial court took every precaution to ensure that defendant received a fair trial. The court would not reverse the denial of defendant's motion for a continuance because the trial court did not abuse its discretion. The court stated that defendant could have exercised his right to court-appointed counsel at any time, but he chose to represent himself at trial. The court also found that the victim's identification of defendant was correctly received into evidence. Additionally, the trial court informed defendant several times that if convicted he would be sentenced as a habitual offender. Defendant presented numerous issues on appeal that the court found either unsupported by the record or frivolous. The court found that the trial judge's performance was consistent with the highest traditions of an excellent trial judiciary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder and robbery, and he was subsequently sentenced to death. Appellant challenged his conviction and sentence on the ground that the prosecutor was guilty of racial discrimination in his removal of black members from the jury venire, improper removal of jury venire on other grounds, and improper admission of evidence. The court remanded for a new sentence hearing. The court held that the evidence of appellant's Florida conviction was improperly admitted because the conviction was based on a plea of nolo contendere. The court held that a conviction resting on a plea of nolo contendere was inadmissible for any purpose under Alabama law in a subsequent proceeding. Thus, only a sentence of imprisonment imposed upon a conviction recognizable under Alabama law could be considered in determining aggravating circumstances that could be considered in a death case. Appellant's conviction was affirmed because appellant's arrest was pursuant to probable cause and the evidence obtained following the arrest, including photographs, were admissible.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended there was insufficient evidence to sustain the verdict. He argued the state failed to prove he committed an &quot;overt act&quot; to support the charge; therefore, he could not be considered an &quot;aider or abettor&quot; to the sale. The court found that defendant, but suggesting where a police officer could purchase elicit drugs, participated in the sale, thereby providing a criminal linkage sufficient to support his conviction under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-211 (1975). The state suggested the case should be remanded for a new sentencing proceeding because of a conflict in the record concerning the exact sentence defendant received. The record revealed the trial judge orally imposed a five-year sentence at the sentencing hearing. After the state presented proof the incident took place within a three-mile limit of a school, the trial judge orally changed the sentence to five years and two days. However, the case action summary sheet indicated the sentence was seven years. In this instance, the court found defendant was not present when the correct sentence was entered against him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of murder for pecuniary gain.

Defendant filed an appeal and challenged almost all aspects of her trial and sentencing. The court rejected defendant's arguments and affirmed her conviction and sentence. The court held that defendant's presence was not required at every preliminary hearing, but that her right to appear and of confrontation only applied to &quot;critical stages&quot; of trial. The court found no reversible error in the jury selection because no bias or prejudice was shown. The court found no error in the indictment because it sufficiently set forth the charged crime. The court held that the admission of evidence, such as statements from co-conspirators and photographs, was proper and relevant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of assaulting a man with a box knife outside the bar and inflicting permanent injuries. The State struck three black prospective jurors, prompting defendant to raise a Batson challenge. Originally, the trial court sustained the challenge as to one of the jurors but later reversed itself because, upon further voir dire, the juror sated that she was the first cousin of a witness and admitted that she might be unable to be fair for other reasons as well. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant failed to prove a discriminatory intent by the district attorney or show that the trial court's ruling was clearly erroneous. Defendant's objection that photos admitted at trial did not accurately depict the victim's injuries was not preserved for appeal because he had raised a different ground for objecting to the photos at trial. Likewise, defendant's sentencing argument was not preserved because he did not object to sentencing at trial. The victim's testimony alone was sufficient to convict defendant of the offense of second-degree assault.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the circuit court never obtained jurisdiction in her case because the city failed to file a new complaint with the circuit court as required by Ala.

On appeal, the court overruled case law precedent relied upon by defendant and held that there was no requirement that the prosecuting authority file a new complaint in the circuit court when an appeal was taken from a conviction in municipal or district court pursuant to a valid uniform traffic ticket and complaint (UTTC). The court reasoned that while Ala. Code &sect; 12-22-113 required the prosecuting attorney to make a brief statement of the cause and complaint, that the requirement was one of notice and not a requirement for a new complaint.

The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) sentenced defendant to death, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state alleged that defendant entered a woman's apartment in order to commit larceny and that he murdered her when she returned to her home and found him there. Defendant claimed that he was twice put in jeopardy for the same offense because he was convicted of both murder and murder committed during a burglary in the first degree. He also claimed that the evidence was not sufficient to support the verdict and that the trial judge erred in admitting certain statements that defendant made during custodial interrogations after he requested counsel. The court held that the murder conviction was improper but upheld the conviction for murder committed during a burglary in the first degree. The court ruled that (1) the murder conviction should be vacated because the two offenses arose out of the same alleged conduct; (2) the circumstantial evidence presented and defendant's admissions constituted sufficient evidence; (3) the admission of the statements made by defendant after requesting counsel was harmless error; and (4) the sentencing order was deficient because it did not specify the judge's findings regarding the existence of mitigating and aggravating factors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cause had been remanded to the trial court in order for the prosecutor to come forward with race-neutral explanations for his peremptory strikes of black prospective jurors. On appeal, the court reasoned that while some of the reasons given by the prosecutor were clearly suspect, the prosecutor also gave valid reasons for his strikes of the potential jurors for whom he had given the suspect or subjective reasons. The court concluded that the prosecutor's peremptory challenges were not discriminatory based on the reasons given by the prosecutor for his strike and on the great deference to have been paid to the trial court's findings of fact on this matter. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the trial court had already determined the voluntariness of defendant's statement. The court held that while it was improper for a trial judge to disclose to the jury that he made a preliminary determination that a confession was voluntary, the trial judge made it clear to the jury that they were to ultimately determine whether the confession was voluntary. Therefore, the court held that there was no prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence presented was sufficient to give the case to the jury. The court stated that, based on the facts of the case, the jury's verdict was not palpably contrary to the great weight of the evidence and manifestly wrong. The court found that the circuit court's decision to consolidate the indictments was not an abuse of discretion even though the evidence was stronger against one defendant than the other.

Defendant was arrested for driving under the influence. When an officer first observed him, he was driving on a public highway. By the time the officer turned around and caught up with defendant, he had parked his automobile in a parking area between a convenience store and a car lot.

The court upheld the conviction, finding that the impoundment of the vehicle was reasonable under the circumstances. The vehicle was not parked on property that was controlled by defendant, and there was no showing that the police chose to impound the automobile in order to investigate suspected criminal activity. Nor was there any showing that the police acted in bad faith or for the sole purpose of investigation. The court overruled Morton v. State, 452 So. 2d 1361 (Ala. Crim.

Defendant was sentenced to 90 days in jail, although such sentence was suspended and he was given 12 months to serve on probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's evidence showed that defendant reported to a school's security company that there were eight African-American males in front of the school who were dealing drugs and armed with knives. Defendant was a custodian at the school. When security personnel arrived, there was no one on the premises except for defendant. According to the State, when defendant was asked about the report he said that he called them to report a stolen vacuum cleaner. Defendant allegedly stated that he knew how to get results and that he was tired of waiting several hours for the security personnel to get to the school. Defendant claimed his report was true, but that the individuals had left before the security personnel arrived. The court determined that defendant was improperly convicted under &sect; 13A-11-11 because such statute was inapplicable to the facts. The court noted that defendant's report did not lead to the evacuation of a vehicle or a building. Additionally, the public was not inconvenienced as a result of defendant's conduct.

The court stated that the grounds were race-neutral and defendant was not denied a fair and impartial jury. The court stated that the trial court gave the requisite inquiry before denying defendant youthful offender status, certain witness statements and other prosecutorial work product were not discoverable, and pictures of the victim's autopsy were admissible. The court ruled that the State was entitled to ask jurors how defendant's age would impact their likelihood to recommend the death penalty. The court held that the evidence was sufficient, alleged prosecutorial misconduct did not deny defendant due process, and defendant was not so prejudiced by pretrial publicity to warrant a change of venue.

The court held, in part, that the pretrial identification procedures were not impermissibly suggestive, that photographs showing the victim's wounds were admissible at both the guilt and punishment stages of the trial, and that defendant's failure to object to alleged improper comments by the state during closing arguments weighed against any claim of prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's parents had paramedics and police to go to their son's home because they were concerned that he was critically ill or suicidal.

Police asked defendant to consent to a search, which he did. He later challenged the search claiming that he was under the influence and could not have given valid consent. The court held that drug intoxication could not be allowed to vitiate defendant's consent or the voluntariness of his actions; as long as the consent was not coerced, it was voluntary. In addition, as the police had every valid reason to be in the house, the evidence was admissible under the &quot;plain view&quot; doctrine. The court rejected defendant's claim that his religious beliefs required him to possess the drugs. The court held that the indictment was lawful even if based on evidence from an illegal search because the exclusionary rule did not apply to grand juries.

Defendant asserted that the arrest on the two year old warrant was pretextual and the statement that was made thereafter was improper. The court affirmed the conviction and determined that: (1) the police did not have probable cause to arrest defendant for the murder; (2) the police did have authority to arrest him for the outstanding municipal court warrant; and (3) the determination of whether the arrest was pretextual was on the objective standard, therefore, since the police did no more than they were authorized to do in taking defendant into custody and thereafter inquiring whether he would be willing to talk, this did not constitute a pretextual arrest.</SPAN></P>

The State used three peremptory strikes on the basis that one juror was unemployed, another was the wife of a minister, and a third had an earring and was hostile towards prosecutorial questioning. The court stated that the grounds were race-neutral, and defendant was not denied a fair and impartial jury. The court stated the trial court gave the requisite inquiry before denying defendant youthful offender status, certain witness statements and other prosecutorial work product were not discoverable, and pictures of the victim's autopsy were admissible. The court ruled the State was entitled to ask jurors how defendant's age would impact their likelihood to recommend the death penalty. The court further held the evidence was sufficient, alleged prosecutorial misconduct did not deny defendant due process, and defendant was not so prejudiced by pretrial publicity as to warrant a change of venue.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant presented six issues for review. The court first rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in denying his Batson motion because the State's reasons for striking some jurors was race neutral. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in admitting a photograph of him into evidence. The court found that the photograph was not admitted into evidence and thus, there was no adverse ruling from which defendant could appeal. The court also held that the trial court did not err in consolidating the two offenses for trial because defendant did not preserve the issue for review. Additionally, the court rejected the contention that the State did not prove the proper chain of custody for two exhibits. The court found that defendant had failed to give specific grounds for objections at the time the evidence was offered. The court also ruled that defendant's motion for acquittal was properly denied because the State presented sufficient evidence to support defendant's convictions. Finally, the court held that defendant properly received sentencing enhancements Under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-250 (1975) due to the fact that the crimes took place near a school.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted her of the sale of a controlled substance, marijuana, under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-211 (1975). She was sentenced to seven years in a penitentiary, with two years suspended. Five years of the sentence represented a mandatory enhancement pursuant to Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's double jeopardy argument, which was based on her previous plea of guilty to the possession of the same marijuana, was rejected because defendant did not timely object to the indictment when it was read by the trial court. Even a constitutional issue was not reviewable if it was not properly raised at trial. Defendant also challenged the constitutionality of the enhancement statute, arguing that it did not require that the offender know that he was within three miles of a school at the time of a sale of a controlled substance. The court found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Additionally, the location of the sale, defendant's home, was located within blocks of two different schools. Section 13A-12-250 did not require the State to notify defendant of its intent to invoke the statute, and the record showed that defendant was apprised early in the proceedings that the State would seek enhancement pursuant to the statute if defendant was convicted for the sale of marijuana. The court noted that there was no requirement that the fact that the sale took place within three miles of a school be alleged in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating &sect; 32-5A-191(a)(2) relating to driving under the influence.

She was convicted and sought review, arguing that the UTTC charged that she &quot;did drive&quot; or was &quot;in actual physical control&quot; of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, claiming that the term &quot;drive&quot; and &quot;being in actual control&quot; were not synonymous. The court rejected that argument, noting that its previous holdings had upheld the validity of the UTTC. The court noted that the indictment charged her in language that clearly tracked the words of the statute and was not vague or indefinite. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the bill that was codified at Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-191 violated the requirement of Ala.

Code 1975, &sect; 13A-12-250. He argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because the term &quot;sale&quot; was not adequately defined. The court noted that it had previously held that a defendant could be sentenced under the provisions of &sect; 13A-12-250, even though that section was not alleged in the indictment. The court did not need to define the parameters of the conduct embraced within the term &quot;sale&quot; as used in the schoolyard sentence enhancement statute because the evidence showed that defendant accepted $ 40 from an undercover law enforcement officer in exchange for .130 grams of crack cocaine. A &quot;sale&quot; was commonly understood as a transfer of property for money. Words used in a statute had to be given their natural, plain, ordinary, and commonly understood meaning. Furthermore, Rule 26.6(b)(2), A.R.Crim.P. (Alabama) provided, in part, that at a sentencing hearing, any evidence that had probative value could be received, regardless of its admissibility under the rules of evidence. Evidence regarding the distance of two schools in relation to site of the sale was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 12-21-203 only prevented defendant from impeaching the victim's credibility by showing evidence of sexual history but did not prevent defendant from impeaching the victim through other character witnesses who could testify that the victim's general reputation for truth and veracity was bad; thus, defendant's rights were not violated by the statute. Defendant also claimed that a statements defendant made after requesting counsel during an interrogation were improperly admitted. The court found that inconsistencies in defendant's statements during interrogation and thereafter raised questions of credibility, not admissibility.

Defendant argued that the juvenile court erred by concluding that a juvenile did not have the rights of confrontation and cross-examination at a transfer hearing and that extrajudicial statements were thus admissible.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was allegedly involved in an altercation and then sought revenge by firebombing the apartment of his opponent.

The juvenile court ruled that hearsay was admissible in a transfer proceeding, that defendant had no right of confrontation and cross-examination, that defendant's statement was voluntary, and that the statement was obtained in conformity with Ala. R. Juv. P. 11. The court reversed and ordered a new hearing, holding that juveniles had the rights of confrontation and cross-examination in a transfer hearing by virtue of Ala. R. Juv. P. 11(H), and extrajudicial statements that violated the right of confrontation were inadmissible at a juvenile transfer hearing by virtue of Ala. Code &sect; 12-15-66(b) (1975).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that his due process rights were violated because the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutionally vague in that it did not require a specific mental state to complete the offense. In affirming the conviction, the court held that the offense proscribed by Ala. Code &sect; 13A-11-63 (1975) was one of strict liability. It was undisputed that the shotgun possessed by defendant had a shorter barrel and overall length than permitted by statute. A statute was not constitutionally vague where, measured by common understanding and practices, its language conveyed a definite warning as to the proscribed conduct. The statute required no specific mental culpability on the offender's part; therefore, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-2-3 (1975) provided that the crime was complete when the offender intentionally committed the prohibited act of possession. Because knowledge of the law was presumed, it was irrelevant whether defendant knew that the possession of a short-barreled shotgun constituted a crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and read his Miranda rights after police found the victims body in the back of the victim's car. Defendant stated that a drug deal had gone bad and that drug dealers shot the victim, and told him to dispose of the body. There was testimony from witnesses that defendant stated someone owed him a car, and that defendant's fingerprints were found in the victim's home. Evidence was also presented that defendant wrote out a confession while he was in jail and that a cellmate gave the confession to the police, without the cellmate testifying at trial. The court affirmed. The court held that defendant's Miranda rights were not violated because the atmosphere was different when there was a confession to a cellmate rather than with police. Further, defendant was not denied his right to confrontation because the written confession was neither a verbal statement nor hearsay, nor highly suspect. The court determined the jury charge as to reasonable doubt was proper. The court concluded that the Alabama death penalty statute allowed a trial judge to override the jury recommendation if the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder committed during a robbery in the first degree. Defendant was sentenced to death. On appeal, and after a remand for an evidentiary hearing, the court affirmed. Contrary to defendant's contention of a denial of due process resulting from the state's failure to disclose an alleged agreement the state had with a key prosecution witness regarding his testimony at trial, the trial court found on the remand that there was no agreement with the witness regarding his testimony at trial. The witness did receive reward money, but there was no evidence that the state ever discussed the possibility of a reward with the witness. The court rejected the contention that the witness testified falsely at trial. The court found that defense counsel had been informed prior to trial of the state's plea-related agreement with another witness. The court rejected the contention that the testimony of the other witness was false or misleading. The court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting defendant's cross-examination of a state's witness. The court found that the questions sought to elicit collateral and irrelevant matters.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that defendant did not have a constitutional right to a plea agreement. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial based on the State's improper questioning of an informant because there was a prima facie presumption against error when the trial judge immediately charged the jury to disregard improper remarks or answers. Although the State could not argue based on facts not in evidence, it properly alluded to prior drug dealings by defendant because it could draw proper inferences from evidence. Defendant's proposed jury charge on the bias of informants was properly refused because it was misleading. Further, the proposed charges on intoxication, entrapment, and lesser included offenses were not supported by evidence. The enhancement provision of &sect; 13A-12-250 was properly applied even though the transactions took place at night because the statute intended to create an around-the-clock drug-free atmosphere.</SPAN></P>

Defendants challenged the sufficiency of the evidence and the constitutionality of the rules and regulations. Testimony showed that defendants were fishing in a tidal river north of a bridge that the Department considered the line of demarcation for fresh and salt water. The State presented no rule or regulation defining the line of demarcation, and there were no signs along the river indicating the line. Defendants contended that the rule failed to set forth an ascertainable standard or a notice of prohibited conduct. Although the court questioned the constitutionality of Rule 220-2-.46, it did not answer the issue. Instead, the court found that the State failed to prove an essential element of the violation that defendants, as a matter of fact, were fishing in fresh water. There was no specific testimony that a rule or regulation existed to define fresh and salt water. The fact that there was a practice or custom for the Department to treat water north of the bridge as fresh water was insignificant as a matter of proof of the required element.</SPAN></P>

The prior acts occurred so near the time of the present offense, in the same place, with the same parties, and under the same circumstances that they were relevant to whether defendant possessed the drugs for her own use or for sale.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder after he and three accomplices robbed a store. Defendant's accomplice identified him as a suspect. A witness placed a man who looked very similar to defendant at the scene of the crime and this suspect was initially charged with the crime. The court affirmed the trial court's decision denying defendant's petition for writ of error coram nobis and affirmed his convictions. The court determined that the state did not suppress evidence because defendant's counsel was aware that the other suspect had initially been charged with the crime. The substance of the witness' testimony was reportedly extensively prior to the trial. There was nothing in her testimony that would have, to a reasonable probability, changed the result of defendant's trial. The performance of defendant's counsel was within the wide range of reasonable professional conduct. Defendant's counsel used the ballistics' evidence pertaining to the other suspect's pistol to impeach the state's ballistic expert at trial. Furthermore, counsel's failure to further investigate the other suspect's involvement was the result of a strategic decision by counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment from the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which denied defendant's four consolidated petitions for relief under Ala.

Defendant was collaterally challenging his 1981 rape conviction, which had been affirmed, and each of his three prior felony convictions, which were used to enhance his sentence for the rape conviction as a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant collaterally challenged his rape conviction, which had been affirmed, and each of his three prior adult felony convictions, which were used to enhance his sentence. Defendant was under the age of 18 at the time of his prior convictions. He asserted that were it not for his male gender he would have been adjudicated as a juvenile, and thus, his rape conviction could not have been enhanced to life in prison. He asserted a denial of equal protection because Ala. Code tit. 63, &sect; 311 (1940), defined juvenile status at different ages depending on sex. The trial court denied the relief. On appeal, the court held that the statute was unconstitutional because it denied equal protection and that defense counsel's performance during the prior cases was deficient because of counsel's failure to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. The court noted that it was unable to determine whether he was prejudiced by the deficient performance; therefore, the court remanded the case to the trial court for a determination of whether he would have been adjudicated as a juvenile or as an adult based on the information then available to the juvenile court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed a man who was stopped along a highway. Defendant was convicted of intentional murder during the course of a robbery, and the jury recommended that he be sentenced to death. The trial court sentenced defendant to death by electrocution, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction, finding that he received a fair trial. Defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial, because he was largely responsible for the 22-month delay between the date of defendant's arrest and his trial. Defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied, because he lacked standing to challenge the search of the purse in which the weapon was found. The trial court's instructions to the jury were not erroneous. The record reflected that defendant's sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. The trial court correctly found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. After an independent weighing, the court was convinced that defendant's sentence of death was appropriate and was not disproportionate or excessive to the penalties imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

Acts 634, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to 10 days hard labor, which was suspended for 12 months upon the conditions that he require his tenants to vacate and that he stop advertising his property for rent. Defendant argued that the complaint failed to state an offense because it did not allege that the County Building Commissioner gave him the written notice required by 1951 Ala. Acts 634, &sect; 2. Defendant also claimed that the prosecution did not present a prima facie case because it presented no evidence that the required written notice was given. On review the court rejected both arguments, construing that portion of the act to be a proviso that did not need to be pleaded or proved, but which was a matter of defense. The court noted that the burden was on defendant to establish and bring himself within any exclusion that was found not in the enacting clause defining a crime, but rather in a subsequent clause or statute. The prosecution was not required to allege or prove compliance with the notice provision, and any procedural error was without injury because defendant received actual notice, both oral and written, of the zoning laws from a zoning inspector.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of St. Clair County (Alabama), which summarily dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus on a motion by the State for judgment on the pleadings. He alleged that the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles illegally and unconstitutionally applied &sect; 15-22-27.1, Code of Alabama 1975, to bar his parole and to place him in close custody for 90 days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate had pleaded guilty to the offense of murder. The Board applied &sect; 15-22-27.1 and barred his parole based on a previous felony conviction for attempted murder by the inmate when he was 14 years old. The statute required a previous conviction of a felony or an attempted felony resulting in serious physical injury to another. Remanding the cause, the court instructed the trial court to determine whether the victim in the previous felony suffered serious physical injury as a result of the attempted murder. The court noted that the Board was not required to specify the particular evidence upon which it relied for the discretionary determination. The Board's stated evidence and reasons, however, were not shown by the record to meet the statutory mandate that the previous felony resulted in serious physical injury to another, and the inmate had challenged the Board's decision on that ground. The court discussed the distinctions between parole release and parole revocation and concluded that the inmate did not have a constitutional due process right to parole release. However, a statute satisfying due process requirements could create a protectable expectation of parole.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the cause to the trial court for a determination as to whether the victim of the previous felony suffered serious physical injury as a result of the prior attempted murder committed by the inmate.

The court determined that in order to prove the crime charged, the State was required to show that defendant knew that he was dealing with hazardous waste. The EPA's order, which informed defendant that the substances were hazardous, showed that defendant had the necessary scienter for the intentional or knowing aspects of the crime. Defendant argued that the State failed to charge defendant within the applicable statute of limitations period.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted them both of capital murder for a death that occurred during the course of a burglary, in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(4). Defendant one was also convicted of committing murder while he was under a sentence of life imprisonment, in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(6).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record indicated that defendants broke into their alleged victims' home in the early morning hours while they were sleeping. Each of them fired a gunshot, one of which struck and killed a victim. On appeal, they argued that they were denied a fair trial because of the consolidation. Defendants filed a joint motion for consolidation of their capital cases. They were clearly informed of the possible repercussions. They were properly joined pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 15.4(a). They were estopped from asserting error on appeal, because they invited the error they complained of. The court, however, reversed the convictions because it concluded that it was error to admit evidence of a flight. When the chase occurred, no warrants had been issued against defendants for the murder that occurred two months prior, nor had any concrete evidence been uncovered by the authorities to promote their apprehension in connection with this offense. Therefore, defendants clearly could have had no knowledge that they were wanted for this offense, so as to have precipitated the flight.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the Morgan Circuit Court( Alabama), appellants were convicted of capital murder during the course of a robbery and were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The victim had obtained marijuana from a person who bought it from appellants but the victim had not paid. The seller left his house with the victim and appellants stabbed the victim and took the money he had brought. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Rejecting the argument that equal protection rights were violated because appellants were tried together and each received only nine strikes and the prosecution received 19, the court ruled that the change in the number of strikes under Ala. Temp. R. Crim. P. 15.4(h) was procedural rather than a matter of substance. The court ruled that the trial court properly denied a motion for a mistrial after an officer testified that one appellant had been under surveillance before the killing. The trial court told the jury to disregard the statement and asked whether any juror was not able to do so. One appellant argued that he was improperly convicted because Ala. Code &sect; 12-21-222 (1975) provided that a felony conviction was not possible on the testimony of an accomplice unless corroborated, contending that the seller, who testified, was an accomplice. The court ruled that the trial court correctly submitted the issue as to whether he was an accomplice to the jury. The court noted that the seller refused to help drag the body and did not participate in the murder. The seller testified that he thought he was taking the victim to buy marijuana. The court rejected appellants' other arguments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Talladega County (Alabama), which convicted defendant of the capital offenses of murder for hire, in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(7), and murder committed during a robbery in the first degree, in violation of Ala. Code. &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2), and sentenced her to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of the capital offenses of murder for hire and murder committed during a robbery in the first degree. She was sentenced to death. On appeal, defendant raised numerous errors, including that the trial court erred by denying her motion for a new trial based upon the assertion that the state had used perjured testimony to obtain her conviction. Defendant also claimed that she was denied her constitutional right to counsel when her attorney was incarcerated for contempt. She also argued that the trial court incorrectly instructed the jury and improperly considered a victim impact statement during sentencing. The court rejected most of the arguments, but remanded the case with instructions to resentence defendant without considering the victim impact statement and to issue new written findings because the court was reluctant to presume that the trial court disregarded the statement. The court also concluded that defendant was sufficiently involved in the killing to constitutionally authorize the application of the death penalty even though she was an accomplice non-triggerman.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for murder for hire and murder committed during a robbery in the first degree.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review from the Houston Circuit Court (Alabama), in which he was convicted of unlawful possession of a controlled substance, cocaine, in violation of &sect; 13A-12-212, Code of Alabama 1975. He was sentenced to a term of five years imprisonment, fined, and ordered to pay money to the Crime Victims' Compensation Fund and costs of court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended it was reversible error to exclude him and his counsel from the qualification of the jury. Specifically, he argued that to deny him or his attorney access to the initial qualification of the jury venire violated his due process right as well as his right to counsel. The court found the trial court properly denied the motion for continuance based on the absence of defendant and his counsel from the proceeding. The record did not support the claim that he and his counsel were affirmatively excluded by the trial court from the preliminary jury qualification. Defendant also argued that &sect; 13A-12-212, Code of Alabama 1975, was unconstitutionally vague. However, the issue being raised for the first time on appeal was not preserved for review. In comparing the language of the indictment to the language of the statute involved, the court found that the language of the indictment followed that of the statute sufficiently for defendant to be informed of the accusation. It was unnecessary to mention intent in the indictment. The indictment was sufficient to allow defendant to prepare a defense and to protect him against a subsequent prosecution for the same offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for the offense of capital murder and was later convicted of the lesser included offense of intentional murder. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial where, in response to a jury question during their deliberation as to why defendant did not testify, the trial court failed to give defendant's requested charge to the jury on the effect of defendant's failure to testify. Defendant failed to present facts to support his claim that the method of jury selection failed to procure a fair cross-section of the community and therefore he was not entitled to a hearing on the issue. The indictment was valid even though it did not specify the instrument used to strangle the victim. The trial court did not err in opening the court session with a prayer. The trial court did not err in determining that the prosecutor did not exercise his peremptory jury strikes in a racially discriminatory manner. The physical lineup was not unduly suggestive where there was not a great disparity in the physical characteristics of the members of the lineup. Any error in permitting an officer to testify, which defendant contended violated his right of confrontation, was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his murder conviction in favor of the state, contending he was impermissibly placed in double jeopardy when an earlier charge of conspiracy to commit the substantive offense of the murder was dismissed because it was barred by the statute of limitations. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, concluding the murder conviction was not barred by the dismissal of the conspiracy indictment because the state did not have to prove conduct that constituted an offense for which defendant had already been prosecuted in order to prove an essential element of the murder. The court found although it was undisputed that the state relied upon the same evidence for both the conspiracy and murder charge, the phrase &quot;has already been prosecuted&quot; was narrowly interpreted for double jeopardy purposes to mean that defendant had already been convicted or acquitted. The court found that defendant was neither convicted nor acquitted for the purpose of barring a subsequent prosecution because the significant procedural posture that defendant's trial resulted in a dismissal upon his own motion before the actual issues were submitted to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 13A-12-250 was unconstitutional, asserting that it violated both the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. As part of his equal protection argument, defendant maintained that the statute did not treat similarly situated persons in a like manner because a defendant who sold a controlled substance beyond the protected schoolyard area, even one who sold to minors, was not subjected to an enhanced punishment while a defendant who sold a controlled substance within the protected schoolyard area was subjected to enhanced punishment. The court upheld the conviction, concluding that &sect; 13A-12-250 was constitutional. There was no equal protection violation in the fact that the legislature chose to punish the subclass of persons who sold drugs within the protected schoolyard area more severely than the general class of drug traffickers. Defendant was not punished twice for the same offense. The fact that the drug sale was conducted within the specified distance of a schoolyard was an aggravating factor that justified the enhanced sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant them filed a petition for post-conviction relief and the trial court denied it.

On defendant's remaining claim--that he was denied ineffective assistance of counsel--the court determined that defendant failed, both as to trial and as to the original appeal, to show either inadequate or ineffective representation by counsel. The court also determined that the trial court's findings denying relief were not clearly erroneous, and that it had no doubt that the trial court made an independent findings of fact and conclusions of law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested and charged with criminal trespass during a protest at an abortion clinic. Prior to trial, the prosecution filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude defendants from introducing evidence concerning the justification or motive for the trespass, the defense of necessity, defense of third-persons, duress, and mistake of fact and law. The trial court granted the motion. After a jury trial, defendants were found guilty. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions of defendants. The court held that necessity was not a valid defense to the charge of criminal trespass involving abortion clinics because abortion was legal and constitutionally protected. The defense of third-persons was not available to defendants because unlawful physical force, which was necessary to support the defense, was not present. The defense of duress was not available to defendants because it was necessary that the threat of physical harm be unlawful and abortion was not unlawful. Any mistake of fact on part of defendants was not reasonable and therefore properly excluded. There was no mistake of law on part of defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant obtained cocaine at the request of an undercover agent on four different occasions. Defendant asserted the defense of entrapment and argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions and that his sentencing under the schoolyard enhancement provision of &sect; 13A-12-250, Code of Alabama 1975, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that defendant presented insufficient evidence to raise a jury question on the issue of entrapment. Therefore, the burden of proof never shifted to the State to demonstrate defendant's predisposition to commit the offenses charged. Evidence that the agent initiated contact with defendant was insufficient to meet defendant's burden. Defendant told the agent that defendant had a loud car so that people could hear him coming and would buy drugs from him, and defendant testified that he had a cocaine habit. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict. Because defendant failed to raise the constitutionality argument at the trial level, he waived the issue for appellate review, and &sect; 13A-12-250 had been upheld as constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed. The court stated that in order to convict defendant of first degree possession of marijuana, the State had to prove that the green plant material seized from her was, in fact, marijuana. Thus, the court reasoned, the report was &quot;crucial&quot; to the prosecution and &quot;devastating&quot; to defendant in that it alone established an essential element of the offense. The court noted that the prosecutor did not even allege that the toxicologist was unavailable. Under the facts of this particular case, the court found that the utility of confronting the absent toxicologist was not remote and that the report was both &quot;crucial&quot; to the prosecution and &quot;devastating&quot; to defendant. The court held that it was therefore necessary for the prosecution to establish the unavailability of the toxicologist who prepared the report.

Defendant claimed that the statute unconstitutionally violated the Equal Protection Clause because it discriminated against lower socioeconomic classes. She claimed that their status forced them to live in confined urban areas. Due to such confinement and the concentration of population in a small area, schools were necessarily situated in, around, and near those neighborhoods. The court disagreed, finding that case law had held that the predecessor to the statute did not violate the principles of equal protection because there was no showing of a discriminatory purpose.

The maximum period of probation for a misdemeanor was two years, and the provisions were applicable to a person adjudged a youthful offender. The court held that the sentence imposed on defendant exceeded the jurisdiction of the trial court. The State admitted the error. Further, the court found no statute authorizing a trial court to sentence a youthful offender adjudged guilty of a misdemeanor to &quot;boot camp&quot; under the Department of Corrections. Finally, as the sentence was set aside, defendant's argument that Ala. Code &sect; 15-12-25 (1975) was unconstitutional was moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with four counts for sodomizing his stepson: I, child abuse as the result of committing sexual abuse in the first degree; II, child abuse as the result of committing first degree sodomy; III, first degree sexual abuse; and IV, first degree sodomy. Defendant moved for an acquittal claiming that the State failed to make its case on any of the counts. The motion was denied. Defendant moved for acquittal again at the close of the case. The trial court dismissed counts I and II and convicted defendant of count IV, first degree sodomy. Defendant appealed, claiming that counts III and IV should have been dismissed as well because the elements of a prima facie case were the same for all four counts. On appeal, the court affirmed and ruled that because defendant did not object to the trial court's dismissal of the two counts, the issue was not preserved for review. Furthermore, even if the issue was preserved, there was no error. And any error in not dismissing count III was harmless because the jury acquitted defendant of that count. Finally, the court did not err in refusing to dismiss count IV where the State established a prima facie case of first degree sodomy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a judgment of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which declared that Ala Code &sect; 26-10-8 (1975) was constitutionally vague in that it denied defendants due process because it failed to set forth sufficient guidance to those who would be law-abiding or advise a defendant of the nature and cause of an accusation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were separately indicted for advertising that they would adopt children and/or holding out inducements to a parent to part with her infant child in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 26-10-8 (1975). Defendants filed separate motions to dismiss, challenging the constitutionality of the statute. These motions were consolidated and the circuit court determined that the statute was unconstitutionally vague, and therefore, violated defendants' due process rights under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The court held that the statute was so vague, ambiguous, and broad that reasonable people had to guess at its meaning and differ as to is application The court noted that a significant indication that the statute was unconstitutional was found in the fact that &sect; 26-10-8 was repealed by 1990 Ala. Acts 90-554, codified at Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 26-10A-1 to 26-10A-38 (Supp. 1990). The significance was not merely in the fact that Ala. Code &sect; 26-10-8 had been repealed, but in the comparison of the specificity and definiteness of the new provisions with the ambiguity and vagueness of the old. The court expressed no opinion on the constitutionality of the new provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of two counts of rape in the first degree and two counts sexual abuse in the first degree, and he was sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment on the rape counts and was sentenced to two 20-year terms on the sexual abuse counts, all of which were to run concurrently; he appealed. The court vacated and remanded. Defendant could not be convicted of sexual abuse in the first degree and rape in the first degree because sexual abuse in the first degree was a lesser included offense of rape in the first degree. Nor could he constitutionally be convicted of two counts of the same statute. The evidence was clear that only one act took place. Thus, defendant could constitutionally only be convicted of one count instead of the four counts of which he was convicted. Sufficient evidence existed for the issue of forcible compulsion to be presented to the jury. No error was committed in denying defendant's motion for a new trial. The trial court's jury charge was not coercive. The record did not support a conclusion that a violation of a discovery order occurred. Defendant did not prove that the evidence was favorable to him or that it was material.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's convictions and sentences for two counts of rape in the first degree and two counts of sexual abuse in the first degree and remanded the case to the circuit court with instructions that three of defendant's convictions and sentences be vacated and file a return with the court within a period of time not to exceed 90 days. The three convictions and sentences to be vacated shall be determined by the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was separately indicted for the two offenses, but the charges were tried in one consolidated action.

Code &sect; 20-2-79 (1975). The sole issue raised on appeal was the constitutionality of the &quot;schoolyard&quot; enhancement provision of &sect; 20-2-79. Defendant claimed that &sect; 20-20-79 was so overbroad and vague as to render it unconstitutional and that it violated established principles of equal protection. The court disagreed, holding that the overbreadth doctrine, which derived from the First Amendment, did not apply to &sect; 20-2-79 because there were no First Amendment rights at stake. Further, an enhanced punishment was rationally related to the purposes of the school yard statute and did not violate the principles of equal protection. Finally, the court held that defendant waived his claim that &sect; 20-2-79 was an unconstitutional strict liability statute because the claim was not supported by an argument that was based on legal authority.</SPAN></P>

The lower court denied a petition defendant brought under Ala. R. Crim. P. Temp. 20, in which he asserted that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and the court affirmed that decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant kidnapped and killed a female victim after attempting to rape her. Defendant was later arrested and convicted of an unrelated burglary charge. Police noticed that defendant's vehicle had the same tire tracks as found at the murder location. Defendant searched the vehicle, and found evidence of defendant's involvement in the kidnapping and murder of the victim. Defendant was eventually tried and found guilty of capital murder committed during a kidnapping in the first degree in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(1). Defendant appealed his conviction, and the court held that the trial court correctly allowed two jurors to remain, after they admitted knowing the victim's family, because they both stated they could be fair and impartial. The court also stated that defendant was not entitled to a change of venue, since he did not show that adverse publicity may have biased prospective jurors. In addition, the court determined that the search of defendant's vehicle without a warrant was legal, because he abandoned it when he threw the keys away. Finally, the court concluded that the death penalty was properly reached by the jury, and was in proportion to his crime.</SPAN></P>

At issue was the application of Ala. Code 1975, &sect; 20-2-81 to defendant's request for a reduced or suspended sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of trafficking in cannabis, he was given a suspended sentence, and the State successfully prosecuted a petition for a writ of mandamus. When the circuit court was ordered to set aside its order on the grounds that it had not made an express finding that defendant had rendered substantial assistance, a conference was held by the circuit court, and defendant was sentenced to three years imprisonment. Defendant appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant could have been entitled to a reduced or suspended sentence upon a showing that he rendered substantial assistance to the State in connection with the identification, arrest, or conviction of others connected with the crime pursuant to &sect; 20-2-81. However, all presumptions had to be indulged in favor of the circuit court because the record did not show the evidence or proceedings connected with the conference. Because the circuit court failed to make an express finding that the defendant had rendered substantial assistance, the only presumption available to the court was defendant had not rendered substantial assistance.</SPAN></P>

The record revealed that defendant was represented by counsel prior to trial, had previous experience with criminal proceedings, and had previously represented himself. Prior to questioning the venire, defendant explained his right to self-representation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his capital robbery-murder conviction and death sentence, raising several objections. The court affirmed the conviction and the death sentence, noting that defendant failed to preserve most of the errors for review as required by Ala. R. App. P. 45A, by objecting at trial. Because the case was a death case, the court was required to review the record nonetheless for plain error, but even that review was thwarted because without any evidence in the record on appeal to support the allegations of error, the court could not consider an alleged error. The court further held that nothing in the record showed that any adverse publicity prejudiced the veniremembers against defendant. The court found that defendant failed to show that the news coverage was so extensive as to be presumptively prejudicial and that he failed to demonstrate actual prejudice in the entire venire. The court further held that the jury was properly impaneled and that it was properly instructed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied a motion to suppress based on the theory that Ala.

On appeal, the court found that a motion to suppress was not the proper vehicle to challenge the sufficiency of an indictment, but held that &sect; 20-2-80 had not been repealed but only transferred to another title of the Alabama Criminal Code and renumbered as Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-231. The court held that a miscitation was not a fatal defect in the absence of actual prejudice. The court held that a Batson challenge was not timely made or preserved for review when the issue was raised after the jury was sworn, and the trial court could no longer take corrective action. The court declined to rule on whether Ala. Code &sect; 15-5-9 (1975) was unconstitutional because it authorized the nighttime execution of a search warrant for controlled substances based upon probable cause only, yet required a stricter standard for the nighttime execution of a warrant for other types of property.

Defendant asserted that his counsel failed to discover the identity of an informant and a photographic lineup. He also argued that once his counsel discovered that evidence, he should have timely moved to have the evidence excluded. The court rejected defendant's argument and affirmed. His attorney zealously attempted to keep the photographic lineup excluded and attempted to prove there had been a tainted identification process. The attorney questioned several State's witnesses to ascertain the informant's whereabouts. Even if the attorney had known where to find the informant, he made clear he would not have called the informant to testify because the informant identified defendant by a nickname that defendant admitted was his. The trial judge was entitled to credit the attorney's account of his conversation with defendant regarding sentencing options. Even though defendant's sentence was enhanced by an inapplicable statute, applying the proper statute would have resulted in the same sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action filed by the state, defendant appealed a judgment of the Russell Circuit Court (Alabama) that convicted him of allowing his child under the age of 17 to engage in the production of obscene matter under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-196 (1975), and second-degree sexual abuse under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-6-67 (1975), and that imposed prison sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment stated that defendant made visual reproductions of his 15-year-old daughter and her 14-year-old friend that included breast nudity. Before trial, defendant filed an unsuccessful motion to dismiss, arguing that Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-196 (1975) was unconstitutionally overbroad. The court affirmed the judgment. Defendant's pretrial motion to dismiss was untimely under Ala. Temp. R. Crim. P. 16.3(a) because it was not filed at or prior to his arraignment, and because the trial court never set a date for the motion. In addition, the motion did not raise any issues to preserve for review. The United States Supreme Court's definition of obscenity was incorporated in Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 13A-12-196, -190(13) (1975). These sections were constitutional because they were specific and provided notice. Defendant's argument that the State did not prove that he took the pictures to address his &quot;lustful urges&quot; lacked merit when the daughter identified herself in the pictures, and when she and the friend testified that defendant had let them drink. Consolidating the indictment was proper when the daughter testified that sexual abuse occurred when defendant took the pictures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that convicted defendant of, and that sentenced him for, second-degree sexual abuse and allowing his child under 17 to engage in the production of obscene matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted under Ala.

Subsequent to his conviction, defendant contended that he was denied due process because the indictment, read to the jury, contained a reference to his previous conviction. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that defendant's due process rights were not violated. The prior conviction was an element of the charged offense and the jury was thoroughly instructed to disregard the prior offense when considering the guilt or innocence of defendant. Further, the statute did not, as defendant asserted, unconstitutionally fix a harsher punishment because defendant had been convicted of a similar offense. The sentence was an enhanced penalty for the latest crime, which was considered to have been an aggravated offense because it was a repetitive one. The court cited similar statutes, including the Alabama Habitual Felony Offender Act, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-9 (1975), which had been held constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction from the Escambia Circuit Court (Alabama) for the sale of marijuana within one mile of a school, in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-211 (1975). He was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment in the state penitentiary, with five years of that term to be served without provision for probation, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-79 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A government undercover agent cultivated a relationship with defendant, who managed a bar, telling him that the agent ran across marijuana growing locally in the course of running a gas utility line locating business. Defendant told the agent that such finds were &quot;easy money.&quot; After the agent told defendant he was interested in buying 15 pounds of marijuana for resale, defendant sold him a sample. On defendant's appeal from his conviction, the court held that Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-79 (1975), which added a five-year mandatory sentence for selling drugs within a one-mile radius of an educational institution, was not void for vagueness because it gave men of reasonable intelligence notice that selling drugs was prohibited within a one-mile radius of a school of any kind. The First Amendment's overbreadth doctrine did not apply to a criminal statute such as &sect; 20-2-79 because no protected freedoms, such as speech or association, were impinged. Defense counsel's failure to call certain fact and character witnesses was not ineffective because defendant failed to prove he was prejudiced. The trial court's denial of defendant's motion for new trial was not preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-12-211 (1975). He was sentenced to two seven-year terms in the state penitentiary, to run concurrently, with five years to be served without provision for probation, pursuant to Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold marijuana to an undercover agent on two occasions. Defendant also took money for the sale of cocaine, although he never delivered the drug. In affirming defendant's conviction and sentence, the court held that the indictment for the unlawful sale of drugs did not need to contain any reference to the sentence-enhancing provisions of &sect; 20-2-79 for defendant's sentence to be enhanced under that statute. Further, defendant's youthful offender status petition was not arbitrarily denied. The trial court had ordered an investigation and had denied the petition based on the report of defendant's probation officer, which was sufficient. The testimony of the agent as to the cocaine sale was properly admitted, although it was evidence of an uncharged crime, because it was intimately connected with the transaction that formed the basis of the State's case. The State provided sufficient evidence that the sale occurred within a one-mile radius of a school through the testimony of a chief deputy that the school was on the block adjoining the street where the sale occurred. Finally, defendant failed to raise the constitutionality of &sect; 20-2-79 at trial, thus waiving the issue.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(10). On appeal, the court stated that the medical expert's opinion was based, at least in part, upon hearsay evidence in the form of conversations he had with witnesses to the crime and upon his review of police reports and medical records which were not admitted into evidence. However, his opinion was also based on personal observation and examination. An expert was not prohibited from stating his opinion based upon his own investigation and examination. The court found that the trial court did not commit reversible error in allowing the medical expert to testify to his opinion of defendant's sanity. Further, the court stated that insanity was an affirmative defense which had to be proven by defendant to the reasonable satisfaction of the jury. The presumption of sanity relieved the state of any affirmative duty to prove that defendant was in fact sane and responsible for his actions.

The indictment alleged none of the three specifically statutorily prohibited types of marijuana possession and thereby failed to charge any offense under &sect;&sect; 13A-12-213 or 13A-12-214. The court held that: (1) an indictment merely charging the &quot;possession of marijuana&quot; under the 1987 Drug Crimes Amendments Act was void for vagueness; (2) defendant's demurrer or motion to quash the indictment on the ground that it failed to state an offense under the laws of Alabama should have been granted; (3) the trial court's instructions to the jury, referring to the material elements of an offense under the former Controlled Substances Act, were erroneous; and (4) expert testimony regarding the yield of the marijuana plants found in defendant's possession would have been relevant because it would have tended to make more probable the existence of the inference that the defendant grew 248 plants for other than his own personal use.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that a juror's bias was grounds for reversal. The jury stated that she would believe a law enforcement officer's word over any other person and that she would have a hard time voting her conscience if alcohol was involved. The court rejected defendant's argument finding that defendant had failed to show that the juror had a &quot;fixed opinion&quot; of guilt or innocence within the meaning of Ala.

The court reasoned that the prosecution had showed that the statement was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently given. The facts indicated that defendant came to the police station in his own vehicle and was Mirandized prior to giving the statement. Further, defendant signed a written waiver of his rights.

Code &sect;20-2-80 (1975), for which he received a 20 year prison term and a $ 25,000 fine. On appeal, defendant raised numerous claims, including that the trial court erred in denying his motions for change of venue and to suppress evidence, and that the State failed to prove all elements of the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After police spotted a field of marijuana on land owned by defendant's mother, which was next to defendant's land, they executed a search warrant, confiscating the marijuana in the field and that found in a barn on defendant's land. Rejecting the errors alleged on appeal, the court found that while there was extensive pre-trial publicity about the case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a change of venue because all but one of the articles were fair and objective, and that the voir dire responses showed that the jury would base its decision solely on the evidence and law. The trial court did not err in refusing to suppress the evidence obtained under the search warrant, because under the totality of the circumstances, the affidavit therefor established probable cause, even after striking the portion defendant objected to. Though he did not own the land the marijuana was growing on, defendant's control of it was sufficient find him in constructive possession of the marijuana thereon. Because there was no proof that the State knowingly suppressed evidence favorable to defendant, the claim that his rights to Brady materials were violated failed.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 13A-10-31(a)(2) and 13-8-3(b) (1975). He contended that the trial court erred by denying his motion for a continuance based on an asserted discovery violation and that his sentence to life imprisonment as a habitual offender was illegal and was an equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brought a motion for discovery to the trial court's attention for the first time at trial. The trial court denied his motion for a continuance but ordered immediate discovery. Because the trial court had ruled favorably on the motion when it was brought to its attention and defendant had not demonstrated how proceeding without a continuance had prejudiced him, the trial court had not abused its discretion by denying his motion. As for his life sentence, while he was correct that the offense for which he was incarcerated could not form the basis of an enhancement because it was an element of escape, as a third-time offender, he was subject to a sentence of life imprisonment for the escape charge given his criminal history. While the court raised the issue of preservation relative to an equal protection violation, the court rejected his contention. Transfer of state inmates to a county work-release program, from which defendant had escaped, subjected him to the felony status regardless of the fact that a county inmate's escape would be a misdemeanor because the transfer was a proper exercise of delegated authority where the state program was overcrowded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for fatally shooting a motel clerk during a robbery. Although an eyewitness failed to identify him, under questioning, he admitted to his involvement. On appeal of a death sentence, the court rejected his contention that the indictment upon failed to aver sufficient elements of aggravation to support his conviction of a capital offense. The indictment plainly charged defendant with the use of deadly force in the course of committing a theft and informed defendant of the offense with which he was being charged. Defendant lacked standing to challenge a warrant used to search a trailer in which evidence was found because the trailer belonged to defendant's nephew. There was no evidence that defendant resided in the trailer, customarily visited it, or had legally entered it. Probable cause to arrest defendant was properly based on trustworthy information that police received from Mississippi authorities who were investigating a similar robbery/murder that had occurred earlier the same day. Although defendant's poor upbringing qualified as a mitigating circumstance, the aggravating circumstances outweighed it and justified imposing the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the sexual abuse of his 11-year-old stepson. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that since Ala. Code &sect; 15-3-5(b)(2) was in effect before the limitations period provided in Ala. Code &sect; 15-3-1 had expired, the &quot;no limitation of time&quot; provision of amended Ala. Code &sect; 15-3-5 controlled and the prosecution was not barred by a statute of limitations. The amended &quot;no limitation of time&quot; provisions did not amount to an ex post facto law and did not deprive him of due process. The court held that although first degree sexual abuse required proof that defendant acted with the intent to gratify the sexual desire of himself or of the person contacted, this intent could be inferred by the jury from the act itself. Although the age of the accused was a material element of first degree sexual abuse, the fact that the inference from circumstantial evidence was that defendant was more than 10 years old when he married the victim's mother was sufficient as proof. Defendant's mistrial motion was correctly denied because the victim's answer--that his &quot;little brother stated that the same thing happened&quot; was not subject to a hearsay objection.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-5-46 (1975) did not violate the Alabama constitution; (5) that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied a motion for new trial because there was not any proof that the State knowingly used the perjured testimony, and the newly discovered evidence would not have changed the result of the trial; and (6) that it was harmless error when the trial court failed to charge the jury that a witness was an accomplice.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was indicted for the offense of manslaughter. In granting defendant's motion to quash the indictment, the trial court held that the indictment did not contain an indictable offense. The State appealed under Ala. Code &sect; 12-22-91 to the Alabama Supreme Court, which ordered the case transferred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In quashing the indictment against defendant, the trial court stated that provocation and heat of passion were defenses to the charge of murder. The trial court found that Ala. Code &sect; 13A-6-3 was unenforceable and void. On review, the court disagreed and held that because the indictment followed the language of the statute sufficiently for defendant to be informed of the nature of the accusation made against him, the trial court erred in quashing the indictment. The record showed that the indictment correctly charged and notified defendant of every element of the manslaughter statute. The heat of passion and provocation elements of manslaughter were not defensive matters, but they were elements that mitigated the homicide from the crime of murder to a lesser crime, as explained in the commentary to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-6-3. The elements of heat of passion and provocation were part of the State's burden of proof in showing that a person committed the crime of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

When she entered the trailer, she saw defendant raising his head from the victim's lower body and that both were naked from the waist down. The mother's friend testified that he saw that defendant had the victim's penis in his mouth. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in permitting the 4-year-old victim to testify.The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that defendant had the full opportunity to cross-examine the victim and that defense counsel did in fact cross-examine the victim and pointed out several inconsistencies in the victim's testimony. As such, defendant was not denied his right of confrontation nor due process. The court also found that the trial judge, the prosecutor, and defense counsel all questioned the victim regarding his competency to testify, and the trial judge found the victim qualified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of violating Gulf Shores, Ala., Ordinance No. 361, the anti noise ordinance, because nearby residences complained about the music coming from the Margaritaville, a Gulf Shores nightclub. The court reversed and rendered a judgment of acquittal. The court held that cities could not, under the guise of the police power, impose restrictions that were unnecessary and unreasonable upon the use of private property or the pursuit of useful activities. The court reasoned that the ordinance sought to ban any sound or vibration, emanating from a commercial establishment, that was audible or perceptible in any residential district at any time. While there could be no doubt that the peace and tranquility of one's home was an important interest, deserving protection, it was essential that such protection be narrowly drawn and applied so as to minimize its infringement on U.S. Const. amend. I freedoms. The court concluded that the ordinance, while addressing a matter well within the city's police power, was drafted too broadly to be upheld.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that because he was convicted of manslaughter involving the use of a rifle and was sentenced to 10 years, the maximum allowed for manslaughter, which the circuit court indicated was mandatory under the enhancement statute,&nbsp;Ala.

In remanding for resentencing, the court held that considering the circuit court's oral charge to the jury, it was clear that the jury found that defendant acted recklessly in causing the victim's death. Therefore, defendant was improperly sentenced for an underlying felony that was committed without the intentional use of a deadly weapon, which did not fall within the category of convictions that invoked the enhancement provision of &sect; 13A-5-6(a)(5). The court further found that defendant sufficiently preserved the matter for the court's review. To allow defendant to be sentenced under the circuit court's belief that he had to impose a 10-year sentence violated defendant's right to due process and, thus, defendant's objection that his sentence was unconstitutional was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that attempted possession of a controlled substance, according to Ala.

Code &sect; 20-2-70, which prohibited possession of a controlled substance, and transferred it to Title 13A, the legislature no longer intended for Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-162 to apply. Section 20-6-162 provided that an attempt to commit a controlled substance crime was punished the same as the controlled substance crime attempted. In affirming, the court found that the case turned on the question of whether to apply the general criminal attempt statute as set out in Ala. Code &sect; 13A-4-2 or to apply the attempt statute for the specific crime charged. The court found that a statute making it a crime to attempt to commit an offense was intended to be of a general nature punishing all attempts to commit any crime and only applied where there was no other specific provision of law punishing such attempt. Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-162 punished the attempt and the substantive crime as the same class of felony. The court concluded that it was not an unconstitutional scheme of punishment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's friend allegedly strangled defendant's ex-girlfriend at his instigation. A murder for hire charge was dismissed. Prior to his retrial for the capital offense, defendant filed a plea of double jeopardy, claiming for the first time that his prosecution for capital murder-robbery was barred by his prior conviction for theft. The plea was denied. Defendant argued that his prosecution for the capital offense involving the felony murder of his ex-girlfriend violated double jeopardy principles and was barred by his prior conviction for the theft of ex-girlfriend's automobile. The court agreed and reversed the judgment, holding that the State could not prosecute defendant for a lower-grade offense and then put him on trial for a higher grade of the same offense. The court concluded that the theft of various items of the ex-girlfriend's property constituted one offense of robbery that was a lesser-included offense of the charged capital offense of robbery-murder. The court held that an accused convicted of a lesser-included offense could not be prosecuted for the greater offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant challenged the trial court's failure to grant his motion for a new trial. The court found that the validity of prosecutor's reasons for striking two black venire persons because they had had traffic citations did not &quot;stand up under close scrutiny&quot; when the record revealed that two white jurors who served on jury had similar traffic offenses. The court ruled that the trial court's failure to grant the motion for new trial was in error. The State exercised its peremptory challenges in violation of Batson, and defendant was entitled to a new trial. Because the validity of defendant's arrest was likely to be an issue upon a retrial, the court considered the question. Defendant argued that he was illegally arrested, and, therefore, that evidence of his flight should not have been submitted to the jury, and that his confession and clothes should not have been admitted into evidence. The court ruled that his arrest was based on probable cause and was lawful. His subsequent statements, the seizure of his clothing, and the fact of his flight were properly admitted into evidence. The detention and questioning of defendant was justified under Terry.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 15-25-2, permitting videotaped depositions and closed-circuit television transmission of testimony of victims and witnesses in child sexual abuse cases, was not repugnant to the confrontation clauses and due process clauses of the United States and Alabama constitutions. The court found that the principal functions of the confrontation clause were preserved by the statute. The statute reflected legislative recognition of a compelling and legitimate state interest in protecting children in sexual abuse cases from the traumatic experience of testifying in open court. The statute also protected defendant's fundamental rights and provided the least restrictive means of carrying out the legitimate state interest involved.

The trial court's findings and conclusions in reference to the two aggravating circumstances were detailed, thorough, and strongly supported by the evidence. However, in reaffirming its opinion, the court modified it to exclude the testimony of defendant's daughter regarding her incestuous relationship with her father that was used to negate defendant's contention that he had no significant history of prior criminal activity based on the State's argument that only convictions could be so used.</SPAN></P>

The state had not withheld exculpatory material when it returned to defendant materials he left in the municipal court at the circuit court. Defendant had notice of the offense charged and testified to his lack of intent. The verdict was supported by the evidence, and conflicts in testimony were resolved by the jury. Under the balancing test, defendant's speedy trial right was not violated even though execution of the warrant was delayed 14 months. The Uniform Commercial Code did not provide a defense because defendant was prosecuted for a crime, not to collect a debt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment that convicted defendant of issuing a worthless instrument, fined him, and ordered him to pay restitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's contention that a statement that he gave to a police dispatcher while he was in the hospital should have been inadmissible absent a showing that he was advised of his Miranda rights. The police dispatcher was not a law enforcement officer, called as a friend, and charged the call to her personal telephone. This was not the custodial interrogation that was envisioned in the Miranda decision. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court's instructions to the jury that &quot;every person over the age of 14 is presumed by the law to be responsible for his acts&quot; was improper as a violation of due process. The trial court's entire charge addressed the law concerning defendant's insanity defense, and the language in question, that &quot;every person over 14 years of age is presumed by the law to be responsible for his acts,&quot; followed the language of Ala. Code &sect; 15-16-2, which had previously been held constitutional. The trial court properly declined to charge the jury on duress or compulsion because the evidence did not warrant it. The trial court's instructions on theft of a gun and self-defense were correct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Etowah County (Alabama), which convicted him of issuing a worthless instrument, in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-9-13.1 (1975). He was originally found guilty and sentenced on this charge by the district court. Defendant appealed to the circuit court where he was found guilty as charged by a jury. The circuit court reinstated the sentence imposed by the district court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complainant testified that he delivered some machines to defendant on a third party's behalf. Defendant made out two checks, payable to the third party. He told the complainant that one of the checks could be cashed immediately and the other was to be held for one week. The third party endorsed one of the checks and gave it to the complainant. The complainant deposited the check. He later received the check from his bank with the notation &quot;account closed.&quot; The complainant sent defendant a notice of dishonor, which was returned as &quot;unclaimed.&quot; The court affirmed defendant's conviction. It rejected his claim that &sect; 13A-9-13.1 was unconstitutional because it allowed imprisonment for debt in violation of Ala. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20 (1901). The difference between the improper use of a statute as a means of punishment for debt and the proper use of a statute as a means of punishment for a criminal act was intent. Section 13A-9-13.1 required that a person deliver a negotiable instrument for a thing of value with the intent, knowledge, or expectation that it would not be honored. Defendant was prosecuted because he violated &sect; 13A-9-13.1 and not for the sole reason of collecting a debt.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the indictment was valid. The court rejected defendant's assertion that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct on the prosecution's burden of proof as requested by defendant. In response to defendant's third argument, the court held that, despite the heinousness of defendant's acts during the commission of the offense, there was no evidence, which established that he was insane. The court also rejected defendant's contention that he should have been sentenced to life without parole rather than death and affirmed both the judgment and sentence below. The trial court did not err in its findings regarding the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The trial court was authorized to reject the jury's recommendation of life without parole when imposing sentence and properly imposed a death sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Montgomery County Circuit Court (Alabama). At trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict for the capital offense of murder wherein two or more persons are murdered by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct. The jury also returned an advisor verdict that recommended the death penalty. The trial court imposed the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not dispute that he killed his three children by cutting their throats. Defendant maintained that he was insane at the time of the murders. The court stated that the jury was entitled to consider the manner in which defendant's experts conducted their interviews of defendant and the lack of underlying data to support the experts' opinions. The court believed that the evidence permitted the jury to find that defendant was sane when he murdered his three children. Defendant also challenged the admissibility of his statement that he cut his kids because he did not want his wife to get them. The court determined that defendant's confession was voluntary. Defendant argued that the evidence did not support the trial court's finding that the capital offense was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel because the children were killed in their sleep. The court thought that the evidence supported the trial court's finding because the medical evidence disclosed that each child slowly bled to death. The court rejected defendant's equal protection challenge because he lacked standing to complain about the exclusion of black jurors when he was a member of the Asian race.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence against the challenges and confirmed the sentence independently because: (1) there was sufficient evidence from the presence of seminal fluid and the testimony that defendant was the only male near the victim at the time of the event to support rape or attempted rape; (2) the statements were voluntary and encouragement by police that defendant should tell his story were not coercive or deceptive; (3) Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Attorney General for the State of Alabama, filed an original petition for writ of mandamus, seeking to compel the Circuit Court of Tuscaloosa County (Alabama) to set aside its order granting probation to defendant, who was convicted of trafficking in marijuana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Attorney General argued that a sentencing judge was not authorized to grant a person convicted of trafficking in cannabis under Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-80(1)(a), a reduced sentenced or probation under Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-81(b) absent an appropriate motion by the District Attorney. The court rejected the Attorney General's argument. When a defendant had been convicted of trafficking in drugs under Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-80, the sentencing court could only grant probation or reduction of the three-year minimum mandatory sentence where the state's attorney had filed a motion requesting such reduction or suspension. Where a defendant had rendered substantial assistance in the identification, arrest, or conviction of any of his accomplices pursuant to an agreement with the prosecuting attorney, and the prosecuting attorney failed to move the sentencing court for reduction or suspension of sentence, defendant could seek to have Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-81 declared unconstitutional as it applied in his particular case. In this case, probation was improperly granted because the sentencing judge did not make an express finding that defendant had rendered substantial assistance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition and ordered the trial court to set aside its order granting probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of capital murder and robbery and his convictions were affirmed on direct appeal. Subsequently, he petitioned for a writ of coram nobis. The circuit court denied the petition, ruling that a Batson claim and claims regarding jury instructions on lesser-included offenses were barred because they were not raised at trial or on direct appeal, a complaint about the propriety of the death sentence was barred because it was raised and rejected on direct appeal, and trial counsel was not shown to be ineffective. Petitioner appealed. In affirming, the appellate court ruled that arguments for lesser-included jury instructions were based on conjecture and speculation. The Batson claim could not be raised because the Batson rule was announced after petitioner's conviction was upheld and the rule did not apply retroactively. Issues decided on direct appeal were barred because coram nobis did not lie to relitigate claims. Statistical evidence was not sufficient for petitioner to show racial discrimination in the imposition of the death penalty. Also, the record supported the circuit court's findings with respect to the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the first trial resulted in a mistrial because of a hung jury, defendant was convicted for 28 counts of theft of property. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison and ordered to make restitution in the amount of $ 261,441. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 28 farmers whose testimony supported the 28 counts each took their crop of soybeans to defendant's business but were not paid. When defendant and his business declared bankruptcy, the farmers filed claims and a separate civil action. Defendant claimed that the reason for his financial trouble were, among other things, that the bank had reduced his line of credit and his inability to make margin calls caused his position on the soybean futures market to be liquidated. Defendant claimed that he never intended to deprive any of the farmers of their money or property and that he intended to pay the farmers. The court held that: (1) there was some evidence that the criminal charges were brought to force defendant to pay the farmers the money he owed them; (2) failure to allow defendant to present certain evidence, especially evidence concerning his finances, bank dealings, and soybean futures trading, which would have been relevant to show intent, was reversible error; and (3) because the factual issues were closely entwined with the issue of felonious intent, defendant should have been allowed to put into evidence any material facts that would have tended to disprove intent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the matter for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Convicted murderer sought review of a death sentence that had been imposed by the Lee County Circuit Court (Alabama) pursuant to the recommendation of a jury after a sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Convicted murderer sought reversal of a death sentence that was imposed upon the recommendation of a jury after a sentencing hearing. The court rejected each of eight grounds urged for reversal. It was not error to admit testimony of the murder victim's wife in the sentencing phase because the testimony provided a synopsis of the crime. The prosecutor's mention of the victim's family served to rebut a defense argument based on possible sympathy for the murderer's family, and his remarks about aggravating and mitigating factors did not improperly suggest that non-statutory mitigating factors were to be given less weight than statutory mitigating factors, or that the absence of statutory mitigating factors was equivalent to an aggravating factor. The comment in the trial judge's order that the murderer killed to prevent the victim from identifying him was factual and did not reflect improper consideration of non-statutory aggravating circumstances, the findings on aggravating circumstances were supported by substantial evidence, and there was no merit to claims that voir dire questions were improperly restricted, and a challenge for cause was improperly rejected.</SPAN></P>
