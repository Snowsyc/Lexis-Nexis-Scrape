</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, nonprofit corporations and their officers, were granted real estate tax exemptions from respondent Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to the Green Acre Act (act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 54:4-3.63 to -3.71. Appellant township brought suit against respondents, raising five arguments challenging the validity of the tax exemptions. The court affirmed the tax exemption grants. The court held that the act had not violated N.J. Const. art. I, para. 2's prohibition against special tax laws because the limitation of the act to nonprofit organizations was only to insure that individuals or corporations would not use the exemptions for private purposes or economic gain. The court held that N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, para. 2's directive that all taxes be imposed by general law and uniform rules was not violated by the roll-back provision in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-3.69 because &sect; 54:4-3.69 had no effect on the usual standard of valuation for that taxing district. The court also held that the act's reference to I.R.C. &sect; 501(c)(3) had not violated N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7, para. 5's prohibition against the incorporation of provisions of other laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of respondent Commissioner, Department of Environmental Protection to grant real estate tax exemptions to respondents, nonprofit organizations, was affirmed because the statutory limitation to nonprofit organizations who owned natural open space land had not violated state constitutional provisions prohibiting the enactment of special tax laws that benefited a specific class or effecting the uniform valuation of property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:22-18, respondent school board approved a school lunch program. Appellant city failed to appropriate funds for the program, and respondent filed a complaint demanding such funds. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of respondent, and appellant challenged the constitutionality of the statutory procedure by which a capital project was funded in a type I school district under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 18A:22-18 to 20. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment because the citizens of appellant voted to establish the type I school district in the city, thereby voting for the very procedure under attack. In addition, the court ruled that the Local Bond Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:2-1 et seq., was not a sham as it applied to the requirements of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:22-20 because bonds were required to be issued in accordance with law and were required to comply with the requirements of the Local Bond Law, including giving interested persons an opportunity to be heard under N.J.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, which entered a judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the verdict as to defendants' convictions for breaking and entry or entering without breaking with intent to steal narcotics and larceny of narcotics, and entered a conditional discharge of the jury's finding of guilt for possession of controlled dangerous substances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with breaking and entry or entering without breaking with intent to steal narcotics, larceny of narcotics, and possession of controlled dangerous substances, and were convicted on all three counts. Defendants moved for and obtained a judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the verdict as to the first two counts, and regarding count three, a conditional discharge was entered. The state appealed, seeking reinstatement of the convictions on the first two counts or alternatively entry of a conviction of a lesser included offense, and the court reversed. The court held that the trial court was correct in concluding that there was insufficient evidence of any intent by defendants to steal narcotics, and the judgments of conviction for breaking and entry with intent to steal narcotics and larceny of narcotics were properly vacated. However, the court found that as to the lesser included offense of breaking and entry or entry without breaking, there was abundant proof that defendants were guilty as aiders and abettors of that charge, and guilt of the crime was implicit in the jury verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and remanded the matter to the trial court for the entry of judgments of conviction as to both defendants for the lesser-included offense of breaking and entry. The court held that there was abundant proof that defendants were guilty as aiders or abettors of breaking and entry, and guilt was implicit in the jury verdict.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed defendants' convictions, finding that defendants' claim of insufficient evidence without expert proof that the materials violated contemporary community standards and appealed to the prurient interest of the average person was meritless. The court held that local standards applied, that the jury was entitled to draw its own conclusions as to the prurient interest of the average person, and that expert proof concerning those standards was not required in the state's obscenity case. Thus, the state's case was sufficient despite the absence of expert proof. The court further held that the fact that materials had appeal to a sexually deviant group did not preclude their appeal to the prurient interest of the average person applying contemporary community standards.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:170-29(2)(b). The county court found as a fact that defendant interfered with the lawful exercise of police duty by the trooper. Defendant, a passenger in the car, contended that that the investigation of the driver's condition had actually been concluded inasmuch as the trooper had already determined that the driver was not intoxicated. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the findings and conclusions of the county court in adjudging defendant guilty of a violation of &sect; 2A:170-29(2)(b) were supported by credible evidence in the record. The court found that the proofs supported the conclusion that defendant hampered, disturbed, intervened, and intermeddled in the concern of the trooper in the performance of his duties. The trooper was following routine procedures in attempting to interview the driver and it was perfectly reasonable for him to require that he be able to interrogate and observe the driver without any distraction from defendant. The court held that the interference did not have to be physical.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court, which was an equity court, had jurisdiction to enjoin appellant's activity. The court also held that, because appellee's failure to negotiate constituted an unfair labor practice under N.J. Stat.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that while literally, defendant's interpretation of the statutory language was arguable, a literal interpretation of a statute was not to be accepted if it distorted the legislative intent. The court held that the purpose of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:1-1 was to keep uninsured vehicles off the road for the protection of the public who could be injured or damaged by their operation. The court held that defendant's interpretation would have excluded from the legislative blanket of responsibility one who was not an owner, registrant or operator, but who nevertheless was in control of the car and who admitted he caused it to be operated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of an order entered by the trial court (New Jersey), which ordered a casino beach club that was owned by appellant to open to the general public on the same terms as those available to residents of the city, and which further ordered a lottery for membership to the casino, in an action filed by respondent public advocate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city owned a casino beach club that limited its membership to appellant's residents. Respondent public advocate filed an action to require appellant to open the facilities to the general public at large on the same terms as those available to appellant's residents. On appeal, the court reversed the order of the trial court in favor of respondent because the challenged residency classification was reasonable and offended neither the state or federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection of the law. The court noted that the casino was a facility of limited capacity and could accommodate only a very small fraction of the state's citizens. Therefore, the issue was how to determine who should be able to use the casino. The court found that the trial court's solution, which established a lottery to determine membership, disregarded the financial investment by appellant's residents in the creation and maintenance of the casino. The court also found that a restriction, which limited use of certain beach property adjacent to the casino to its members, was not arbitrary or capricious because the property had never been dedicated to public use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court because the limitation that membership in appellant city's casino be limited to appellant's residents did not violate equal protection principles. The court found that the casino was a limited capacity facility and that the trial court's order, which would have established membership through a lottery, ignored the fact that the casino was maintained financially by appellant's residents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant child raised for the first time on review the issue that his birth was legitimized by N.J. Stat.

Although there was no testimony on the issue of whether appellant's parents had a common law marriage in another state, the court assumed that there was such a marriage in order to consider the issue of whether &sect; 2A:34-20 would legitimate appellant. The court found that, under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:15-2 and &sect; 2A:34-20, the ceremonial marriage of appellant's parents, though bigamous, would have been effective to render legitimate any child born subsequent to that ceremony. The reasoned that the common law marriage was sufficient to satisfy the marriage requirement of &sect; 3A:4-7 because the distinction between common law and ceremonial marriages could not alter the liberal construction customarily given to legitimacy statutes. The court held that if such marriage existed, appellant was legitimated even though the marriage was void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Newark, N.J., Rev. Ordinance 2:14-1 required all city officers and employees to reside within the city limits as a condition for appointment and for continued employment. Plaintiff city employees challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance, and the trial court agreed that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV because police and firemen were statutorily exempted from the requirements and the ordinance was selectively enforced. Defendant city appealed the decision and the court held that the Equal Protection Clause did not prohibit mere inequality or difference in treatment. The court held that policemen and firemen and employees exempted from the ordinance by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:9-1 presumptively constituted a class rationally distinguishable from other employees. The court found that the evidence did not support a finding of a policy of non-enforcement of the ordinance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of a divorce judgment, defendant father was ordered to pay child support of $ 350 per week plus $ 100 per week for an educational trust and was ordered not to have a female spend the night at his home while his children were visiting. Defendant appealed the order and contended that the monetary arrangements were improper and that the order regarding an overnight visitor was a violation of his constitutional right to privacy. On appeal, the court affirmed and found that an award of support was within the discretion of the trial judge. The court found that the order was supported by the financial condition of the parties in the record. The court also found that the visitation restriction was an exercise of discretion and was not an abuse thereof. The court found that the conclusion of the trial court in custody matters were entitled to great weight and would not be disturbed on appeal lightly. The court found that the order was not a violation of defendant's privacy rights based on other cases.

On that date, the mayor determined that a riot condition existed and that the condition presented a threat to property within the city. As a result he authorized that legal means be taken to protect property, and expenses were incurred by the police and fire departments in implementing the legal order. The city sought to be reimbursed for these expensed. The court determined that the expenses were recoverable from the county for the duration of the threat to property from the riot or riots. The court held that the city proved reimbursable expenditures of $ 425,511.67. The figure constituted overtime pay of police and fire personnel. Because the statutory action was not a &quot;tort action&quot; within the statute providing for interest on judgment in tort actions, the city was not entitled to interest on the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1A-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff public officials challenged the trial court's order enforcing an executive order issued by defendant governor and authorized by defendant attorney general, requiring high echelon state officials to file financial disclosure statements with the secretary of state for the purpose of public inspection and copying. Plaintiffs were employed, respectively, as a director in the department of education and as an assistant secretary of agriculture. On appeal, the court held that the overlapping provisions of the Right to Know Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1A-1 et seq., and the Conflicts of Interest Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:13d-21, mandated that executive branch records be made available to public inspection. Under the executive power invested in him by N.J. Const. art. V, &sect; 1, par. 1 (1947), defendant governor's order requiring highly-placed state employees to make financial disclosure was not ultra vires. A rational relationship existed between defendant's order and the end to be achieved, openness in government.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After plaintiff professor wrote an article in the college newspaper criticizing defendant school officials, plaintiff's employment was terminated. Plaintiff filed suit alleging a violation of her rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Following a bench trial, the trial court entered judgment in plaintiff's favor, awarding compensatory damages and attorney fees. Defendants appealed, arguing that they were immune from liability. In affirming in part, the court concluded that plaintiff's actions fell within the protection of U.S. Const. amend. I and that no proof had been offered that her activities led to a material disruption or an invasion of others' rights. Where defendants' actions were in retaliation for plaintiff's expression of her opinion, defendants reasonably should have known that they acted to deprive plaintiff of her First Amendment rights. As such, they were afforded no official immunity. In reducing the damages awarded, however, the court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding compensatory damages in excess of plaintiff's proofs. Further, an award of attorney fees was erroneous where 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 did not authorize such an award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants moved for a dismissal of the indictment charging them with conspiracy to rig bids for a construction project, arguing prosecutorial misconduct. Specifically, defendants argued that they based their defense theory and cross-examination of witnesses upon the prosecutor's representations that she intended to call a co-conspirator as a witness. The trial court granted defendants' motion, concluding that the prosecution's representations and the defendants' reliance thereon resulted in the deprivation of a fair and proper trial. The prosecution appealed the judgment of dismissal. In reversing and remanding for a new trial, the court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the indictment in the absence of facts establishing a clear representation by the prosecution that it would produce the witness at trial, notwithstanding the speculation of both defense counsel and the trial court that the prosecution would call the witness. The court rejected defendants' argument that a new trial would implicate double jeopardy concerns, as double jeopardy was not designed to address a situation where a trial judge improperly dismissed pending charges.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the statute involved a proper exercise of the state's police power because it was intended to prevent highway accidents between motor vehicles in the highway and pedestrians who were soliciting a ride. The court concluded that because the measure was directed to a matter of public concern within the domain of the police power, it was not an impermissible infringement upon defendant's right to travel. The court noted that any legislation aimed at the public's welfare was bound to affect individuals in varying degrees. The court rejected defendant's argument that the statute was overbroad. The court reasoned that the legislature had all of the information necessary to determine how to best serve the interests of the public, and that it was not appropriate for the court to interfere with the legislative prerogative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the trial court of impairing the morals of a minor in connection with committing an act of fellatio on an 11 year old boy. Defendant appealed, alleging his conviction must be reversed and the matter remanded for a new trial because no record existed from which he could be given a meaningful appeal, as a fire destroyed the original stenographic notes of the trial. The court affirmed, holding that after reviewing the transcript of the reconstruction proceedings together with the settlement letter of the trial judge, it found that the reconstructed record was clearly adequate for appeal purposes. Although counsel's notes and those of the prosecutor and the trial judge were not comprehensive, the trial was brief and there was agreement as to the crucial issues in the case. Defendant also argued that &quot;fresh complaint&quot; testimony of the victim's mother was error requiring reversal because two weeks had passed from the time of the incident to that of the report made by the mother. However, the court found the time span was not improper given the natural reluctance of a boy of that age to divulge such information to a parent.</SPAN></P>

The invalidation of the ordinance requirement that a reclamation plan be put in place and a performance bond posted was reversed, as was the provision that limited the lowest grade level of quarrying and preservation of lateral support of abutting properties, and the provision calling for a natural buffer, because the court found it was a proper exercise of police powers to protect and preserve public health, safety, and welfare. The invalidation of the ordinance requirement limiting operation hours was affirmed as to the specific hours but reversed as to the gross hourly limitation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner purchased a lot in order to construct a home. Defendant city had a minimum frontage requirement of 50 feet. Plaintiff's lot only had a frontage of 25 feet, so he submitted an application to defendant city for a variance. Defendant board of adjustment denied such application on the grounds that it would impair the intent of the ordinance and would be detrimental to the public good. Plaintiff initiated an action. The trial court reversed defendant board's decision finding that application of the ordinance to plaintiff would create a hardship. On appeal, the court reversed the decision. The trial court's review of defendant board's decision was limited to whether defendant board acted arbitrarily. The trial court improperly reviewed the merits of the action, rather than limiting its review to the arbitrary and capricious standard of review. Plaintiff did not prove that defendant board acted arbitrarily or capriciously, so its decision denying plaintiff's application should have been upheld.</SPAN></P>

The line items were part of a general piece of legislation that was enacted each year and was the vitality of the state budget. The line items did not relate to taxation or exemption therefrom, in that they did not levy tax or provide exemption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a major national retailer, argued on appeal that the complaints were insufficient as a matter of law in that they did not adequately apprise defendant of the charges against it, and that they did not charge a crime because they did not negate the exceptions in the statute; that the State did not carry its burden of proof as no evidence was offered that defendant was not within any exceptions set forth in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:171-5.8; and that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:171-5.8 should be declared unconstitutional because the exception in the statute for works of necessity and charity was unconstitutionally vague. The court, having carefully reviewed each of the arguments, concluded that they were clearly without merit. Defendant also argued in a supplemental brief that the classification of &sect; 2A:171-5.8 was arbitrary and not reasonably related to the legislative goal of the statute, and was thus unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inspector allegedly made threatening remarks to the manager of a licensed tavern at which he was conducting an official inspection. The manager reported the incident to appellee, the state Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control, four months later. Ten months later, appellee confronted appellant about the incident, and three months after that a formal charge was served upon him. A hearing was held two months later, at which appellant was found guilty of having behaved in his official capacity so as to dishonor and discredit appellee and with having engaged in conduct constituting just cause for disciplinary action. On review, appellant claimed the action should have been barred because of an inordinate delay in the institution of proceedings. The appeals court affirmed. The court reasoned that delay did not generally affect the validity of administrative decisions, particularly where no prejudice was shown. The court noted that the clarity, precision, and detail of appellant's testimony on direct examination at the hearing flatly contradicted his claim that recall was difficult. Because there was no showing of prejudice, the administrative determination was unaffected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a police officer, was subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. When he appeared, defendant was informed that he was the subject of an investigation and was asked several questions regarding the matters under investigation.

Defendant refused to answer the questions on the advice of counsel, asserting the privilege against self incrimination. Thereafter, he was removed from the office of policeman. On review, defendant contended the trial court erred in finding that questions put to him were directly related to his employment as a police officer. The appeals court affirmed. The court ruled that the record supported the trial court's findings that the questions put to defendant were upon matters which were directly related to the conduct of his office. Hence, because defendant was specifically granted immunity for his testimony by statute, the trial court properly removed defendant from his position due to his failure to comply with the mandatory requirements of N.J.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was a motion for leave to appeal to the county court from an interlocutory order of the municipal court, which had denied defendant admission to the county Pretrial Intervention Program (PTI). PTI was essentially a diversion mechanism, designed to process defendant in a manner that would have effectively deterred criminal or penal behavior, taking him outside the traditional processes and leaving him without any criminal conviction. Defendant, a New York resident, had been charged with a disorderly persons violation. He was excluded from PTI solely because of his nonresidency. In all other respects defendant was eligible for PTI and would have been acceptable had he been a New Jersey resident. He claimed constitutional equal protection and privileges and immunities violations. The court granted defendant's motion. The fact that PTI was a privilege and not a right did not defeat defendant's equal protection argument. His exclusion was a denial of Equal Protection under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Further, defendant was entitled to the privileges and immunities guaranteed him in New Jersey by the U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, cl. 1. Exclusion denied him those rights.</SPAN></P>

Respondent filed an action to prevent appellants from removing him. Appellants argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it conflicted with their right of personal selection which gave them, as client, the right to appoint counsel of their own choosing. Appellants cited DR 2-110(B)(4), which provided that a lawyer shall withdraw from employment when he is discharged by his client. However, the court found that respondent had not been legally discharged. The trial court then held that county counsel could not be removed from office absent good cause.

On appeal, he argued that the possession of a firearm statute was unconstitutional and deprived him of due process and equal protection of the law in that the legislature created two classifications of home dwellers, those on and off campus, without a valid reason. The court found that the legislature was concerned with the demonstrations and disturbances which frequented educational institutions in the sixties, and the elimination of firearms therefrom had a rational relationship to the prevention of violence and bloodshed. Defendant also contended that the judgment was invalid for failure to state the reasons for the sentences as required by N.J. Ct. R. 3:21-5.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmates brought a class action as representatives of all prisoners incarcerated in the county jails of New Jersey, asserting that their prerogatives to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, their rights to counsel, to due process, and to access to the courts were being unconstitutionally denied. The trial judge dismissed the action against defendant commissioner individually and as commissioner, and dismissed the action against all parties except county officials. On appeal, the court stated that before the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, could be applied to compel the granting of relief by a particular official, there had to be a finding that that official was in fact empowered by law to act. Defendant commissioner was only empowered to bring an action under N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, members of a township board of adjustment and planning board challenged the trial court's decision sustaining the validity of an ordinance requiring full disclosure of assets, liabilities and net worth by designated officials. Appellants claimed that the ordinance violated their right to privacy as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amends. I, IV, V, IX, and XIV. The court disagreed and affirmed the trial court's holding. Although the preparation of the disclosure statement involved a considerable burden in the expenditure of time and effort by appellants, and although the nature of the information requested might be embarrassing or have a chilling effect upon those aspiring to these offices, such objections had no force when compared with the paramount right of the public to an honest and impartial government. The ordinance took precautions to avoid complete intrusion by not opening the disclosures to the public and placing minimum dollar amounts for revelation of some assets, so the intrusion was not broader than necessary to accomplish its goals. The classification was rationally related to the purpose because these officials exercised discretion in their roles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord sought summary dispossession of tenants because of their nonpayment of rental increases. The tenants contended that the rental increases were unconscionable and did not comply with applicable laws and municipal ordinances, and therefore were not permissible under &sect; 2A: 18-61.1(f). It was conceded that the increases were in excess of amounts allowable under rental guidelines set by the Franklin Township Rent Leveling Board but were in accord with the maximum rentals prescribed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The court found that the prescription by HUD was preemptive of the action of the municipal board and that the increased rentals were not unconscionable. The court held that the conclusion was inescapable that HUD's declaration stating that it had expressly preempted the sphere of rent control as to rentals in question and declaring the municipal ordinance inoperative as to that property carried with it the full weight of constitutional authority and succeeded in doing that which it purported to do. The court found that the increases up to the rental minimum established by HUD were lawful in accordance with &sect; 2A: 18-61.1(f).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a federally certified flight instructor, was unable to obtain a fixed base operator's license permitting him to give flight instructions at a New Jersey airport regulated by respondent N.J.

The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the regulation, and convicted defendant of violating the statute. The court reversed and vacated the conviction. The court held that the regulation was unconstitutional because it provided the airport owner with uncontrolled discretion to prevent issuance of a license for any reason or no reason. The court held that the power to determine who shall have the right to engage in an otherwise lawful enterprise could not be validly delegated to a private person where the exercise of such power was uncontrolled by adequate legislative standards.</SPAN></P>

The trial court adjudicated defendant as a juvenile delinquent for possession of a revolver in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:151-41. The trial court had denied defendant's motion to suppress the gun and determined that the pat down and search were valid. Defendant challenged the judgment and the court affirmed. The court held that the radio dispatch was sufficiently detailed enough to give the officer a reasonable suspicion when he encountered defendant. The court further held that the officer conducted only a limited search that was warranted by the necessity of the occasion, and that when such limited frisk revealed an object which felt like a gun, that revelation constituted probable cause for a further search and seizure.

The court stated that the police power had not been exhausted by the delegation of zoning power, and that requiring developers to comply with local zoning regulations and regulations for the protection of resources was proper.

The court found that the general police power authority of the municipality under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:48-2 provided the authority for the regulation of laundromats. The court also noted the presumption of validity granted to municipal ordinances.

Both defendants challenged their convictions and the court affirmed. The court held that the decedent's wife's testimony regarding the statements made by the decedent just prior to his death were properly admitted because the decedent was under the stress of a nervous excitement due to the wound and there was no opportunity for him to deliberate or fabricate. The court further held that the conduct of the prosecutor was improper, but the conduct did not substantially prejudice defendants' right to a fair trial and any harm that might have resulted was completely dissipated by the strongly worded curative instruction given by the trial court. The court determined that the trial court properly instruction the jury fully.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:9A-1 et seq., to the court, which affirmed defendant's order on appeal. The court found that no taking occurred because plaintiff did not utilize the available procedure for determining its land's authorized uses or show that it could not make any practical use of its property. The court further held that the act did not constitute an unjust taking in violation of N.J. Const. art. I, para. 20 because it and the order at issue only absolutely prohibited dumping solid wastes, discharging sewage, and storing or applying pesticides. The court also reasoned that defendant's commissioner could authorize the conduct of regulated activities in coastal wetlands.

Because it subsisted until decedent's death, his subsequent ceremonial marriages were void ab initio. It was not pretended that decedent's relationship with the &quot;third wife&quot; ever achieved the dignity of a marriage. The &quot;first wife&quot; was entitled to one-third of the decedent's net estate.

The guard remained in the cell for about 24 hours. Defendant was convicted of kidnapping, two counts of false imprisonment, and two counts of assault and battery upon uniformed law enforcement officers. On appeal, the court held that evidence that defendant dragged the guard 700 feet was sufficient to demonstrate asportation under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:118-1. The court found that defendant participated in the forcible and unlawful asportation and detention of the guard, who was held hostage during negotiations between inmates and the prison administration. The court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:85-1 was not unconstitutionally vague even though it did not expressly spell out the elements of the crime of false imprisonment, which made it necessary to look to the common law for a precise definition. The court held that the grand jury had jurisdiction to return the indictment.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner was granted a hearing before respondent Commissioner of Community Affairs, where the report was adopted. On appeal, petitioner contended that the statute did not apply to it as a private club, the law was unconstitutional because it did not contain sufficient standards for determining when persons &quot;lived independently&quot; of each other, and the regulations were void because they were without statutory authority. The court affirmed the decision, holding that petitioner was a multiple dwelling as defined by N.J. Stat.

The court held that &sect; 2A:158A-17 did not constitute an invalid encroachment by the legislature upon the New Jersey supreme court's rule-making authority because the matter of providing counsel for indigent defendants in criminal cases, including the allocation and method of payment of costs thereof, was expressly left by the supreme court to the legislature.

The court ruled that &sect; 2A:158A-17 did not chill an indigent's right to counsel because it did not offend equal protection and it was not otherwise unreasonable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that a complaint was insufficient as a matter of law and asserted that the complaint did not adequately apprise defendant of the charges against it and did not charge a crime because it did not negative the exceptions in &sect; 2A: 171-5.8. Defendant also claimed that the exception in the statute for &quot;works of necessity and charity&quot; were unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the state did not have to plead or prove that defendant was within the exception to the Sunday Closing Law for &quot;works of necessity and charity,&quot; because the clause was not part of the description of the offense or prohibitory clause. The burden was on defendant to prove that was within one of the exceptions. Further, the complaint was not defective because the specific violation of a sale of a shirt on Sunday was not included or because the complaint did not allege that the sale did not come within the &quot;works of necessity or charity&quot; exception. The phrase &quot;works of necessity and charity&quot; was also sufficient to avoid the defect of vagueness.

When defendant had shut down the reactor, cold river water was pumped into a creek that was artificially heated by the plant when the reactor was operating. The heated water had attracted fish to the water and the introduction of the cold water killed 500,000 menhaden, a species of fish important to commercial uses.

The court reversed and reinstated defendant's sentence to custodial confinement because the trial court had no authority to depart from the mandatory terms of &sect; 39:3-40. The court rejected defendant's contentions that the statute was inapplicable to him and that its application would be violative of U.S. Const. Amends. VIII and XIV. The court found that the statute had a rational basis in that it was designed to protect the public from unlicensed drivers and applied equally to all persons who came within the scope of &sect; 39:3-40.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant's employment with respondent employer was terminated. Appellant returned home to Puerto Rico where he filed a claim for benefits under New Jersey unemployment compensation laws. Appellant was denied benefits under a state policy that denied unemployment benefits to claimants who moved to an area of persistently high unemployment, on the ground that such claimants had voluntarily reduced their prospects of finding employment by restricting their availability to an extremely limited number of job opportunities. Respondent New Jersey Department of Labor and Industry affirmed the decision and claimant appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that appellant effectively removed himself from the labor market when he returned to his home in Puerto Rico and was, therefore, properly denied benefits. The court found that the unemployment compensation law was not being applied in a discriminatory manner against appellant and all those persons similarly situated who moved to Puerto Rico and, thus, did not violate any constitutional principals, because the policy was applied uniformly to claimants from each of the fifty states, commonwealths, and territories.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance was presumed to be valid, and defendant failed to meet his burden of establishing to the contrary. The court, under a duty to construe the ordinance as to render it constitutional if it was reasonably susceptible to such construction, held that &sect; 15-25(b) was intended to prohibit noises which would disturb the peace and would constitute common law nuisances. The court concluded that the proper construction of &sect; 15-25(b) was that it prohibited loud and unnecessary noises, i.e. those which were unreasonable in the circumstances.

The court concluded that respondent HCAB was not required to pursue formal amendment procedures before it could utilize the current information, which reflected a change in statistical data, for the determination of need. The court affirmed respondent commissioner's decision, which remanded the case for a rehearing based upon the updated statistical data, holding that the certificate of need requirement of N.J. Stat.

Defendant's attorney made a timely objection to the court's charge, contending that the fornication statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:110-1, was unconstitutional in its discriminatory enforcement, that it was violative of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged the judgment of the trial court that sustained the tax rate imposed by respondent county tax board on appellant's tangible business personalty. The court interpreted interim legislation contained in 1964 N.J. Laws 141, which established a tax rate calculation for 1965 and 1966. The law directed the division of taxation to compile a report that indicated property taxes levied and collected for 1963 to be used by respondent to determine personalty tax rates. The court found that appellant's argument, that only the taxes actually collected were to be considered in calculating the tax rate, was not a reasonable interpretation of the statute. The court took notice that tax appeals took many years, and it was not until the conclusion of litigation that the taxes actually collected were known. The statutory scheme did not impute such knowledge to respondent, except through the report of the division of taxation under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-9(d). The court held that to construe the statute as requiring a change in formula in N.J. Stat.

In reaching this conclusion, the court applied the analogous rule that the risk of loss in a property sale is borne by the purchaser. The court found that here, the bargained for price was the fair market value, and that defendant property owner's receipt of the fair market value plus the insurance proceeds would have been excessive; noting that because defendant property owner was completely compensated by the award of fair market value, any extra compensation would be a windfall.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant husband sought review of a judgment of divorce entered by a trial court (New Jersey) against him in an action brought by plaintiff wife in a cause partially based on extreme cruelty as defined in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:34-2. Defendant contended that plaintiff failed to prove a cause under that statute. Also, defendant sought a declaration that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:14B-28 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife obtained a divorce from defendant husband in a cause based on extreme cruelty as defined in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:34-2. On appeal, defendant argued that plaintiff did not establish a cause for divorce under that statute. The court noted that while plaintiff's proofs were far from impressive, the trial court was not incorrect to conclude that plaintiff could no longer cohabit with defendant. Defendant also maintained that N.J. Stat. ann. &sect; 45:14B-28 was unconstitutional. The court determined that defendant cited the wrong statute as his argument concerned confidential communications to marriage counselor. The relevant statute was N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:8B-29. Defendant contended that a legislative classification whereby licensed practicing psychologists or marriage counselors were treated differently from medical doctors violated the equal protection clause. However, the court disagreed, and found that a reasonable basis likely existed for the distinction between a physician treating a disease and a psychologist or marriage counsellor endeavoring to reconcile embittered spouses. Accordingly, the trial court's judgment of divorce was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment of divorce was affirmed. Sufficient evidence supported trial court's determination that plaintiff wife and defendant husband could no longer cohabit together and should be divorced. Additionally, the New Jersey statute that established a protected privilege to communications between a licensed practicing psychologist and his clientele did not run afoul of the equal protection clause. No costs were awarded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of numerous counts of distribution of heroin and possession with intent to distribute heroin. She was sentenced to consecutive terms by the trial court. The court affirmed the convictions and sentences, in part. The court ruled that defendant should not have been convicted of both distribution of heroin and possession with intent to distribute. The court noted that there was no evidence that defendant was in possession of any heroin other than that which she sold to the undercover officer. As such, the court found that defendant's possession of drugs prior to the sales was an essential element of the unlawful distribution. The court also rejected defendant's argument that her conduct constituted one continuing transaction. The court found that there were three separate sales of drugs, on three separate dates. Consequently, defendant was properly charged with three separate sales. Finally, observing the seriousness of the offenses, the court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing consecutive sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court's judgment as to the convictions for possession of heroin with intent to distribute because defendant's possession of the drugs was an essential element of the crime of distribution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant New Jersey Natural Resource Council (Council) changed several times the amount of consideration it was going to charge plaintiff property owner for two grants of riparian rights. The final total set by the Council and approved by defendant New Jersey Environmental Protection Commissioner (Commissioner) was $ 127,000. Plaintiff appealed the final total and asserted that defendant State of New Jersey was equitably estopped from reconsidering the grant prices, but the court held that it was clear under the facts that the necessary elements of estoppel were not present. Plaintiff asserted that she was denied due process because she was not afforded a hearing to challenge the price set by the Council of $ 85,000 prior to the setting of the final price of $ 127,000. The court held that because plaintiff did not possess any right to the riparian lands until the final price was set under N.J. Stat. 13:1B-13 she could not have been denied due process. The court finally rejected plaintiff's contention that the compensation for the riparian grants was unjust because the Council based the consideration on the fair market value of the property, which the court deemed as proper.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs contended that N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant corporations were allowed to issue hospital and medical insurance plans for student accident insurance policies approved by defendant commissioner. On appeal, the court reversed the summary judgment, which declared that defendant corporations were acting within their statutory authority in issuing the policies. Defendant corporations did not contest that they were acting as insurers, and there was no authority in the statutes allowing defendant corporations to act as insurers. The test that had to be applied in determining whether an undertaking was &quot;insurance&quot; or not was whether, looking at the plan as a whole, service rather than indemnity was its principal purpose. Applying this analysis, the court determined the plans at issue in no way differed from an accident policy issued by an ordinary insurance company. To construe the statutes under which defendant corporations operated to allow their sale of insurance effectively denied equal protection of the laws to insurance companies that had to meet capital and asset requirements and did not have the same exemption from taxes as did defendant corporations.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was indicted for extortion in violation of N.J. Stat. &sect; 2A:105-1. The trial judge denied defendant's motion for acquittal on this count, ruling that that criminal intent was not an essential element of the statutory crime of extortion proscribed by N.J. Stat.

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial judge committed error in refusing to charge that in order to find him guilty of extortion, the jury had to find that he made a demand for an illegal fee. The court held that proof of a demand was not a necessary element for extortion and that acceptance of money as a gratuity without making a demand was no defense. Also, the court held that selectivity in enforcement did not constitute a violation of equal protection rights. Further, the court rejected defendant's argument that criminal intent to commit extortion had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

The court held that parole could be revoked where defendant's breaches of parole conditions were related to a continuing sexual disorder or the need for continued supervision. Because defendant's violation of parole by commission of nonsexual offenses did not provide a basis for a finding that defendant required continuing treatment as a sex offender, and as there was no finding that such treatment was required, the case was remanded with directions to reparole defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, county hospital superintendent and commissioner of institutions and agencies, were convicted of knowingly and willingly obtaining money for their private housekeepers, as the moneys were not lawfully due to the private housekeepers because no services were rendered by them to or for the hospital. This occurred after defendant superintendent and defendant commissioner's own housekeepers were put on the hospital payroll. The court affirmed, finding that the trial court properly instructed the jury and that to the extent that it was not proper, the error was harmless because the record supported guilt and ignorance was no defense. The court found that there was no error in the trial court's change of the jury instructions following a mistrial because the record showed that the change did not have any determinative impact on the jury's deliberations or divert it from a full and proper consideration of the evidence governed by correct principles. The court also found that the trial court properly rejected evidence of past practices of public officials because there was no credible or relevant evidence in the nature of a custom that could otherwise be applied to domestics.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order of a court of New Jersey, which convicted him of engaging in the business of loan sharking, in violation of N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of engaging in the business of loan sharking, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:119A-3, and of seven counts of loan sharking for making individual loans. He was sentenced on all eight convictions consecutively. The court affirmed his convictions, but merged his sentences. The court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 2A:119A-3 was unconstitutionally vague. Its meaning was clear to men of common intelligence. The court also found that it was not error for the trial judge to refuse to charge the jury that scienter was an element of the crime. The legislature could, as a matter of public policy, declare an act unlawful without proof of a wrongful intent, and defendant clearly was aware that loaning money at rates of 200 and 300 percent was unlawful. The court did not find that prosecution's statements in summation deprived defendant of a fair trial. Although strong, the statements were justifiably made in light of the evidence and defense counsel's summation. The court held, however, that the offenses of loan sharking for making individual loans were necessarily merged as lesser-included offenses of engaging in the business of loan sharking.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for engaging in the business of loan sharking because the underlying statute was constitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent state agency brought suit to enforce its order that respondent commission construct a water filtration plant, the costs to be borne by appellants, municipalities, and others. On remand after appeal, the trial court entered judgment directing that the order be implemented and that respondent commission pay damages to one of appellants for loss of value to its old plant. Appellants sought review. The court affirmed. The court agreed with the trial court's conclusion that the expert testimony in favor of the chosen site exceeded clear and convincing standards of proof and was thus based upon substantial evidence. The court found it reasonable, based on the statutory scheme, to posit an implied statutory and contractual power in respondent commission to furnish additional facilities and improvements at the joint expense of the participating municipalities. Because the economic injury to appellants could not be equated with a taking of their property, the court found the trial court's assessment of damages reasonable. The court found that the trial court properly determined that respondent commission was empowered to issue bonds in connection with the proposed plant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate pleaded guilty to atrocious assault and battery and possession of a dangerous weapon, and received concurrent 12-month sentences in the county penitentiary. His attorneys requested respondent New Jersey State Parole Board to consider appellant for parole, under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:4-123.35, upon the expiration of one-third of his sentence. Respondent declined the request, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed respondent's decision. The court stated that appellant had standing to assert that he had been unconstitutionally excluded from the class of prisoners granted parole eligibility. The court stated, though, that classification of prisoners for parole eligibility purposes was not inherently suspect like classifications based on race, and concluded that the statutory parole scheme, which created eligibility for parole consideration only for those sentenced to more than one year and denied parole to those sentenced to a year or less, did not unconstitutionally discriminate against inmates under sentence of a year or less. The court also held that the different time requirements for parole eligibility between county and State prisoners were justified.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction and that section 2A: 170-99 was unconstitutional. The court held that the evidence was sufficient and that section 2A: 170-99 was constitutional because its use of presumption (the statute allowed a prima facie inference of shoplifting to be drawn from proof of willful concealment and a prima facie inference of willful concealment to be drawn from concealment) made a rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed. The court further held that the statute did not improperly dispense with the element of intent because the legislature could make the doing of a prohibited act a crime, regardless of criminal purpose.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Husband died from injuries sustained in a collision with defendant trooper. Defendants, trooper and police, successfully asserted the defense of sovereign immunity in a motion for summary judgment in plaintiff spouse's wrongful death action. The court affirmed, observing that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:4A-1 provided that no cause of action accruing before July 1, 1972, could be instituted against defendants. The legislature's reinstatement of sovereign immunity in &sect; 52:4A-1 literally meant that plaintiff had no cause of action, and so did not deprive plaintiff of a vested right in her cause of action. The court also held that the prospective application of the New Jersey Tort Claims Act, &sect; 59:1-1 et seq., did not violate the equal protection clause because it represented a legislative recognition of established judicial policy to provide relief to litigants before a court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that granted summary judgment to defendants, trooper and police, in plaintiff spouse's wrongful death suit. The statute providing sovereign immunity did not impose a moratorium on asserting the defense, and in effect, literally meant that plaintiff had no cause of action. The statute did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A board, established by respondent New Jersey Racing Commission (Commission), revoked appellant licensee's owner's license. Respondent affirmed, predicated upon appellant's non-membership in the United States Trotting Association (Association), appellant's falsifying an application, and appellant's arrest record and association with persons convicted of crime. The court initially held that the board's action was meaningless and a complete nullity because the only the Commission was statutorily authorized to revoke a license. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5:5-33, and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 5:5-51 to 5:5-61. Appellant's non-membership in the trotting association was irrelevant, because its rules could not have been carried over to the statutory delegation of authority vested in respondent, and effectively used to veto a function conferred by the state. Appellant's arrest record was irrelevant because it was not an acceptable index of appellant's morals and character. However, the court remanded the matter so that respondent could have determined in the first instance that the proven falsification of the application and association with criminals were adequate reasons to revoke appellant's license.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, taxi company and drivers' representatives, sought a declaratory judgment to determine that overtime provisions of the New Jersey Wage and Hour Law (law), N.J.

The trial court held that the provisions did apply, that they represented a valid exercise of legislative power, and that the area was not preempted by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 201 et seq. Appellants sought review, and the court affirmed. The court noted that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:11-56a4, although exempting common carriers of passengers by motor bus from the law's overtime provisions, contained no exclusion for taxicab operators or the taxicab industry. Appellants' thesis was that the words, &quot;motor bus&quot; as used in the statute must be construed to include taxicabs; the court deemed such a construction unnatural in light of the statute's legislative history. The court concluded that there was no conflict between the law and the FLSA; therefore, there was no preemption. The classification used for the exception was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or without relevance to the legislative goal.</SPAN></P>

Uniform Narcotic Drug Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24:18-4 (now the Controlled Dangerous Substances Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24:21-1 et seq.). Defendants contended that marijuana was not properly classified as a narcotic and that &sect; 24:18-4 violated their right to equal protection. The court affirmed. The court held that the legislature had determined that marijuana was classifiable as a narcotic and that the legislature had broad classification powers, which legitimately might affect some groups of citizens differently than others. The court held that proof that marijuana had been reclassified by the Controlled Dangerous Substances Act was not proof that the prior classification was irrational. The court held that defendants had no fundamental right to possess marijuana and that the trial judge properly denied defendants' motion to suppress. The court held that the police had a right to stop defendants for a safety violation, and the fact that they were found not guilty did not impugn the integrity of the initial stop.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs were innocent and the raid was a mistake.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant witness was subpoenaed to appear before the State Commission of Investigation, to testify in reference to organized crime and racketeering in New Jersey and appellant refused. The lower court denied appellant's motion to suppress the subpoena, held appellant in contempt, and incarcerated him indefinitely until he agreed to comply. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's order. The court held that appellant's challenges on U.S. Const. amend. I grounds were meritless because the freedom of association did not protect affiliation with groups who pursued illegal interests and there was no mention of a particular ethnic group within N.J. Stat. Ann. 52:9M-1 et seq. as the statute that established the commission. The court held that a jury trial was not required before appellant's incarceration and that indefinite incarceration was not cruel and unusual because the matter involved a civil contempt action and appellant could end the term himself by complying with the legal duty to testify.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state appealed a decision of the Municipal Court of Woodbridge Township (New Jersey), finding defendant barber not guilty of violating the township ordinance to regulate hours of operating and closing of barber shops and other businesses. The issues were whether the not guilty finding barred the appeal and whether the ordinance violated equal protection principles or the Law Against Discrimination (Law), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10:5-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The barber cut a man's hair after the closing hour required by the ordinance. Initially, the court noted that N.J. Ct. R. 3:10-3, which required that a constitutional issue be raised before trial or after a verdict of guilty, was made applicable to the municipal court and ordinances by N.J. Ct. R. 7:4-2(e), so the constitutional issue decided in the municipal court was appealable. Because the municipal court's ruling was made before trial, double jeopardy did not attach. The court held that although the barber shop ordinance regulated hours of opening and closing, while a beauty parlor ordinance did not, there was no invidious discrimination. While similarities in the occupations were apparent and differences might not be clear, it was for the legislature to determine the remedy. The court contrasted New Jersey law with new regulations issued in New York, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 19, &sect; 166.27. The court noted that there was a strong presumption of the constitutionality of the ordinance. The court held that the ordinance was a reasonable exercise of the police power, the classification was within lawful bounds, and it did not deny equal protection or violate the Law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded for disposition of the charge laid in the complaint.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the murder conviction but vacated the armed robbery conviction. The court held that there was no abuse of discretion in the denial of defendant's motion to strike the charge of felony murder because, where principals in a joint indictment for murder were tried separately, the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata did not apply to the second defendant tried. The court found no abuse of discretion in the denial of defendant's motion for a mistrial. The court held that the penalty of life imprisonment for murder in the first degree was mandatory under N.J.

If appellants failed to timely apply for relief, the trial court's dismissal of their complaint would be affirmed. If appellants applied for relief, respondents were to take proofs and choose whether to compel dedication or to relegate to a possible future condemnation. The court found that respondent planning board could not in every case require dedication of lands for rights of way along county roads without paying just compensation as a waiver of the dedication was permissible. If the county later decided to widen the existing road, it would have to condemn and pay for what land it took.

She was removed from the beach, charged with violating the ordinance and, at the hearing, presented no testimony but argued the unconstitutionality of the ordinance, reserving her right to raise the constitutional issues on appeal. Initially, the county court noted that beach lover had standing to contest the validity and constitutionality of all portions of the ordinance. Further, it found that the differences in costs of seasonal beach badges purchased before and after May 31 was not discriminatory. Yet, it held that basing the beginning and ending of the effectiveness of a weekly badge, so as to split up a weekend, was unreasonable both on its face and in its application. Nevertheless, provisions declared invalid were separable from the ordinance, and, thus, the ordinance was not devitalized. Hence, the county court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent landowner sought an adjudication that respondent township acted arbitrarily in denying a variance and that respondent township's zoning ordinance was void, unconstitutional, and ineffective to prevent respondent from using its premises for office purposes. The court found that respondent should have been given the opportunity to determine whether the erection of a new building, a change in the physical situation, warranted the grant of a variance permitting respondent to use its property for office parking purposes. The court further found that the only effect of the ordinance limitation at issue was to prevent respondent from adding to the substantial parking area it already had. The court found that the burden cast on the relatively small portion of respondent's property by the zone line provision of the ordinance afforded no basis for declaring the provision invalid. However, the court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the case for entry of a judgment in favor of appellant, concluding that the record did not warrant judicial interference with the discretion of the governing body which adopted the limiting ordinance provision.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional on its face and dismissed the complaint against defendants. The court held that pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:12-6, the borough, through its board of recreation commissioners, was empowered to regulate the use of the parks. The court found, however, that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague as the term &quot;loitering&quot; was not defined and that the ordinance lacked a provision that required the police to issue a warning to individuals to leave the park.</SPAN></P>

The jury returned a guilty verdict, but the trial judge entered a judgment of acquittal, reasoning that it would be unconstitutionally arbitrary to convict defendant based on the statutory presumption that possession of unstamped cigarettes was prima facie evidence that the possessor had engaged in the sale of untaxed cigarettes. The state appealed the trial judge's decision. The court found that the state's reliance on a prior decision of the United States Supreme Court was misplaced because the statute did not criminalize possession of untaxed cigarettes with the intent to sell them.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff police benevolent association appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, which ruled in a declaratory judgment action that defendants, the mayor, city council, New Jersey attorney general, and others, could not legally pay town policemen overtime at a rate of one and one half times their regular wages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff police benevolent association filed a declaratory judgment action against defendants, the mayor, city council, New Jersey attorney general, and others, seeking an adjudication that municipalities could pay overtime to police officers at a rate in excess of straight time. The trial court ruled that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:14-134 limited the authority of municipalities to pay police officers for overtime at the officer's regular straight wage rate. Plaintiffs appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that the language of &sect; 40A:14-134 was clear that municipalities could only pay officers overtime at the regular straight time rate. The court further held, however, that &sect; 40A:14-134 had been subsequently amended to allow payment of overtime to officers at a rate not in excess of one and one half times their wage rate despite plaintiff's contention that the appeal was not moot. The court held that it was the legislature's prerogative to decide what municipalities could agree to pay police officers for overtime work.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that municipalities had limited authority to pay police officers for overtime at the officers' regular straight wage rate, but noted that the legislature had amended the applicable statute to allow payment of overtime to officers at a rate not in excess of one and one half times their wage rate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retail vendor brought an action in replevin against defendant consumer, seeking judgment for possession of merchandise sold to defendant and, as damages, the unpaid balance of the purchase price due with respect to said merchandise. Defendant claimed the agreement on which plaintiff based its claims violated the Retail Installment Sales Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:16C-1 et seq., and counterclaimed for damages for wrongful repossession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A consumer purchased one item of merchandise from a retail vendor under an agreement to pay the purchase price in equal monthly installments. Thereafter, the consumer purchased another item from the retail vendor under an agreement to pay in equal monthly installments, and two other items under a credit plan agreement that did not provide for equal monthly payments. When the consumer failed to make monthly payments, the retail vendor repossessed and resold the merchandise without prior notice and prior to the entry of any judgment. The court dismissed the retail vendor's complaint for replevin and for the balance of the unpaid purchase prices because the transactions between the parties were retail installment sales subject to the provisions of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:16C-1 et seq., not retail charge account transactions, and, as such, were unconscionable, void, and unenforceable because the consumer was not furnished with the information required by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:16C-27, and was given no opportunity to redeem the repossessed items in violation of N.J. Stat. &sect;17:16C-29.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant uttered loud and indecent language in a public place where women and young people were present. Defendant was convicted as a disorderly person for using loud and indecent language at a public meeting in a public school in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A: 170-29(1). The state supreme court denied certification after the conviction had been affirmed. The United States Supreme Court vacated and remanded for reconsideration in light of recent precedents interpreting U.S. Const. amend. I. On remand, the court vacated the judgment of conviction and dismissed the complaint against defendant. The court held that it mattered not that the language used might be constitutionally prohibited under a narrowly and precisely drawn statute. The court stated that if a statute, either as drawn or as authoritatively construed by the courts of the state in question, was susceptible of application to protected expression, it was overly broad and facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendants' motion to suppress the evidence resulting from the wiretap orders finding that there was no special need for a wiretap on public telephones as required by the New Jersey Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, N.J.

They had separated, and demand for payment of the medical expenses was made upon the wife before the action was begun. The court noted that the reason for their separation did not matter because the services were rendered while the parties resided together. The court reviewed case law from France, England, and the United States dating as far back as 1659. The court noted that the common law rights of women had enjoyed a slow but almost uninterrupted expansion, and every right carried with it a corresponding duty. The court ruled that, while there was no question that the husband was liable to the hospital for the medical services rendered to his wife and child, it was not the hospital's exclusive remedy. The court ruled that the action against the wife was cognizable by it, and that the wife, as the recipient of the services rendered to her, was liable for the services furnished to her.</SPAN></P>

The court exercised its original jurisdiction, disposed of the appeal on the merits, and affirmed the conviction, holding that the county police had the authority to stop appellant. The court held that the county was chargeable with the repair and maintenance of the bridges within its borders and a recognized source of damage to the bridges was the operation of vehicles over them which exceed their posted load limits; therefore, the county police had the authority to stop appellant after he had travelled over the bridge. The court further held that the tractor-trailer was weighed in the appropriate manner.

They later returned and were then arrested for trespassing on school property in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:170-31. On appeal, the court noted that admission of the school regulations by the trial court was harmless since that court did not consider them in relation to the substance of defendants' conduct but rather with relation to the authority of the school officials to request them to leave school grounds. Additionally, the court found that none of the cases cited by defendants supported their position that their activity on school grounds was protected by the First Amendment. Rather, defendants were simply guilty of trespass, as they were not students and were engaged in non-school activities and they returned to the school grounds after they had been forbidden to be on the property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife questioned the constitutionality of the Act on the ground that it permitted the taking of property by force without a preliminary trial-type hearing, alleging that it violated the U.S. Const. amend. IV and XIV. An order to show cause provided as interim relief that specific items of furniture, including a refrigerator, be returned to the furniture company. The court determined from the evidence that there was ground for reformation of the contract to exclude the recapture clause. The court did not reach the constitutional question. The evidence was such that the wife did not know that the contract contained a provision permitting retaking on default. The evidence showed also that the wife was not capable of understanding the recapture clause as written. She was a woman of limited intelligence and utterly without business experience. Intellectually and financially, she was completely at the mercy of the furniture company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the wife be permitted to retain the furniture that was restored to her by reason of the order made in conjunction with the order to show cause.

The court considered defendant's challenge to the validity of &sect; 2A:148-10. The court found that the statute was narrowly construed in past precedent involving the predecessor statute to be limited to certain situations including assaulting a police officer. The court considered this charge against defendant to address clearly unlawful conduct in light of the statute's terms. The court found that the element of intent was included within the offense and proof of this element was required. The court reviewed the opening summation of defendant's counsel that inquired whether the language defendant spoke to the surrounding crowd incited an assault on a police officer. The court reviewed the jury charge that focused on making findings of inciting and of criminal intent, to which no objection was made by defendant's counsel. Defendant told the crowd surrounding a police officer, who was physically holding an African-American boy, to &quot;get the cop.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a denial of post-conviction relief by the trial court (New Jersey). Defendant contended that his prior convictions were inadmissible for the purpose of impeachment because he was not represented as to the prior convictions and he had not waived counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted, on cross-examination, prior convictions in another state for escape and highway robbery. Defendant was convicted of armed robbery and unsuccessfully sought post-conviction relief on the ground that such admissions were inherently prejudicial because defendant had lacked assistance of counsel at the time of the prior convictions and had not waived counsel. On review of defendant's petition for post-conviction relief, the court held that the use of defendant's prior uncounseled convictions to attack his credibility at the trial impaired his rights under U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV. The court concluded that the erroneous admission of the convictions was not harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt because the remaining evidence was not so overwhelming against defendant that the invalid convictions played no role in the verdict. On the issue of retroactive application of recent case law, the court held that because defendant's conviction had not become final until after the ruling, he was entitled to its benefit in his post-conviction proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of defendant's post-conviction petition for a new trial was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the trial court for testimony and findings on the issues of the presence of counsel and waiver.

He was convicted of possessing a rifle and possessing a shotgun in an car without a New Jersey firearms purchaser identification card. Before the court was defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the verdict of guilty. The key issue was whether conduct on the part of a citizen domiciled in a state other than New Jersey could result in a conviction of a high misdemeanor in the New Jersey when it was performed while the citizen was merely traveling through New Jersey. The court determined that it could not, and granted the motion for acquittal. A resident of another state could not be expected to know, or to ascertain for purposes of driving through the New Jersey, the requirements of the firearms statute which differed from those of his state of domicile.

The court determined that as a parishioner of defendant church, plaintiff was a beneficiary of the &quot;works&quot; of the church and came within the ambit of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:53A-7. Further, it had been held in a previous case that this statute did not violate the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court went on to explain that since the statute provided that no nonprofit corporation, such as was defendant here, shall be liable to respond in damages to a beneficiary of its works, the fact that it may have had insurance coverage conferred no additional rights upon plaintiff.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant real estate commission required all applicants for salesman, broker-salesman or broker's licenses to be fingerprinted. In accordance with N. J. Admin. Code tit. 2, &sect; 2-3(a)(2), plaintiff here challenged this enactment on the grounds that defendant was without legislative authority for its action and the rule was an unconstitutional invasion of privacy violative of the fourth, ninth and fourteenth amendments to the U. S. Constitution. The court held that the decree that no license shall be issued to any person convicted within the past five years of specified crimes, and provided for the revocation of a license upon conviction, or the suspension of a license on indictment, for certain crimes was constitutional because the grant of such an express power was always attended by the incidental authority fairly and reasonably necessary or appropriate to make it effective. The court concluded that the authority to require fingerprinting was within the intent of the legislature in its delegation to defendant of authority to license proper applicants, and the intrusion on the right of privacy, was indeed justified in the public interest; therefore, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff complainants brought an action seeking to have the ordinance declared invalid. The trial court found certain sections invalid and upheld other sections. In response defendant amended the ordinance and the court considered the amended ordinance. Plaintiffs alleged that the ordinance inhibited freedom of free speech. The court noted that the right to freedom of speech did not permit everyone to express his opinions at a public place at any time, and also noted its to duty construe ordinances as constitutional if reasonably susceptible to that interpretation. The court found that the ordinance was not vague as standards for the approval of a permit were set out. However, the ordinance allowed defendant to withhold a determination until five days before the scheduled date of the parade and that provision was unconstitutional as an invalid prior restraint because there was not sufficient time to review the decision.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:156A-1 et seq. (1968), was unconstitutional, and therefore the warrant to allow the wiretap was illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police suspected that defendants were engaged in various gambling offenses, and requested a wiretap on their phones. The issuing judge granting the wiretap under the New Jersey Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:156A-1 et seq. (1968). Defendants were subsequently indicted for violating the state's gambling laws, and they filed a motion to suppress, arguing that the Act was illegal, and therefore evidence obtained through the wiretap should not be admitted at trial. The court held that the Act was constitutional and conformed with due process. However, the court stated that the police improperly reordered all phone conversations, even those that were irrelevant to illegal activities. The court determined that because one of defendant's phone conversations were almost all relevant to the criminal activities, that defendant's motion to suppress would be denied. The court granted the remaining defendants' motion to suppress, concluding that the police's practice to record every conversation indiscriminately did in fact result in the acquisition of a substantial number of nonsubject calls.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed by county police driving a tractor-trailer containing a liquid cargo over a bridge that was posted for a maximum load of 15 tons.

The court affirmed the conviction, stating that the language and legislative history of N.J. Stat.

If the states could regulate truck weights and sizes without running afoul of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3, the enforcement of such legislation could be accomplished by any class of police officer in whom such authority was generally vested, so long as there was no discrimination against interstate traffic.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the state leave to appeal and reversed and remanded for trial, at which defendant was found guilty and fined. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed.

The exception allowed a person lacking a permit to keep a revolver at an establishment, a structure, or on land, and not in a private automobile. The fact that defendant transported money to a bank in connection with his business did not put defendant within the exception because his automobile was not his business establishment.

Because the juror was merely confused during the poll and concurred in the final verdict, defendants were not prejudiced.

Plaintiffs sought review, contending that the ordinance failed to sufficiently define the proscribed conduct, that it was so broad and encompassing as to impair the freedoms of speech and expression, and that it granted excessive decision-making power to police to determine the criminality of conduct. On appeal, the court noted that the ordinance would have been invalid if the sole act of loitering were proscribed, but that the ordinance under review only proscribed loitering that brought about conditions enumerated therein, such as a breach of the peace.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant corporation sought review of a decision of the Camden County Court (New Jersey) that convicted defendant of six separate moving violations relating to transporting materials in commercial vehicles without the load completely covered by a tarpaulin.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant corporation owned and operated large tractor-trailers which it used to transport various sized stone and stone dust on the New Jersey Turnpike without the loads being covered by tarpaulins. As a result, stones and dust had spilled from trucks similarly loaded and had damaged other vehicles and scattered debris on the Turnpike. The state police had warned defendant, prior to the day these violations occurred, that such loads should be covered as required by Regulation 11 of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority (Authority) or it would be prosecuted. Subsequently, defendant was caught violating Regulation 11 on six separate occasions and was convicted of such. On appeal, the court found that there was sufficient credible evidence to support the trial judge's determination that the loads in question were inclined to spill as proscribed by the Regulation. The court opined that defendant's argument that Regulation 11 was unconstitutionally vague because of insufficient standards so as to comply with the regulation was without merit. The court determined that the Authority's expertise in dealing with the Turnpike must be recognized and the resulting valid regulations enforced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant corporation's conviction for six moving violations was affirmed. The court found that defendant's argument that the regulation was unconstitutionally vague was meritless. There was sufficient evidence to convict and the regulation was a valid exercise of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's power. The court concluded that there was no inconsistency between the regulation and the statute that granted the Authority power to regulate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on his plea of guilty of assault with intent to rob and of being armed with a revolver while committing the assault. He was sentenced to two consecutive indeterminate terms. After a prison transfer, he was thereafter resentenced to a term of not less than five years and not more than seven years, and to a consecutive term of not less than two years nor more than three years. His petition sought relief on the ground that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:151-5 as applied to him was unconstitutional in that it punished him twice for one offense. The trial court denied his petition, but granted leave to appeal the decision and ordered the office of public defender to represent him. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial, holding that defendant's contentions were manifestly frivolous. The court found that consecutive sentences for assault with intent to rob and for doing so while armed did not constitute offensive multiple punishment for the same violation. In addition, the court opined that there was no finding by the trial court of good cause to refer this petition to the office of the public defender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted for violating &sect; 7-C of the city ordinance regulating the licensing and running at large of dogs after a citizen alleged that defendant failed to remove feces deposited by defendant's Great Dane dog. Defendant contended on appeal that &sect; 7-C offended the Equal Protection Clause of the Federal and State Constitutions, because it contained an unreasonable classification in singling out dogs for this type of regulation and it was unrelated in any substantial degree to the health, safety, and welfare of the community and its inhabitants. Defendant further alleged that the ordinance failed to provide an adequate standard for the enabling means of disposition of the excrement. The court rejected defendant's arguments and affirmed his conviction. The court found that the ordinance was related to public heath and safety and that the legislature had broad discretion in that regard; further, dogs are generally made the subject of special and peculiar regulations without depriving their owners of any constitutional right. The ordinance was also not defective for failing to provide a more specific standard for the disposition and removal of the dog feces.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore the court found that the procedures indicated by &sect; 40:69A-60 were found in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:27-4 to 12.

Defendants were eventually indicted by the grand jury for conspiracy to violate the gambling laws. Defendants filed a motion to suppress evidence obtained through the wiretap. The court held that the electronic surveillance of a public facility should be targeted to the prime suspects and away from innocent and unwitting persons. The court determined that consideration should be given to the availability or actual use of the public telephone by members of the public or persons in no way connected with the criminal activities. The court stated that in this case, the wiretap did not limit the surveillance of the public telephone to the prime suspect; it extended the permissible surveillance to persons vaguely described as unknown white males. The court concluded that the wiretap was excessive and unreasonable, and therefore granted defendants' motion to suppress the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Eleven months after the alleged sale defendant was arrested and he was subsequently convicted and sentenced for the offense.

The court also found that the two year-prison term given to defendant was unnecessarily harsh and ill-designed to serve any useful purpose because defendant was a young college student with a good academic record, plans to get married, no criminal background other than possession, and regular attendance at church.

Plaintiff was listed eighth on a list of eligibles and was not given veteran's status. After certification of the top three individuals on the list, plaintiff appealed. Plaintiff contended that N.J. Admin. Code tit. 4, &sect; 9-4, permitting evaluation of education and experience in excess of minimum requirements, violated his due process and equal protection rights and that the state erred in failing to qualify him as a veteran. On appeal, the court affirmed the determination of the state civil service commission. The court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11:9-3, which indicated that education and experience should be taken into consideration where relevant to determine qualifications to perform a position, provided standards sufficiently definitive to satisfy the requirements of due process. Nor was there a violation of equal protection where the designated class, those with extensive education and experience, was reasonably selected to fulfill state policy. The court held further that the federal government did not require the state to follow its designation of veterans.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated summary contempt proceeding, the trial court sentenced defendant teachers to jail terms and fines and fined defendant teachers association for having violated an order restraining them from striking in a labor dispute. The court affirmed in defendants' consolidated appeal and held that the restraining order was constitutional and that the record showed that defendants knew about the order and knowingly violated it by striking. The court found that it was proper to fine defendant association in the summary contempt proceeding because a conviction that could result only in the imposition of a money fine, regardless of the amount, and not in imprisonment, did not give rise to a right to a jury trial or turn a petty offense into a serious one. The court found that, because defendant association could not be jailed for contempt, it, as a corporation, was sufficiently dissimilar to individuals to warrant the imposition of a large fine in the summary contempt proceeding. The court therefore held that a reasonable fine could be imposed against defendant association and that the fine imposed against it was proper under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

They intended to do this by going from door to door. They were informed that they could not enter upon the premises, but did so anyway and were convicted of trespassing pursuant to &sect; 2A:170-31. The court dismissed the nine complaints and held that the court could not allow the corporate officers of the community to decide to bar what it knew to be a bona fide political endeavor. Although the guaranties of free speech and free press could not be used to force a community to admit peddlers or solicitors of publications to the homes of its residents, such guaranties should be used to insure that each individual alone decides what political and religious information he wishes to receive.</SPAN></P>

Responding police officers, in searching the vehicle for evidence of defendant's vehicle registration, found a pistol in the locked glove compartment of his vehicle. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress the evidence of the search on the ground that the officer's actions were unreasonable under U.S. Const. amend. IV. The state appealed and the court reversed. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-31 required the police to investigate the auto accident in which defendant was involved. Pursuant to that charge, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:3-29 required the police to procure and examine the licenses and vehicle registration of the drivers involved. When defendant was unable to produce his vehicle registration on request, the police were entitled to search for it. The officer who conducted the search confined his examination to the location in the vehicle where it was most logical to look for the document. There was nothing improper or unreasonable in his doing so. That defendant might have earlier showed his vehicle registration to a different police officer was irrelevant, as the officer who conducted the search did not know of the occurrence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant motor carrier sought review of a decision of respondent Division of Motor Vehicles (New Jersey), which denied its claim for refund for payment of road use taxes assessed by other states measured by motor fuel used by its vehicles on highways in those states on which motor fuel sales taxes were paid in New Jersey pursuant to the Motor Fuel Sales Tax, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:39-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an audit, appellant motor carrier was found to owe road use taxes assessed by other states in prior years for which motor fuel sales tax had been paid in New Jersey under the Motor Fuel Sales Tax Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:39-1 et seq. A refund was permitted under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54.39A-8 of the Motor Carriers Road Tax Act of 1963, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:39A-1 et seq., with a limitation period of four months to make a claim for refund. Respondent Division of Motor Vehicles denied a refund because there was no entitlement for refund for earlier years and the other refund demand was untimely. The court affirmed respondent's decision because the limitation period for claims was not unreasonable. The court found that the absence of a refund provision did not impose double taxation because the road use taxes and fuel sales taxes were separate, distinct, and free from constitutional defect. The court further found that the failure to relieve appellant for road taxes paid elsewhere was not an appropriate basis for constitutional attack and that neither tax, nor a combination thereof, constituted a forbidden burden upon interstate commerce or a double taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed respondent Division of Motor Vehicles' denial of appellant motor carrier's claim because the denial of refund did not result in double taxation and the failure to refund taxes imposed by other states was not an appropriate basis for constitutional attack on the Motor Fuel Sales Tax Act. The court held that the road use and motor fuel sales taxes were valid, separate, and distinct and that the limitation period was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New York detectives followed defendant to New Jersey and reported to local police that defendant was suspected of transporting unstamped cigarettes on the public highways, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:40A-32. Defendant was arrested therefor, and local police obtained a warrant, based in part on information supplied by the New York detectives, to search defendant's house trailer. Within, police found thousands of unstamped cartons of cigarettes. Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 54:40A-32 and appealed. The court affirmed. That defendant's warrant derived from information provided by other law enforcement officers was sufficient to establish probable cause, as such information was more reliable than that supplied by a typical informer interested only in reward. Similarly, it was irrelevant that the affidavit supporting the warrant contained some incorrect information. None of the inaccuracies was material. Further, N.J. Ct. R. 3:5-7(d) excepted warrants from such collateral attack, provided that no bad faith was apparent, as was true in defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father sought to establish the paternity of a child born out of wedlock and reasonable visitation rights. The parties had cohabited before the child's birth and had lived together as a family after the child was born. The mother conceded that the father was the child's natural father, but maintained that the court was without jurisdiction to grant visitation to the father in the absence of a claim for child support and that the father of a child born out of wedlock did not have any right to visitation without the express or implied consent of the mother. The court held that it must consider visitation by the father to be the natural right of each child and that the court had jurisdiction over matters affecting the welfare of illegitimate children. Further, if in the proper case the court could grant custody to the father of an illegitimate child, it could grant visitation in the proper case. Secondly, the court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:16-1 did not prohibit the court from granting visitation to the natural father of an illegitimate child without the consent of the mother. The court construed &sect; 9:16-1 to only deny a putative father's right access to the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile filed a motion to limit his commitment to a reformatory to a term not greater than six months, following his adjudication as a delinquent with regard to charges that he was under the influence of heroin and an order that committed him to the reformatory for an indefinite term not to extend beyond his twenty-first birthday, pursuant to N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that because the maximum sentence an adult could be given for the same offense was six months, the indefinite term here imposed constituted an unjustifiable differentiation in treatment, thus denying defendant equal protection of the law. The court denied the motion, holding that although a juvenile was entitled to the four basic rights of notice of the charges, representation by counsel, confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses, and the privilege against self-incrimination, the disposition of juvenile offenders to terms that might result in commitment for a period of time longer than that which an adult could receive for the same offense did not violate equal protection. The goal of the juvenile court system was the education, treatment, and rehabilitation of the juvenile rather than punishment. With such a purpose, a classification based on age was not so arbitrary, irrational, or capricious as to render the treatment of juveniles unconstitutional. The classification based on age and its application to commitment was theoretically reasonable; defendant did not show that the juvenile system did not in practice live up to its high theoretical ideals.</SPAN></P>

The court was concerned that the effect of placing the child with parents who were not believers was to abridge the child's right to believe.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers stopped defendant's vehicle because they were &quot;suspicious&quot; of defendant's slow speed and because he and an occupant were looking from side to side.

The court held that the fruits of an unconstitutional and unreasonable search and seizure must be suppressed. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:3-29 authorized a temporary detention of the vehicle to check for a driver's license and registration. Here, the police did not have probable cause to validate the consequent search.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, redevelopment agency and related individual, sought review of the summary judgment of the trial court (New Jersey), which sustained N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, redevelopment agency and related individual, brought suit against defendants, state attorney general and related others, to obtain a judgment that declared N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20:1-9 and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55-21.10 unconstitutional. In eminent domain proceedings involving the development or redevelopment of blighted areas, plaintiffs claimed that those enactments provided that the value of any property sought to be acquired would be determined at no less than the value thereof as of the final declaration of blight by the municipality concerned. The trial court sustained the statutory provisions as valid and granted summary judgment to defendants. Plaintiffs appealed and the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court found that no improper classification by the legislature in providing for a valuation date for condemnation of property declared blighted different from that applicable to the generality of condemnation proceedings acts. The statutes did not contravene constitutional principles concerned with just compensation for land taken for public purposes. The statutes did not allow for an invalid donation of public money to private persons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, attorney general and related individuals against plaintiffs, redevelopment agency and related other. The court held that the eminent domain statutes allowing for values to be fixed at the date of declaration of blight rather than the date of filing the complaint were free of constitutional infirmity.</SPAN></P>

Defendant retorted loudly to the mayor's announcement at a basketball game and then continued with obscene language and gestures that disturbed others around him. The court held that the state could not unreasonably restrict personal freedoms, but that the state also must protect its citizens' rights to peaceful assembly free from riotous disturbances. The court concluded that the state presented sufficient, competent, and credible evidence to indicate that the totality of defendant's conduct in the bleachers was intentionally offensive and impinging on the rights of others. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:170-28 applied to any place of assembly, whether public or private and for whatever character.

The court held that the regulation prohibiting motorcycles on the expressway was not unconstitutional as being beyond the statutory power granted to the Authority. The court held that the regulation was not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment because the legislature delegated sufficient police powers to enable the Authority to carry out purposes for which it was created. The court concluded, however, that the regulation was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable in that it bore no relationship to the safety of persons using the expressway.

The court reversed the trespass charge because defendant's presence in the school's parking lot did not constitute a trespass, as his quiet and peaceful conduct were confined solely to one area of the school's parking lot. School property was of such a character that a mere entry thereon did not constitute a trespass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed a judgment of the trial court (New Jersey), which convicted them of fornication. They contended that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:110-1 was constitutionally invalid due to U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and alleged that the state failed to prove the resultant production of an illegitimate child and that the acts took place within the county of trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from their convictions for fornication. Defendants first contended that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:110-1 was constitutionally invalid because it unjustifiably interfered with defendants' right of privacy protected by U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The crime of fornication was on the statute books since 1796 and the legislative policy dealt with it as a crime against public morals. The state's interest was to prevent the birth of illegitimate children as well as to prevent illicit intercourse. The court had no authority to promulgate provisions of the Model Penal Code as the law of the state. Defendants asserted that their convictions should be reversed, because the state failed to prove the production of an illegitimate child. However, birth of issue was not a part of the crime. Defendants also argued that the state failed to prove that the alleged acts took place within the county wherein they were tried. However, crimes were offenses against the state rather than a territorial subdivision of it. Hence, as it appeared the offense was committed within the state, which inference was reasonably supported, there was no issue as to jurisdiction in the court. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' convictions for fornication were affirmed. It was for the legislature, not the courts, to change the law, if it chose to subscribe to a more liberal pattern of sex behavior. Defendants' arguments that the state had not proved the production of an illegitimate child or where the alleged acts occurred were without merit.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and found that N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 expressly provided for the presentment or indictment of a grand jury, and that a grand jury could call attention to public conditions within the county which in its view ought to have been remedied. The court further stated that N.J. Ct.

The court held that although appellant's comments that minimized illegal gambling were not indictable conduct, the grand jury's expression of opinion as to the effect of those comments was legitimate criticism. The court found that the trial court acted appropriately in not permitting a roving review of the grand jury minutes because no recommendations were specifically made about appellant.</SPAN></P>

Later, at the conclusion of the state's case, the proofs presented a fact question and the motion for dismissal was properly denied. The court found that there was no merit to defendant's contention that the failure to give him adequate notice of the charge against him amounted to a denial of due process.

The court rejected petitioner's argument that 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 381 inferentially invalidated the net worth portion of the tax because &sect; 381 only applied to taxes on or measured by net income and had no effect on the portion measured by allocated net worth.

The ordinance revised a prior ordinance which licensed and regulated mobile home parks. Plaintiffs had paid personal property taxes and a $ 100 annual license fee. Personal property taxes were eliminated by the legislature, and under the amended ordinance, plaintiffs paid a $ 500 annual license fee plus fees for each space; and, the size of lot spacing was regulated. The court affirmed and held that the power to license and regulate under the police power, and the power to raise revenue under the general power to tax, could be unitedly exercised; and, that the monthly fees were valid. The imposition of the fees did not constitute double taxation of real property. Further, the amended ordinance was not unconstitutionally retrospective; plaintiffs acquired no immunity from the exercise of the police power even if they had been in conformity with the former ordinance prior to the adoption of the revised ordinance.

He obtained journeymen electricians to do electrical work of various kinds called for under the plant maintenance agreement. Defendant did electrical work involving upkeep and calibration of machines and installation, replacement, removal and rerouting of electric power lines. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that because defendant's electricians did some installation work and they were not employees of the major oil company, the exemption under N.J. Stat.

There was no statutory exemption for installation, replacement, removal and rerouting of electrical power lines performed by defendant's electricians, which justified the failure to secure the required permit.

The court held, further, that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55-1.13 did not apply because the legislature authorized the project by N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a juvenile of 12 years of age. Therefore, defendant did not come within the provisions of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:4-15 which permitted a jury trial as of right for a juvenile of the age of 16 or 17 where the complaint was transferred to an adult court pursuant to the statute. The only way defendant could receive a jury trial was if it was conducted in the juvenile and domestic relations court. However, N.J. Stat. Ann &sect; 2A:4-35 provided that a juvenile and domestic relations court shall hear and determine all cases of children without a jury. The court denied defendant's motion for a jury trial. The statute had not been repealed and the court could not conclude that the statute was unconstitutional. Principles of statutory construction provided that the statute was presumed constitutional and that presumption was of even greater effect as applied to lower courts. A survey of the law concerning a juvenile's right to a trial by jury was mixed, with some states upholding statutes similar to the one at issue, and other states providing for jury trials for juveniles. In light of the unsettled law and the presumption of constitutionality, the court upheld the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that New Jersey was a signatory to the interstate compact to facilitate the return of parolees to the paroling state without the necessity of bringing formal extradition proceedings. The court held that New Jersey had not consented to defendant being allowed to reside in the state, nor had it assumed the duties of parole supervision over defendant. The court concluded that New Jersey was a receiving state for the purpose of return defendant to Louisiana as a parole violator because it was undisputed that defendant was found in New Jersey, and New Jersey was a signatory to the compact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his brother were arrested in connection with a shooting. A search revealed a gun in defendant's brother's pocket. Defendant appealed his conviction for carrying a firearm without a permit in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:151-41. Defendant testified that he was in a fight with a man outside a store, the man dropped a gun, defendant picked up the gun, and handed it to his brother. Defendant argued that his possession of the gun was instantaneous and his intention was not criminal. The court held that, although it was unclear how long defendant possessed the gun, the record indicated that he voluntarily took possession of it and made no effort to deliver it to the lawful owner or to the police authorities. The court further stated that defendant's participation in concealment the gun in his brother's pocket suggested a consciousness of possession and a designed control of the weapon. The court affirmed the conviction because the evidence was sufficient to support the finding that defendant possessed the weapon, and the trial court did not commit plain error in failing to instruct the jury as to the exceptions to &sect; 2A:151-41 or the legal concept of possession.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the weapon must be a rifle within the meaning of the statute at the time of his arrest and that it was immaterial that a firing pin or bolt could be obtained by him at a later time. The court denied the motion to dismiss the indictment under N.J. Ct. R. 3:5-5(b)(1), stating that, from an analysis of the prior procedural rules and the federal rule, Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(1), upon which N.J. Ct. R. 3:5-5(b)(1) was based, it was apparent that defendant could not raise his contention as a defense by motion before trial. The court was precluded before trial from entertaining testimony that contradicted the factual allegations of the indictment. Defendant could raise his defense only at trial. The only proper motion to the court, prior to submission of the case to the jury for its determination of whether the object was a rifle within the intendment of the statute, would be a motion for judgment of acquittal under N.J.

The court sustained the validity of ch. X-A and dissolved the stay that had been granted. It found that the procedures followed in promulgating the administrative regulation were legislative in nature and proper. The Department had been given broad powers to abate the air pollution menace to public health, and ch. X-A was within the scope of the legislative grant.

The court held that the Secondary Mortgage Loan Act of 1965, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:11A-1 et seq., was applicable to a secondary mortgage loan to New Jersey borrowers, secured by real property situated in the state, although the loan agreement was executed in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Pennsylvania lender was barred recovery of any part of a loan or interest, because the loan agreement called for interest in excess of that allowed by the Secondary Mortgage Loan Act of 1965, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:11A-1 et seq. Intervenor lender argued for prospective application of the court's decision, because it relied on the advice of counsel that the Act was not applicable to its loans. The court restricted retroactive application of its decision in relation to loans by licensed Pennsylvania lenders made prior to the effective date, where the loans comported with Pennsylvania law, the agreements were executed in that state, and the obligations were repayable there. The court found that the decision was to remain fully retroactive to lenders that could not reasonably have been advised in advance that choice of law and interstate commerce factors would immunize the loans from the effect of the Act. The court found that cases involving some degree of causal intermediation between the lender and the borrower by operatives functioning in the state should be appraised on the particular facts of the individual case for determination for relief from retroactivity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant township contended that the trial court's judgment erroneously invalidated an entire subsection of an ordinance, rather than just the offending provisions; and, that it was authorized to charge plaintiff developers a fee for inspecting improvements. The court agreed and modified the judgment. First, the judgment was beyond the scope of relief demanded by plaintiffs because it invalidated portions of the ordinance which were sanctioned by law, admittedly valid, and not challenged by plaintiffs. Because the ordinance contained a severability clause, only the provision requiring developers to pay inspection fees should have been stricken. Second, defendant was authorized pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:48-2 to provide by ordinance for the payment of reasonable inspection fees. Defendant also had implied authority under the Municipal Planning Act (1953), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55-1.1 et seq., to require the fees. However, the manner of fee collection in the challenged ordinance was void against public policy because it, in effect, required developers to pay an engineer directly and did not set a specific standard for determining the fee.</SPAN></P>

While a parole hearing could determine whether a person remained in confinement or was granted freedom, the court held the hearing was administrative, there was no adjudication of guilt or innocence, and ordinarily, no fact issues to be resolved that would require the presence of counsel. The court held there was no contention that defendant's case was unusual and distinguished a parole hearing from probation revocation where substantial rights could be affected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of counsel at public expense to assist defendant in making a plea for parole and affirmed the denial of parole for defendant because there was no need for an attorney at this hearing which was essentially administrative, did not adjudicate guilt or innocence, and did not ordinarily involve resolution of fact issues that would require the presence of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant voluntarily pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with having committed the crime of larceny from the person under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:119-1. He was sentenced to prison for a term of not less than six years, nor more than seven years. In addition, he was ordered to pay a fine of $ 2,000 and to stand committed until the fine was paid. Defendant took no direct appeal from the judgment of conviction. However, sometime later he applied for post-conviction relief, contending that the $ 2,000 fine violated the due process and equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The trial court entered an order denying defendant's application for post-conviction relief. The court affirmed the trial court's decision because the court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A: 166-16 provided that a person could be confined to prison by reason of default in the payment of a fine and the further confinement did not extend beyond the statutory jail limitation.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the dismissal, the court held that an action may not be maintained under the Death Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. 2A:31-1 et seq., on behalf of illegitimate children to recover for the alleged wrongful death of their putative father. The court observed that at common law an illegitimate child could not inherit from his putative father or mother. However, the legislature enacted N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3A:4-2, which allowed illegitimate children to inherit from the mother, but not the putative father. The court found that because an illegitimate child may not take by intestate succession from his father, he was precluded from maintaining a wrongful death action under &sect; 2A:31-4 when it is his father, rather than his mother, for whose death the tortfeasor is allegedly responsible.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city levied a tax on the personal property of respondent taxpayer on January 1, 1964, which was the assessing date for 1965 taxes pursuant to N.J.

Ann. &sect; 54:4-1, because the property was physically beyond the borders of the state before the calendar year 1965 began. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the assessment was valid because the legislature intended that property found in the taxing district on the statutory assessing date was taxable for the corresponding tax year even if subsequently removed. The tax was not unconstitutional on due process grounds because it was related to governmental services and protection which respondent received from appellant as of January 1, 1964, when the property was permanently situated in the state. Also, the state statutory scheme had long fixed assessing dates that antedated the commencement of the tax year and the time spread between the assessing date and the tax year was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a passenger in a car that the driver parked in a lot. The driver got out and started to break into a car at the lot. While attempting to drive away, the group was intercepted by police. Searches of the car revealed a rolled up coat hanger, a loaded pistol, and marijuana seeds. Traces of marijuana were found in a search of defendant's shirt pocket. The jury convicted defendant of breaking and entering with intent to steal, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:94-1, carrying a weapon in an automobile without first obtaining a permit to do so, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:151-41, and unlawful possession of a narcotic drug, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24:18-4. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the statutory presumption of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:151-7, that a firearm in a vehicle was presumed to be possessed by all of the car's occupants, was valid and could have been rebutted by defendant. The principles of aiding and abetting, that a person present at the commission of a crime without protest was equally as guilty, were properly charged to the jury. The amount of marijuana found on defendant's person was immaterial because it was illegal to possess any quantity.</SPAN></P>
