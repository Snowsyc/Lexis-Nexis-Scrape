The conciliation court awarded plaintiff $ 3,680 plus fees of $ 34. Defendant removed the case to district court. The district court reduced the conciliation court's award by more then $ 500. Defendant was entitled to recover costs under &sect; 491A.02(7)(b). However, the district court concluded that &sect; 491A.02(7)(b) was unconstitutional and against public policy. Instead of awarding costs in defendant's favor, the district court awarded costs to plaintiff. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the district court erred when it concluded that Minn.

The court noted that the district court did not identify any constitutional limitation violated by the legislative decision to assess responsibility for costs. The court further noted that the legislature was at liberty to ignore logic and perpetrate injustice so long as it does not transgress constitutional limits.

After the city filed an action to remove the docks, the property owners filed an application for an after-the-fact-variance from the ordinance. The board of adjustments found that the docks were not in the public interest and recommended that the variance be denied. The city subsequently denied the variance. The property owners claimed on appeal that their riparian rights were superior to the city's zoning authority, that the ordinance was preempted by the State's authority over water resource conservation, that the ordinance conflicted with State law governing wetlands, and that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The court rejected the property owners' claim. The court ruled that the ordinance was rationally related to the protection and preservation of wetlands, that there was no evidence that the city lacked authority to regulate the docks, that the city had express power to regulate the use of docks on navigable waters under Minn. Stat. &sect; 412.221(12) (1988), and that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were operators of adult bookstores. On appeal, they argued that the restrictions on adult bookstore windows set out in &sect; 540.410(g) were overbroad and improperly regulated the time, place, and manner of speech. The court held that &sect; 540.410(g) was a valid regulation on the time, place, and manner of speech. The ordinance was not void on its face as an overbroad restriction on free speech because it did not regulate the content of expression. Rather, it merely regulated the presentation of adult bookstore windows. The ordinance also served substantial government interests and provided ample alternative avenues of expression. The court further held that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions and that Minneapolis was not estopped from prosecuting defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ward appealed from the initial and final orders of the District Court, Anoka County (Minnesota), by which he was committed as a sexual psychopathic personality and a sexually dangerous person. Respondent State petitioned to commit him. Clear and convincing evidence was found at trial and the review hearing that he was both a sexual psychopathic person and a sexually dangerous person under Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18a-b (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ward was a 48-year-old white male with a family history indicative of pervasive sexual dysfunction. He also had a history of criminal sexual assaults. Violence and threats were involved in all of the incidents. He committed rape for which he was imprisoned for 15 years. He began a sex offender treatment program, but was uncooperative and was returned to prison. In anticipation of his release from prison, the State petitioned for his commitment under Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02 (1994). Clear and convincing evidence was found below that he was a sexually dangerous person. The court affirmed the order below for his commitment. After 15 years of incarceration and treatment, he kidnapped a woman. His conduct in committing that offense was strikingly similar to his prior sexual assaults. That his conduct was dangerous to other persons was particularly clear from the victims' testimony. Clear and convincing evidence established the statutory conditions for a sexual psychopathic personality and all experts agreed that he was highly likely to victimize again. Also, clear and convincing evidence showed that his commitment was the least restrictive alternative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with committing criminal sexual conduct, burglary, robbery, assault and kidnapping. He pleaded guilty to the robbery and assault charges and was sentenced to a 78-month executed commitment. While defendant was still in prison, his case manager informed him that he was required to register as a predatory offender pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166, subd. 1. Defendant filed a declaratory action, challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 243.166. The State filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that defendant's conviction arose from the same circumstances as the charged predatory offense and, therefore, defendant was required to register as a predatory offender. The trial court granted the motion, and defendant challenged the judgment. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that a factual record was necessary to determine whether defendant's sexual assault arose from the same set of circumstances as defendant's robbery and assault conviction. The court reasoned that the facts underlying the offense were also necessary for a constitutional challenge to &sect; 243.166. The court remanded for additional proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district employed ten Native American instructors. The instructors did not hold college degrees and were paid 12 percent less than teachers with degrees.

The trial court granted the district's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the instructors challenged the order. Additionally, an individual instructor challenged the order. The court noted that the order granting summary judgment was not supported by the memoranda. Specifically, the court explained that it could not determine the basis for the order. Because the record was inadequate for review purposes, the court remanded the cause for more specific findings and rationale. Next, the court noted that the only method of appealing a school board's decision on teacher related matters was by writ of certiorari.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant held up a store. Thereafter, the storeowner chased appellant, who drove away in a black car. Appellant was arrested after he was found lying injured next to the black car. At a pretrial hearing, appellant sought to suppress evidence obtained through a photo lineup where the storeowner identified him as the perpetrator. He claimed that the lineup was impermissibly suggestive because his photo's background color differed from the background color of the other photos. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court noted that a similar case had held that a lineup was not unconstitutional where the photo of the accused contained numbers in the background while the other photos did not. The court held that fine differences, such as background numbers or colors did not rise to the level of suggestive necessary to render a lineup unconstitutional. Further, the court found that the record contained ample evidence that appellant was the burglar. As such, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 609.561, subd. 1 (1990) and defrauding an insurer under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.611, subd. 1(b) (1990).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A fire occurred at defendant's family residence when the home was in foreclosure. During the course of defendant's trial, the jury toured defendant's burned home. Defendant was subsequently convicted of arson and insurance fraud. The court affirmed, holding that defendant was not denied his due process rights when the jury's viewing of the home did not strictly comply with the procedures outlined in Minn. R. Crim. P. 26.03, subd. 10, where a court reporter was not present. Because defendant did not object to the viewing at trial, the court reviewed under a plain error analysis. The court found that defense counsel's approval of the viewing procedure, presence during the entire viewing procedure, and lack of any issues raised at the site by either party satisfied the common sense reasons for having a court reporter at a viewing site. Defendant's allegation regarding the alleged improper search and seizure of his home was untimely. Defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial because he was convicted two years after the fire occurred. There was no error in refusing defendant's request for a change in venue.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not report the accident. The girl's mother found her lying near a driveway. A reconstruction specialist ascertained that the vehicle pieces at the scene came from a 1983 Chevrolet Silverado. The officers confirmed that defendant visited a bar that evening and that he owned a Chevrolet pickup. The officers drove to defendant's residence where, with defendant's consent, looked at his truck, and finding front-end damage, seized the vehicle. Defendant told an officer that he hit the girl. Defendant was charged with two counts of criminal vehicular homicide. Defendant was convicted. His sentence was in excess of the presumptive sentence under the statutory guidelines. Defendant appealed. The court held that the evidence indicated that defendant was negligent and that such evidence was sufficient to sustain his conviction for criminal vehicular operation. The trial court did not err in departing from the presumptive sentence under the statutory guidelines. Defendant's flight from the scene of the crime and the emotional impact of the incident on the victim's family supported the departure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant casino customer tried to sit on a chair in front of a slot machine at respondent tribal casino, the chair snapped, and she fell to the floor. The casino customer filed an action against the tribal casino and alleged that the fall caused injuries that required hospitalization. The casino customer challenged the decision of the District Court, Scott County (Minnesota), which dismissed her personal injury action for want of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that because the tribe created, owned, and controlled the tribal casino to further the legitimate governmental purpose of raising and redistributing revenue for the welfare of the tribe, the tribal casino was entitled to assert the tribe's sovereign immunity. The tribal casino's operation of a gaming hall did not waive sovereign immunity because the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C.S, &sect;&sect; 2701-2721, did not waive sovereign immunity for actions for money damages. The court held that the appointment of an agent for the service of process and the registration as a foreign corporation waived only personal jurisdiction defenses, not sovereign immunity. The court held that 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1360(a) was inapplicable to tribal corporate entities that were equivalent to the tribe for purposes of sovereign immunity. Because the events giving rise to the cause of action transpired wholly within the reservation, state court jurisdiction would infringe on tribal self-governance. Thus, the court lacked authority to hear the merits of the action. The court held that the casino customer was not denied due process because she was only deprived of her day in the court of her choice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that dismissed the casino customer's action because the tribal casino could assert the tribe's sovereign immunity, no federal statute authorized state jurisdiction over the action and state court jurisdiction would infringe on tribal self-governance. By dismissing the action for want of jurisdiction, the trial court did not violate the casino customer's right to due process.</SPAN></P>

In a prior order upon respondent State's petition, the district court had committed him for a 60-day evaluation. After a hearing to review the evaluation period, the district court made his commitment indefinite.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ward claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support his commitment. He sexually assaulted at least ten minor victims. The assaults spanned a period of approximately 30 years. He had been convicted of alcohol and drug offenses. Also, he had pled guilty to six counts of criminal sexual conduct. The district court found, inter alia, that his conduct displayed an utter lack of control. The court affirmed the order below, as clear and convincing evidence supported his commitment as a sexual psychopathic personality and a sexually dangerous person under Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subds. 18a, 18b (1994 and Supp. 1995). A habitual course of sexual misconduct was evident in his convictions of criminal sexual conduct. He committed hundreds of sexual assaults on at least ten young boys using threats and force to commit such acts. The criminal acts to which he pled guilty created a rebuttable presumption that he engaged in harmful sexual misconduct, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 7a(b), which he did not rebut. The expert testimony further buttressed the finding of his utter lack of control. Also, he refused treatment. Thus, he remained a danger to young boys.</SPAN></P>

Rather than jeopardize public safety with the convict on parole, the State and the county obtained his commitment by the trial court as a sexually dangerous person pursuant to Minn.

A jury impaneled to try the dairy farmer for practicing medicine without a license in violation of &sect; 147.081, subd. 3(3) deadlocked. The lower court certified the question of whether &sect; 147.081, subd. 3(3) was unconstitutionally vague such that it violated the Constitutions of the United States and Minnesota.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mental inmate was convicted of criminal sexual conduct and kidnapping in relation to an incident in which he abducted two 13-year-old children, raped the girl, forced the boy to perform sex acts, and ultimately killed the girl. The trial court ordered a psychiatric evaluation, as a result of which the inmate was committed as a psychiatric personality. Seventeen years after commitment the inmate petitioned the commissioner for discharge and also filed a writ of habeas corpus that challenged his commitment. The trial court dismissed the petition. The court held that all required factors for commitment were demonstrated in the criminal proceeding. The court held that the inmate's behavior exhibited a habitual course of misconduct in sexual matters, utter lack of power to control sexual impulses, and that he was a danger to others. In affirming the judgment the court held that commitment did not violate double jeopardy rights because commitment was remedial and was not for preventative detention.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 325D.44(1). The violation stemmed from solicitation of advertising for appellants' directory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, directory publisher and president, solicited advertising for their directory, which was a business-to-business directory and which was not distributed to customers. Respondent attorney general sued appellants for deceptive sales practices under various state laws including the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 325D.44(1). The trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of respondent that included an imposition of a civil penalty on appellants and a cease and desist directive. Appellants sought review in the court, and the court reversed in part and affirmed in part but upheld that directive and penalty. The court concluded that the trial court properly granted summary judgment. The court examined the 10 sales techniques utilized by appellants including using the term Yellow Pages and printing of the solicitations on yellow paper. The trial court had concluded from these undisputed techniques that the direct mail solicitations and invoices of appellants taken as a whole created the overall impression that recipient businesses were being solicited for yellow page advertising in their area telephone directory.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court did not err in using a tendency to deceive standard in applying an applicable state act and ruled that the standard was not invalid and that the applicable act was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

The district court ruled that double jeopardy barred the criminal prosecution because of a prior civil administrative forfeiture of property found in proximity to the controlled substances seized from defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police stopped defendant's vehicle because it matched a description of a vehicle involved in a &quot;shots fired&quot; call earlier. In a search of defendant's vehicle, drugs were found. Defendant's vehicle, jewelry, and other items were seized, and he was provided with a &quot;Notice of Seizure and Intent to Forfeit Property&quot; form. Defendant did not demand judicial review of the administrative forfeiture. Subsequently criminal drugs charges were filed. The trial court dismissed the criminal complaint on double jeopardy grounds. The court reversed and remanded for trial. The court held that the double jeopardy clause protected against multiple punishments for the same offense. The court held defendant had the burden of proof to show that a civil remedy was punitive for purposes of invoking the double jeopardy clause. The court held that an administrative forfeiture was &quot;remedial&quot; in nature. Thus, the court concluded that the stipulation of forfeiture that defendant entered into was not in the form of a judgment and that jeopardy did not attach because defendant did not subject himself to risk of punishment or guilt.</SPAN></P>

The boat club answered and filed various counter claims, including a permissive counterclaim. It did not assert arbitration as an affirmative defense. Shortly before trial was to commence, the boat club filed a motion to compel arbitration. The trial court held that the boat club had waived its right to arbitrate the dispute, and the boat club appealed. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, holding that the boat club was required to assert arbitration as a defense at the onset of the litigation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by police solely because the car she drove bore WX plates, which indicated that the plates were specially issued by the Commissioner of Public Safety pursuant to Minn.

After the trooper stopped defendant, he learned that her driver's license had been revoked after a driving under the influence charge, and the plates, issued because of her husband's conduct, had been revoked after defendant's conviction for driving without insurance. The court determined that when the trooper stopped defendant, he entertained only the general suspicion that some drivers would have misused the special license privilege. The court explained that because the trooper stopped defendant's car solely pursuant to his policy of stopping every VX or VY car, he did not have the required suspicion for making the stop. The court noted that the policy of routinely stopping all such vehicles constituted a violation of the constitutional requirement that vehicles could not have been stopped absent particularized police suspicion.

Although courts could engage in a broad inquiry of statutes whose language produced an absurd result, this authority could only be exercised sparingly and where a statute's plain language violated the legislature's expressed goal. The trustee challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 169.685, subd. 4 under Minn. Const. art.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 343.22, 343.235, 343.29, and filed a request for attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In denying the request for fees, the district court concluded that the city's conduct had nothing to do with the constitutional infirmities alleged; that the city had not violated the organizations' due process rights; and that the organizations' lawsuit had only challenged &quot;anticipatory enforcement&quot; of the challenged provisions. On review, the court affirmed, holding that the organizations had properly asserted a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim, as required for a fee award under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, but that the city was not liable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for merely following state law. A local government could only be held liable if, under color of some official policy, it cause the violation of another's constitutional rights. A municipality must make a deliberate choice to follow a course of action from among various alternatives to sustain &sect; 1983 liability. In this case, the city was limited to following now invalidated state law to achieve certain enforcement objectives. The city's policy was innocuous and constitutionally permissible and its causal connection to the alleged violation was more attenuated than a policy of enforcing state law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four years after the bar owners obtained an injunction prohibiting the county from enforcing an ordinance prohibiting nudity in liquor establishments on the ground that the ordinance violated Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3, the county moved to vacate the injunction based on a subsequent state supreme court decision holding an identical ordinance constitutional. The trial court granted the county's motion and vacated the injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The county's action seeking to have the injunction vacated was not barred by res judicata. The precedent established by the state supreme court constituted a sufficient change in legal circumstances to warrant relief from the injunction. Under the trial court's equitable powers and under Minn. R. Civ. P. 60.02(e), it retained jurisdiction to vacate the injunction. The decision in the state supreme court case was controlling at the trial level. The county had the authority to restrict nudity in liquor establishments pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. 21. Under state law, that authority existed notwithstanding the free speech provision of Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Hennepin County (Minnesota) certified two questions raising constitutional challenges to the new extended jurisdiction juvenile statute and to the new presumption of certification applied in certain juvenile delinquency proceedings, Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 260.125, subd. 2a, 260.126, subd. 1(2), in two juvenile actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitions were filed against two juveniles for various criminal conduct. The trial court presented consolidated certified questions to the appeals court: (1) Is the provision in Minn.

(2) Does the prosecutor-designated extended jurisdiction juvenile provision violate the separation of powers? (3) Does the presumptive certification statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 260.125, subd. 2a, violate equal protection? (4) Does the presumptive certification statute violate due process by creating a mandatory irrebuttable presumption of certification? (5) Does the presumptive certification statute violate due process by placing on the juvenile the burden of persuasion? The court concluded that the statutes were constitutional and answered the consolidated certified questions in the negative. The court noted that the statutory criteria are very specific and neither vague nor conducive to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The court also found that the limited prosecutor-designated extended jurisdiction juvenile provision did not violate the separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, finding that the statute afforded the city no greater immunity than that enjoyed by private landowners, thus it created no inequality and the citizen's equal protection challenge, made on the basis of Minn. Stat. art. I, &sect; 2, failed. The court held that because private citizens enjoyed no common law remedy for injuries caused by governmental acts, such as the maintenance of public recreational facilities, the municipal park immunity statute did not violate Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court held that while a defendant's alleged breach of tort duties often presented a question of fact for the jury, the trial court could grant summary judgment if the plaintiff failed to offer any specific facts to support an element of the claim, thus, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the city.</SPAN></P>

Although the driver was convicted for only the failure to provide proof of insurance, he claimed that &sect; 169.791 and the compulsory insurance requirement of Minn. Stat. &sect; 65B.42, .48 did not unconstitutionally infringed upon his right to travel. The right to travel was a fundamental right under the federal constitution; however, the court did not find that the requirement to provide proof of insurance implicated the right to intrastate travel, as it affected only one mode of transportation. Moreover, the statute affected motor vehicle owners and permitted non-owners 10 days to provide the identity and address of the owner. Nor did the compulsory insurance requirement deny the driver equal protection of the laws by creating two classes of persons: those who could afford insurance and those who could not, as even if the law was not rationally related to a legitimate state interest, the driver was admittedly in a high-risk category because of a DWI conviction, a classification that resulted from his own actions.</SPAN></P>

The City refused to initiate eminent domain proceedings to obtain a permanent water drainage easement. The landowner sued. The trial court granted its motion for summary judgment and a writ of mandamus. The City appealed. The landowner sought counsel fees on appeal under Minn. Stat. &sect; 117.045 (1994). The court affirmed finding that notice of the taking was a critical factor in determining whether a party had standing to pursue a condemnation claim. The court noted that the landowner was the owner at the time that the City changed its use from a trespass/nuisance into a permanent drainage easement. The court held that counsel fees on appeal were not provided for in the statute.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 466.03, subd. 6(e) (1994), the recreational immunity statute. The court first ruled that the city owed no duty to the injured party as a potential trespasser because no claim was asserted that a dangerous condition existed that necessitated that the city have taken preventative steps. Because the injured party's claim was one exclusively in negligence, the court held that the matter fit squarely under &sect; 466.03, subd. 6(e), which provided immunity to the city for the negligent operation of a municipal park by one of their employees. The court also held that under the rational basis test, &sect; 466.03, subd. 6(e) was not a violation of the Equal Protection Clause because the shield provided to the city from potentially huge tort liability was rationally related to the purpose of &quot;the preservation of Minnesota's outdoor recreational resources.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The motorist moved to dismiss the appeal, to strike the references in the Commissioner's brief to excluded evidence, and for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer stopped to assist the motorist, whose car was parked on the side of the road with the hood raised. The officer detected an odor of alcohol and saw empty beer cans in the vehicle. The officer asked where the motorist had come from and whether he had been drinking; the motorist answered that he had come from home and that he had been drinking. A breathalyzer test indicated that the motorist's alcohol concentration was .10 or more. The Commissioner revoked the motorist's license pursuant to &sect; 169.123. The trial court concluded that the motorist was in custody when the officer initially questioned the motorist and that, because no Miranda warnings were given, the motorist's answers to the questions and all evidence of intoxication observed by the officer had to be suppressed; accordingly, the trial court rescinded the revocation of the motorist's license. On appeal, the court reversed. There was no need for the officer to have a reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal activity when he stopped to assist the motorist. Assuming that Miranda warnings were required, sufficient evidence apart from the motorist's answers existed to warrant administration of intoxication tests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and reinstated the revocation of the motorist's driving privileges. The court denied the motorist's motion to dismiss the appeal, to strike the references in the Commissioner's brief to excluded evidence, and for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees worked for the cooperative school district until its dissolution. The cooperative school district provided special education services to six member school districts, including the district the employees brought their action against. Anticipating the cooperative school district's dissolution, the district passed two companion resolutions on the posting of non-licensed positions for a certain school year. The employees brought their action after the district under its collective bargaining agreement with the union allowed only union members to bid on the four positions that the employees claimed were created as a result of the dissolution. On review, the court overturned the district's decision and remanded. The court held that, because Minn. Stat. &sect; 122.895, subd. 8 (1994) allowed the employees to bid for positions created as a result of the dissolution of a cooperative in the order of their seniority within the dissolved cooperative, the district's posting process violated their rights. The court ruled that reversal was warranted when a school district has either failed to show a substantial basis in the record or had misapplied the applicable law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with two counts of first degree criminal sexual conduct and one count of kidnapping. Defendant pleaded guilty to one count of first degree criminal sexual conduct in exchange for the dismissal of the other charges and the State's agreement not to seek an upward departure of more than 1.5 times the presumptive sentence. At the time of the plea bargain, the parties believed that appellant's criminal history score was two and that the departure sought by the State would lead to a 165-month sentence. At the sentencing hearing, it was determined that appellant's criminal history score was three. Appellant was given the opportunity to withdraw his plea but he did not do so and he was sentenced to 183 months' imprisonment. On direct appeal, the court affirmed. On appeal from the denial of appellant's motion for postconviction relief, the court affirmed. Appellant's plea was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. Appellant's medical records did not show that his plea was involuntary; rather, they indicated that he did not suffer from any mental incapacity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with harassing his estranged wife, which for him was a felony because he had earlier been convicted of violating his wife's order for protection.

On appeal he claimed that the statute violated his First Amendment and due process rights. The court affirmed the judgment, ruling that defendant failure to argue to overbreadth or due process claims at trial waived the issues on appeal, particularly given his guilty plea. The court ruled that despite a valid guilty plea, a person was able to argue on appeal that the charge was one that the State had no constitutional right to prosecute. Defendant, however, chose to plead guilty to violating &sect; 609.749, subds. 2(4). That section defined an act and did not directly involve speech. He also agreed to a dismissal of the intent to injure charge under &sect; 609.749, subd. 2(1) (1994).

The officer testified that he believed the placement and number of the headlamps on defendant's motorcycle was illegal.

The district court awarded summary judgment to the unions and president on the basis that some of the actions had abated at the worker's death. The administrator appealed. The court affirmed. The claims for breach of contract, tortious interference with a contract and unfair representation had survived the worker's death. Because the assault and emotional distress claims were injuries to the worker's person, those claims had abated under Minn. Stat. &sect; 573.02, subd. 2 (1994). The underlying acts of transfer, harassment, and assault on the unfair representation claim were not bargaining subjects and the worker failed to follow the reporting procedures. The breach of contract claim based upon union constitutions that had no provision for the monetary damages claimed was not viable. As parties to the contract, the unions were not liable for tortious interference and the claim was not viable against the president because essential element of damages was missing.

The district court declined to apply the 1994 amendments to the juvenile reference statute and decided to refer appellant, alleged to have committed first-degree criminal sexual conduct in violation of Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court denied appellant's request to proceed under the 1994 amendments on the basis that the amended statute could be applied only to offenses occurring on or after January 1, 1995, the statute's effective date. Appellant allegedly committed the offense on December 21, 1994, and a juvenile delinquency petition was filed on January 11, 1995. The court held that the district court should have applied the 1994 amendments to appellant's case, rather than the unamended 1992 juvenile statute and rules. Both Minn. Stat. &sect; 260.125, subd. 1 (1994), the new certification procedure, and Minn. Stat. &sect; 260.126, subd. 1 (1994), the Extended Jurisdiction Juvenile (EJJ) process, stated that it was the &quot;proceeding,&quot; rather than the alleged violation, that was to be certified or designated. The legislature's consistent reference to &quot;proceeding&quot; indicated that the relevant date for determining whether the amendments applied was the date juvenile proceedings were commenced. Appellant knowingly and voluntarily waived his protection against the ex post facto application of the new law, and no policy reasons existed for denying appellant the right to waive that constitutional protection.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's 180-day driver's license revocation for failing an intoxilyzer test, a civil sanction, did not constitute punishment and therefore did not bar his subsequent criminal prosecution for the same incident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that his civil sanction for driving while under the influence of alcohol, a 180-day revocation of his driver's license imposed after he failed an intoxilyzer test, constituted punishment and barred his subsequent criminal prosecution for the same incident. The court noted that Minnesota courts rejected defendant's argument that a remedy that was not solely remedial was punishment. The court held that defendant's case was an example of the all too common case in which a driver who repeatedly endangered the lives and well-being of others by driving while intoxicated was merely deprived of the privilege to drive for a six-month period. The court stated that the civil penalty was rationally related to the State's interest in protecting the public from impaired drivers. The court affirmed the judgment, as it found that the fact that the civil remedy could in some instances deter drunken driving or inconvenience those to whom it was applied did not render it punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause.</SPAN></P>

At first, the landowner's variance request was denied. However, the municipality later granted the landowner's applications for conveyances. Thereafter, the municipality denied several of the landowner's applications to convey land. The municipality also conditioned approval of the landowner's request for vacation of an easement on his payment of funds to the municipality. The landowner then filed an action against the municipality. The trial court granted summary judgment to the landowner on his equal protection claims and on his taking and substantive due process claims and granted summary judgment to the municipality on all other claims. On appeal, the court determined that the municipality did not take a portion of the landowner's property because the property was dedicated for public use. Also, the court found that the landowner's equal protection rights were not violated because the municipality could condition its vacation of an easement on a cash payment by the landowner. Therefore, the court concluded that that the municipality should have been granted summary judgment on all issues.</SPAN></P>

The mother was killed in a car accident one month after the other man was adjudicated the child's father. He took custody of the girl and moved the court for sole custody. The trial court found that the putative father lacked standing to bring a paternity action and rejected the child's request for blood tests on the grounds that she failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.

The administrators showed department heads the proposed organizational plans exhibiting the one department for parks and recreation and the community center. The administrator recommended that the director of community center be appointed as the director of the new department because he had experience in managing an arena. Before the issue came to the city council for a vote, the administrator discussed the recommendation with the council members individually. The administrator sent the employee a letter informing him of the layoff. The council voted to adopt the planned merger and the layoff of the employee. The employee appealed.

The court affirmed because the statute was rationally related to a legitimate state interest, the safety of motorists, and it did not violate the equal protections clause. In addition, appellants' right to reduce a judgment against them was no less importation than the government's interest in maintaining efficient trial procedure by avoiding complicating trials with expert-witness testimony on the mitigating effects of seat-belt use; therefore, appellants' due process claim also failed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy; an officer could see clearly into the booth and a sign was posted warning of police surveillance. Defendant argued that the ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad because it was aimed at expressive conduct. The court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutional on its face. Fondling one's unclothed genitals in a public place was not protected expressive conduct. Defendant's co-defendant had pleaded guilty to indecent conduct under the ordinance. The court held that the erroneous admission his conviction constituted prejudicial error.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate, who was committed as a psychopathic personality while confined at a correctional facility, sought an immediate transfer to a security hospital, or, alternatively, an order requiring the Commissioner of Corrections and the Commissioner of Human Services to offer a treatment program at the correctional facility. On appeal, the court affirmed judgment denying the inmate's motion and ordering that the inmate be transferred to the security hospital upon the completion of his prison sentence. The court found that the inmate's challenges to the constitutionality of the psychopathic personality statute were merely restatements of arguments that had been previously rejected. The immediate transfer of the inmate to the security hospital was not possible because Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.185, subd. 2(b) provided that the criminal sentence had to first be served in the correctional facility. The court held that the inmate's request for treatment at the correctional facility was premature and that the claim would be ripe only when the inmate's release from prison was relatively imminent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole director and officer of the business was the former president of and a director for the company, which had filed for bankruptcy. When his wife filed for reemployment insurance benefits with the Department, a field auditor conducted an audit of the business, who determined that there was substantial evidence that the business was the successor employer to the company and that the company's rating record was to be transferred to the business. Ultimately, that determination was affirmed. On appeal, the court ruled that substantial evidence, such as the facts that business used the company's name in the phone book used the corporate and trade names that the company had used, supported the finding that the business acquired the organization, trade, or business of the company, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 268.06, subd. 22(a). The evidence, that the two operations were both engaged in printing and that the business hired many of the company's employees, supported the finding that the business continued the company's business. Finally, the court ruled that the Department's combination of investigative and decision-making functions in did not violate the business's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

Eventually, he pled guilty to five counts of criminal misconduct in the third degree. After he was scheduled for release from prison, a petition for his commitment as a psychopathic personality was filed. A court-appointed examiner testified that appellant was a pedophile who displayed both control and impulsivity. Accordingly, the trial court committed him to a state security hospital for an indeterminate sentence. On review, appellant argued that there was insufficient evidence to show that he had an utter lack of power to control his sexual impulses or that he was likely to inflict serous physical or mental harm in the future. The court found that his actions showed that he had no will to stop sexually assaulting adolescent males and that he had no remorse. Rather, appellant was convinced that he had provided a service to the young men. Thus, the court found that the evidence showed appellant's complete lack of control. Further, the court noted that the victims suffered physically and psychologically from the incidents and that appellant was likely to be similarly dangerous in the future.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the police officer had probable cause because the motorist was sitting in the driver's seat with an open container of alcohol on the dashboard and that her breath smelled of alcohol. The court held that the motorist's contention that she had no intention of driving at the time was irrelevant because under the totality of the circumstances, the officer had probable cause to believe the motorist was in physical control of her car while under the influence. The court also ruled that because the motorist had not offered evidence to rebut the officer's testimony that her refusal to submit to the breath test was based on insufficient grounds, she had lost her right to prove that her refusal was based on reasonable grounds as an affirmative defense pursuant to Minn.

The employee alleged employment discrimination and, after lengthy and expensive discovery, the employer made a settlement offer to the employee, which was rejected. Subsequently a judgment was rendered in favor of the employer. The trial court granted the employer motion, pursuant to Minn. R. Civ. P. 68, to recover its costs from the employee. The employee asserted that Minn. R. Civ. P. 68 violated the state and federal constitutions and that he was entitled to relief for &quot;financial hardship&quot; under Minn.

The court held that the application of the rule had no &quot;chilling effect&quot; on individuals who challenged unlawful employment discrimination practices but rather promoted the judicial goal of encouraging settlement of disputes. The court held that the statutory &quot;financial hardship&quot; exception was inapplicable because costs were not awarded under the statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company entered into lease agreements to erect billboards. A city ordinance required removal of nonconforming billboards as a condition of land development. When the lessors expressed an interest in developing their land, the company removed the signs. The company's later applications for replacement billboards were refused. The company brought an action against the city for damages, a declaration of its rights, and initiation of condemnation proceedings. The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. Although property rights in outdoor advertising devices were entitled to the protections of the Takings Clause, the company was not entitled to compensation because the property owners terminated the company's leasehold interests. The leasehold interests were not altered by the ordinance. Assuming the sign ordinance effected a taking, the company had no compensable interest in the properties because it agreed in advance to termination of its leasehold rights upon development of the land. The company had no vested right to construct replacement billboards under a repealed ordinance because there was no vested right in zoning matters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was serving a sentence for criminal sexual conduct, the state legislature passed the sex offender registration law, Minn.

Defendant claimed that applying the law to a felon who was convicted before it took effect violated the ex post facto prohibitions of the United States and Minnesota Constitutions. Defendant moved for dismissal on that basis. The lower court denied the motion and found defendant guilty. Defendant appealed his conviction. On appeal, the court noted that the law applied to offenders released from prison after the effective date of the statute regardless of the date of the offense. The court considered whether the legislature intended the law to punish an offender for a past act, or whether the restriction of the individual was incidental to the regulation of a present situation.

On appeal, defendant contended that (1) the trial court erred by ruling that the state could use prior felony convictions to impeach him; (2) the prosecution's introduction of a witness's hearsay statements constituted prosecutorial misconduct; (3) the career offender statute was void for vagueness; and (4) the trial court erred when it sentenced him under the &quot;career offender&quot; statute. The court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of defendant's prior convictions because the prior convictions all occurred within the previous seven years. The court also ruled that the prosecution's admission of a witness' hearsay statements did not constitute prosecutorial misconduct because the decision whether to admit or exclude evidence rested with the trial court, and the evidence was admissible under the &quot;catch-all&quot; exception to the hearsay rule, Minn. R. Evid. 803(24). The court held that the career offender statute, including its definition of a &quot;career offender,&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The court also denied the officer's motion to expunge his vacated criminal convictions from the official records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer alleged that his termination violated the Equal Protection Clause and the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in the Eighth Amendment because other officers that were found guilty of unbecoming conduct were not terminated. The court affirmed the district court's judgment, concluding that substantial evidence supported the civil service board's approval of the termination and that the officer received all of the due process to which he was entitled. The court also reasoned that the officer's unbecoming conduct provided a rational basis for his termination. The court further held that the officer could not have prevailed under Minn. R. Civ. P. 60.02(e) or (f) because he did not show that a present challenge to the board's determination would have had merit and that vacating the criminal convictions did not entitle him to relief due to the ample evidence that the board's decision was not based on those convictions. The court also found that not adhering to the specificity requirements that precedent established as to the expungement of the criminal records justified not granting that relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the District Court, Brown County (Minnesota), defendant pled guilty to the sale of marijuana, a fifth degree controlled substance crime, and to sale of 10 or more dosage units of LSD, a third degree controlled substance crime. He appealed a $ 50,000 fine on the LSD conviction and $ 250 surcharge on the marijuana conviction and argued that the surcharge statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.101, subd. 1(b), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the marijuana charge, the district court also stayed imposition of the sentence, placed defendant on probation for five years, ordered him to serve 45 days in the county jail, fined him $ 750, and assessed a $ 25 felony criminal surcharge. On the LSD charge, the district court also stayed the presumptive 21-month prison sentence and ordered defendant to spend six months in the county jail, to be on probation for 20 years. Also on the LSD charge the district court waived the mandatory surcharge on the $ 50,000 fine but imposed a $ 25 felony criminal surcharge. On appeal, the court pointed out that the minimum fine for conviction of a third degree controlled substance crime was $ 50,000. The court noted that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.101, subd. 5 implied some discretion as to reduction of a fine, but the court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion by not doing so in defendant's case. The State conceded that the $ 250 surcharge, 33 1/3 percent of the fine, was error, and the court modified the surcharge to $ 150, the 20 percent permissible. Finally, the court held that defendant had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 609.101, subd. 1(b).</SPAN></P>

The boy displayed various symptoms related to juvenile-onset diabetes which could have been treated even up to within two hours of his death. The Christian Scientists who cared for him failed to seek medical attention and he died. The district court found for the trustee and an appeal followed. The court affirmed as to some parties and reversed as to others. The court found that punitive damages should not have been awarded against defendant church and held it was unconstitutional to have imposed punitive damages on a church to force it to abandon teaching its central tenet. The court upheld the award of compensatory damages because the state's interest in protecting children outweighed the free exercise of religion. The court found those individuals who were directly involved and had a duty of care for the boy could be held liable but those who were not directly involved had no duty of care and were not liable.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed defendant's misdemeanor conviction and held that defendant's on-site preparations were not prohibited by the ordinance. The court found that the terms of the ordinance were not defined and did not include the on-site preparation work done by defendant. As such, the court construed the ordinance in favor of lenity and concluded that defendant's work preparation duties were not covered under the ordinance. Also, the court ruled that defendant's activities were not covered by the ordinance merely because they were essential to the installation of the sprinkler system. The court held that the application of the ordinance by the municipality only to on-site work while exempting identical work off-site unreasonably treated similarly situated persons differently and violated due process and equal protection rights.

Stat. &sect; 627.01, subds. 1 and 2 venue was properly had in any county in which an element of the crime was committed. The court rejected defendant's contention that the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct by calling defendant's wife as a witness, noting that defendant's assertion of marital privilege was not discussed in front of the jury, that the State did not attempt to draw any inference from the wife's failure to testify, and the trial court had given an appropriate cautionary instruction. The court found that any error in the trial court's evidentiary rulings was harmless, noting that police testimony concerning statements made by the wife was consistent with defendant's trial testimony and that testimony concerning statements made by defendant before he was Mirandized had not contradicted his trial testimony.</SPAN></P>

Respondent, a consumer alliance, had filed a complaint with the Commission raising the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission previously ordered the company to adopt the cost allocation principles of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Later, upon the alliance's complaint that the company failed to properly implement that order, the Commission ordered the instant contested case proceeding on allocation issues. The alliance alleged, inter alia, that the company used the goodwill of its regulated utility operations to subsidize its unregulated appliance sales business. The Commission ruled that such goodwill should be treated as an asset. Thus, the Commission imputed as revenue to the utility the value of its goodwill in the unregulated market for purposes of setting rates. The court agreed and affirmed the Commission's order, as it was supported by substantial evidence. Record evidence showed that the goodwill of the regulated utility had value in the competitive market. The Commission had the statutory authority for rate-making purposes to impute as revenue to a utility's regulated operations the value of its goodwill as to its unregulated operations, where such imputation was necessary to avoid a subsidy to the company.

The beneficiaries had brought an action in equity, in which judgment was also granted to respondents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the basis for their malpractice claim against the trustee's agent, the beneficiaries asserted that the agent, an attorney, had conflicts of interest between the beneficiaries and the trustee during the years 1978-1984 and that the agent failed to inform the beneficiaries of the conflict. The agent had written the trust instrument in 1917 and had represented the trustee since then. The trustee's agent had represented the beneficiaries in prior litigation. Because there was not a substantial relevant relationship or overlap between the subject matters of the representation of two clients, there could be no liability for legal malpractice for failing to inform one client about the representation of the other client. Because the previous litigation was not substantially related to the issues raised in the trust litigation, the trustee's agent had no duty to inform the beneficiaries of his representation of the trustee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that it was an abuse of discretion to revoke his probation, that the revocation was unconstitutional, and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at the revocation hearing. In remanding the decision, the court found that the postconviction court failed to make any findings of fact or conclusions of law. Further, neither the revocation court nor the postconviction court made the required Austin findings. Defendant filed a motion for postconviction relief, which stated that it was based upon a petition for postconviction relief and two affidavits, all of which were attached to the motion. The postconviction court denied defendant's motion, but did not refer to the petition. It was not clear whether the postconviction court ever actually ruled on the postconviction petition. However, certain documents from defendant's brief and appendix, and all references to them were stricken from the record because they were not properly part of the record on appeal. Finally, defendant's motion for sanctions was denied because there was no evidence of bad faith in the State's motion to correct the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The university decided to make its new recreational center available to the public for a modest fee because it was built with taxpayer dollars and community funding. Appellants alleged that in anticipation of the opening, non-student members did not join their club, and they were forced to close. In affirming the decision, the court held thatappellants were precluded from any relief because they failed to establish, beyond mere conjecture and speculation, that the university's sale of memberships to the public caused them to go out of business. Further, the sales were not unconstitutional because the university's action of providing public access to the center served the public purpose of promoting public health. The court also found that the university did not exceed its authority by engaging in a private enterprise because the public access to the center was limited and the modest fee generated minimal income. There was no evidence that the university's objective was to interfere with appellants' business and thus, the claim of tortious interference failed. Finally, because appellants did not bring a mandamus action, their taking claim was not properly before the district court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision, which granted summary judgment to the university.</SPAN></P>

On September 24, 1993, following a dismissal, the State filed its second complaint. Defendant first appeared on October 18, filed a written demand for a speedy trial, and the trial court appointed a public defender. At the November 22 omnibus hearing, defendant's second public defender requested a continuance and agreed to modify defendant's demand for a speedy trial. Defendant next appeared on December 13, this time pro se. The trial began on January 4, 1994. Defendant represented himself, with standby counsel present in the courtroom. On appeal, defendant argued that his waiver of counsel was not knowing and voluntary, and that he did not receive a speedy trial. The court held that: (1) the trial court had implicitly found defendant's waiver valid in granting his request for self-representation; (2) defendant's conversations with public defenders helped show that he was aware of the consequences of proceeding pro se; and (3) defendant was tried within 60 days after his prospective reassertion of his speedy trial demand as required by Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owner sought to expand his business to include nude dancers. The city did not respond to the business owner's request until some 71 days after receipt of the application. The business owner alleged that the city violated ordinance 267.1155 by failing to respond within 60 days. According to the business owner, the failure to respond meant that the application was granted by operation of law. The city sought an injunction, which was granted by the trial court. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the city's delayed decision on the business owner's application for a license did not violate the ordinance or invalidate the decision. The ordinance's language requiring that the decision be rendered within 60 days was discretionary, not mandatory. Moreover, the court noted that the business owner continued to operate its nude dancing business and did not suffer any monetary damages. Lastly, the court noted that the business owner's nude dancing enterprise was a nonconforming use. The 1992 amendment to the Minneapolis City Ordinance prohibited two or more regulated uses on the same block. Thus, the business owner could not expand.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the revocation. On further appeal, the court affirmed. Although the blood test was not drawn using only items taken from the approved BCA blood kit, there was ample evidence to support a finding by the district court that the test was valid. The technician who took the driver's blood testified that she always followed a specific procedure in drawing blood for legal blood alcohol testing and that by this procedure she used only the items found in the BCA kit.

Due to numerous complaints about the devise, the attorney general brought this action against the telemarketer and the companies for which he worked. The district court issued an injunction and rejected the telemarketer's constitutional challenge to Minn. Stat. &sect; 325E.26- .31 (1992). The appellate courts affirmed the injunction. The telemarketer then moved to amend his answer and counterclaim to add a new basis for constitutional attack in light of two recent United States Supreme Court decisions. The court denied the motion and, pursuant to the parties' agreement, entered final judgment and a permanent injunction against the telemarketer. On review, the court found that because there were no issues to be litigated, the district court properly determined that the Minnesota Supreme Court's decision in the case controlled. The court also found that Minn. R. Civ. P. 15, the trial court could deny a motion to amend if any substantial delay would result and if the amendment would accomplish nothing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deputy sheriff's car collided with an unlit tractor, killing the driver of the tractor.

He filed an action against the county, the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the county, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction. The deputy's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims were not barred by operation of Minnesota's procedural rule requiring plaintiffs challenging administrative decisions to proceed by petition for writ of certiorari because the 60-day filing requirement in Minn. Stat. &sect; 606.01 was insufficient to allow civil rights victims to recognize that they had a claim. The court held that the deputy was not deprived of a constitutional right because the county had the discretion to grant or refuse reimbursement under Minn. Stat. &sect; 465.76. Equal protection did not demand that the deputy receive reimbursement simply because other municipal employees were reimbursed under their municipalities' discretionary powers.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 147.091(6)(a) (1992).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to complaints about the doctor, a committee of the Board found probable cause to believe that the doctor could not practice medicine with the requisite skill to assure her patients' safety and it ordered the doctor to submit to a mental and physical examination. The doctor argued that the law requiring such examination was constitutionally defective. The court found that as a condition of licensure, the doctor gave her consent to a board-directed examination. In order to prevail on her request for an injunction, the doctor had to show she would suffer irreparable harm and that she was likely to succeed on the merits. The court found neither. The circumstances under which the examination was to take place did not cause an irreparable loss of privacy. The statute was constitutionally valid, because it was within the police power of the state to protect the health of its citizens. Because the Board's probable cause determination was subject to review both before and after any disciplinary action and because the physician was entitled to a hearing, the statute did not deny the doctor due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision denying an injunction to the doctor and permitting the Board to order her to submit to the required examination.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 152.024, subd. 2(2). The court affirmed the juvenile's adjudication as a delinquent. The search warrant was not unconstitutionally invalid. Key details of two informants' allegations were corroborated by each other. The interlocking tips from different informants enhanced the informants' credibility. Moreover, the police corroborated other details provided by the informants. Thus, the affidavit contained sufficient information, corroborated by the police and other information, to establish the informants' reliability. Nor was the officer's search of the juvenile unconstitutional. Where police had a valid search warrant to search one party and they reasonably mistook a second party for the first, the search of the second was valid. The officer believed only two males lived in the residence. The officer had met one and knew the person in the bedroom he entered was not him. The officer did not discover that the juvenile was not the suspect until after he conducted the search. The officer made a reasonable mistake in thinking that the juvenile was the suspect.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that his prosecution was barred by the prohibition of ex post facto laws of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1993, the State charged defendant with criminal sexual abuse of his son and stepson occurring between 1982 and 1986. At the time the criminal conduct occurred, the limitations period was seven years under Minn. Stat. &sect; 628.26(c) (1982). However, the limitations period was twice amended: first so that where the victim was under age 18 the limitations period expired two years after the offense was first reported to authorities, Minn.

The court rejected defendant's contention that the amendments deprived him of a defense which would have been available to him under the 1982 version of the statute of limitations, holding that a statute of limitations was a defense or protection from prosecution only after the limitations period had elapsed. Moreover, no ex post facto violation occurred because the change effected was merely procedural and did not increase the punishment, change the elements of the offense, or change the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. As to the sentencing issue, the court held that because incest was not assigned a severity level in the sentencing guidelines and defendant had been acquitted of the criminal sexual conduct charges, the judge could exercise his discretion by assigning an appropriate severity level. The court found that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by assigning a severity level of six to the felony incest conviction, and the sentence was within the presumptive range for level six crimes. The trial court supported its sentence with its statements that defendant had used very poor judgment in his relations with his niece and in his past relations as evidenced by similar crime evidence that had been admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first-degree and second-degree criminal sexual conduct. At the initial commitment hearing, three psychologists recommended that defendant be committed to the Minnesota Security Hospital as a psychopathic personality. The trial court committed defendant as a psychopathic personality to the hospital for an indeterminate period. The court affirmed the commitment. The court ruled that the trial court properly found that defendant showed a habitual course of sexual misconduct based upon his 40-year history of sexually abusing minor girls. The evidence supported a finding that defendant was a psychopathic personality as defined under Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 526.09 (1992). The court held that the trial court's decision was not an abuse of discretion. The evidence showed that defendant's behavior was impulsive and without volitional control, he refused treatment, he denied his misconduct, and it was likely that he would cause harm in the future.</SPAN></P>

The district court found that the method for recording town roads in Minn. Stat. &sect; 164.35, subd. 4 (1992) was unconstitutional since it was a taking without compensation.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that although the township had followed all of the procedural requirements of &sect; 164.35, subd. 4, pursuant to Minn. Const. art.

The inmate was not entitled to a new trial although no African-Americans were among the venire from which the jury was drawn, as under both U.S. Const. amend. VI and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, evidence that a distinctive group was not represented in a venire was, by itself, insufficient to establish a constitutional violation. Nor was the pretrial identification process and identification testimony unconstitutional and improperly admitted. The one-person show-up conducted soon after the crime did not create a substantial likelihood of misidentification. All four witnesses closely observed the inmate during the crime or soon thereafter, their descriptions of the him were substantially similar, and they identified the inmate with certainty. Although the jury heard a prejudicial, unsolicited statement from an interpreter during a witness' identification, the inmate's due process rights were not violated; the trial court took remedial measures and four other witnesses also identified the inmate.</SPAN></P>

The associate superintendent of the correctional facility where the inmate was housed, following yet another violent rape and robbery, petitioned for the inmate's commitment as a psychopathic personality. At the commitment hearing, the trial court heard testimony from some of the inmate's victims, three doctors, and others and found that the inmate had a psychopathic personality. The inmate argued that the evidence presented at trial failed to demonstrate that he had an utter lack of power to control his sexual impulses and that he was likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, loss, pain, or other evil on the objects of his uncontrolled and uncontrollable desires. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's findings. The inmate also challenged the trial court's decision to strike the testimony of an expert doctor. The court determined that the doctor's invocation of the Fifth Amendment precluded the State from meaningful cross-examination. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in striking the testimony.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the employee and his wife proved discrimination under &sect; 363.03(3)(a)(1) based on the entire sequence of events. The court held that (1) the representative perceived the wife's religious clothing as inappropriate and this, combined with the statement that she should dress as if going to church, indicated inferentially that religion played at least some role in the representative's decision to question the wife, (2) the representative's remark as to &quot;church&quot; was offensive to one of the Islamic faith, and (3) the wife's technical violation of the dress code, namely her footwear, was not called to her attention before she was escorted from the jetway.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 343.20-343.37 (1992 &amp; Supp. 1993). On the motion of respondent City of Minneapolis, the District Court of Hennepin County (Minnesota) dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. The organizations prosecuted an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court noted that a plaintiff had to possess, at a minimum, a bona fide legal interest that had been, or was about to be, affected in a prejudicial manner to obtain declaratory judgment relief. The trial court found that the organizations failed to show that they or any of their members were the subject of an enforcement action under the Cruelty to Animals Act, or that they were immediately threatened by such an action. The trial court dismissed the action for lack of concrete, legally cognizable interests directly threatened by the Cruelty to Animals Act. The court disagreed. Minn. Stat. &sect; 343.21, subd. 2 (1992) of the Cruelty to Animals Act provided that no person could deprive any animal over which the person had charge or control of necessary food, water, or shelter. The provision subjected the organizations and their members to an affirmative duty. The Declaratory Judgments Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 555.01-555.16 (1992) was remedial in nature and liberal construction applied to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity. The case was one where a declaratory judgment action was singularly appropriate for resolution of the dispute before commission of wrongs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the organizations' action and directed the trial court to reinstate the organizations' complaint.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 609.531, subd. 1a (1988) and concluded that &quot;contraband&quot; was intended by the legislature to include property that was illegal for a claimant to possess. Moreover, the court stated, it was not necessary that a claimant know the property was stolen in order for it to be subject to forfeiture. Therefore, the court concluded, because neither party had contested the trial court's finding that the property was stolen, it was illegal for the claimant to possess it, and the property was thus subject to forfeiture.

Testimony at trial showed that he was inappropriate with others in violating personal boundaries and had inappropriate sexual behavior towards women. The treatment team recommended commitment while the patient's brother protested, and one doctor favored short-term treatment. The trial court committed the patient as mentally ill. The patient appealed. The court held that a nursing home had refused to accept the patient until his behavior was under control, the patient was unable to care for his hygiene and clothing, and he became confused about his medication. Thus, the court held that the trial court decision was not clearly erroneous. The court held that Minn.

Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence and raised claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and erroneous evidentiary rulings. The court stated that the jury heard ample evidence from which it could infer that defendant knew or had reason to know that he possessed a stolen car. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to permit the jurors to reach they verdict which they did reach. The court further concluded that defendant had not met his heavy burden to establish that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in making decisions regarding the calling of witnesses. The trial court did not err when it ruled that defendant's prior petty misdemeanor and misdemeanor convictions were admissible. Defendant's petty misdemeanor conviction could not be used to impeach him under Minn. R. Evid. 609 because Minn. R. Crim. P. 23.06 directed that a petty misdemeanor would not be considered a crime. However, the petty misdemeanor conviction was admissible under Minn. R. Evid. 608(b) as a specific instance of conduct probative of defendant's truthfulness or untruthfulness.</SPAN></P>

The passenger contended that he was entitled to the full amount of the insurer's UIM coverage because he sustained, but did not recover the full amount of his damages from the driver's liability policy. On appeal, the court concluded that Minn. Stat. &sect; 65B.49(4a) applied where an injured passenger had not collected underinsured motorist benefits first from the car owner or driver's policy. Minn. Stat. &sect; 65B.49(3a)(5) should have been invoked against an injured person only when that person sought UIM benefits under his or her own policy after already qualifying for UIM benefits from another source. There was no &quot;excess&quot; coverage under subdivision 3a(5) because there was no coverage available to the passenger under the driver's policy that was &quot;like&quot; the coverage that he sought from the insurer. The trial court did not err in applying Minn. Stat. &sect; 65B.49(4a) to permit the passenger to receive the total amount available under the insurer's UIM coverage.

A petition for his commitment as a psychopathic personality was filed when defendant was scheduled for a release from prison. At the hearing, defendant testified that he had molested 17 children. A psychologist diagnosed defendant as an entrenched pedophile with a 15-year history of varying sexually inappropriate behavior toward young boys. A psychiatrist who was the clinical director of a sex offender program testified that defendant planned and plotted for opportunities to exploit children. The court reversed the district court's decision that committed defendant as a psychopathic personality. Absent a showing of violence, persons in the class of repetitive pedophiles were not to be committed as psychopathic personalities unless it was shown that they committed violent acts in the past and that they had such an utter lack of power to control their behavior that they were likely to do so in the future. Under the Minnesota Criminal Code, defendant's prior acts of sexual misconduct were not violent or assaultive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's niece filed a complaint alleging that he forced her to have intercourse with him twice. One incident occurred in Renville County and the other occurred in Goodhue County. He was charged with multiple counts in Goodhue County and, after a trial, he was found guilty. He was sentenced to terms of imprisonment on two of the counts that were to run consecutive with sentences imposed for the sexual assault of another niece. On appeal, the court affirmed his convictions on two counts. The trial court properly accepted venue for the Renville charges. The plain language of Minn. Stat. &sect; 627.15 (1990) and its legislative history revealed the intent to include a child's county of residence as a place the child may be &quot;found.&quot; Because defendant was in a position of authority as defined in Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.341, subd. 10 (1990), the child abuse that occurred fell under the provisions of Minn. Stat. &sect; 627.15 (1990). His failure to object to Spreigl evidence at trial constituted a waiver of the right to appeal that issue. Convictions on two of the counts had to be overturned because one count arose out of the same course of conduct and the other was a lesser-included offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purpose of the volunteer program was to enable the students to donate their time and services in Jamaica by working with teachers in two Catholic schools there, by conducting workshops for teachers, by mingling with students, and by handling student retreats.

The student teacher claimed that the college teachers' actions were abusive, demeaning, offensive, disrespectful and frightening. The student teacher argued that summary judgment was precluded by factual disputes concerning the expense of the trip, her claim of religious harassment, her claim of sexual harassment, as well as her other claims. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the summary judgment because the student teacher's claims were determined to be unfounded.</SPAN></P>

After the district denied the grievance, respondents first requested arbitration, but one month later brought their legal action. The trial court denied the district's motion for summary judgment, which was based on the argument that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to review the actions of a school board in teacher-related matters. The trial court then, sua sponte, issued an order and a memorandum interpreting &sect; 126.49 in respondents' favor and reserving the question of whether respondents' arbitration request was still pending, so as to enable review by certiorari. Respondents moved to compel arbitration and to stay court proceedings. The trial court ordered the parties to proceed with arbitration, but stayed arbitration pending appellate review. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, holding that the only proper procedure for reviewing the district's actions was though a petition for certiorari. Furthermore, certiorari review was no longer available to respondents because they had made an election of remedies. Their decision to litigate waived their right to arbitrate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the resident placed two signs in her front yard criticizing a decision of a local judge and relating to the treatment of animals, she received a letter from the city planner stating that the signs violated the city ordinance and directing her to remove them. The trial court ruled that the ordinance was not unconstitutional, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The purpose portion of the ordinance stated that it was based on concerns for public safety, order, cleanliness, aesthetics, and administrative convenience. Because these concerns were not related to content, the ordinance was content neutral. Because the ordinance allowed the posting of at least one opinion sign, which could contain multiple messages, on one or multiple issues, at any time of the year, it was reasonably and narrowly tailored. In addition to the signage and the multiple messages, there were alternative means to express opinions such as handbills, picketing, and letters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment finding the city ordinance restricting the placement of signs in a resident's property to be constitutional was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of violating Anoka, Minn., Code of Ordinances &sect; 20-4.5 (1992), a city's cruising ordinance. The conviction arose from a police stop after defendant was observed by a police officer to have driven through the city's cruising zone four times within approximately 10 minutes. Defendant challenged the legality and constitutionality of the city's cruising ordinance. On appeal, the court found that the city's zoning ordinance, which prohibited passing a floating traffic control point within a zone three or more times within a five hour period, with a range of exceptions too limited to allow for reasonable use of a city street, violated the fundamental right to travel and was unconstitutional on its face by reason of vagueness.

Relator appealed the grant of respondent's motion on the basis that the price did not fall below the minimum legal price with the rebate and consequently did not violate the intent of the law. The court affirmed the grant of respondent's motion because relator's interpretation of the law was incorrect since the prohibition against rebates and concessions was independent of the regulations regarding minimum legal price.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of assault, and the trial court imposed an upward durational departure from the presumptive sentence.

The court denied his motions. On appeal, the court held that defendant had not proved that counsel's representation was unreasonable or that trial errors prejudiced him. The court noted that the trial court did not treat defendant differently than similarly situated defendants. It held that the postconviction court correctly applied the law that was in effect when defendant moved for postconviction relief. Defendant was not entitled to public defender representation and, because the record showed that he was not entitled to postconviction relief, defendant was not entitled to a hearing. Defendant did not show any conflict of interest of counsel or resulting prejudice to him, and no error resulted because the postconviction judge was also the trial judge.</SPAN></P>

The trial court disagreed and entered judgment in the township's favor. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. In affirming, the court held that special assessments were presumed to be valid if the land received a special benefit from the improvement, the assessment was uniform upon the same class of property, and the assessment did not exceed the special benefit to the property. Because the assessment was uniform upon the same class of property and the assessment did not exceed the special benefit to the property, the assessment was valid. In addition, the court noted that the assessment formula was based on a standard of accessibility and was not arbitrary and capricious. The landowners failed to overcome the presumption of validity. The fact that all benefited properties were not assessed equally or that some benefited properties were not assessed did not invalidate the assessment.

Specifically, the court declined to hold that the ordinance was arbitrary and capricious because resubdividing platted lots had become a recurring issue for the town and because the town enacted the ordinance in order to permit the town and its residents to rely more confidently upon representations made in recorded plats. Furthermore, the court declined to find that the developer was entitled to relief under the reasonable reliance doctrine created by Minn.

At a bench trial, the trial court found that the value of the drugs was $ 1,600. The trial court adjudged defendant's house forfeited. Defendant appealed, but the court held that, because defendant had admitted selling drugs out of his house to friends, the evidence supported the trial court's finding that defendant sold cocaine from his house. Thus, the relationship between the real property and the offense was met. Further, the evidence supported the trial court's findings that the value of the drugs seized exceeded $ 1,000. Finally, the court held that the trial court properly considered the statutory factors, compared defendant's investment in the real property to the maximum fine for the applicable crimes, and found that the forfeiture was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought to vacate her convictions from the District Court, Hennepin County (Minnesota), for first degree tampering with a witness in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.498, subd. 1(c), and terroristic threats in violation of &sect; 609.713, subd. 1. Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support her convictions and that &sect; 609.498, subd. 1(c) was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant made two arguments that her convictions should be vacated: (1) that she did not intend to threaten or intimidate her victim and (2) that the statutes were unconstitutional. The court reviewed the evidence, including the victim's testimony, which defendant claimed conflicted with that of another witness, and the victim's fear of defendant as a result of defendant's alleged threats. The court held that, while there might have been a conflict between the witness testimony, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because either interpretation could lead a jury to believe that defendant had threatened the victim. The court also held that the reaction of the victim was circumstantial evidence of defendant's intent. The court then considered defendant's claim of unconstitutionality and held that defendant had the burden of showing that the statutes were unconstitutionally vague for failing to define a criminal offense. The court held that &sect; 609.498, subd. 1(c), specifically defined the crime and did not leave any doubt as to which persons fell within its scope. Defendant thus failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners bought a lot for the purpose of building a dock but not a residence. The adjoining lot had a house on it. A city ordinance required that in order to build a dock, there had to be a house on the property. The property owners built a new dock and after the city informed them that it was illegal, they applied for a variance. When the city denied their application, they proposed conveying some of their property to the adjoining lot owner and building a shared dock. The city denied their proposal. The district court determined that the denial of the property owners' application was arbitrary and capricious and ordered the city to approve their application for a shared dock. On appeal, the court reversed. The shared dock proposal was not acceptable under the zoning code because the use of the dock by the property owners would not have been incidental to the adjoining lot owner's use of his house. The denial of a variance was reasonable because the property owners were aware of the zoning code when they purchased the property. Their &quot;hardship&quot; was not a condition unique to their property. Further, the shared dock proposal was contrary to the aims of the zoning code.</SPAN></P>

Because he thought that defendant looked underage, he asked for identification. Defendant said he did not have identification and tried to leave.

Seeing a wallet-shaped object in defendant's pocket and believing that it was a wallet, the officer forcibly took the object and discovered that it was a plastic bag containing mushrooms. The trial court convicted defendant of possession of a controlled substance. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the search of defendant's pocket could not be justified as a search incident to a lawful arrest because defendant could not have been lawfully arrested when his pocket was searched, inasmuch as the officer had not seen him drink any alcohol. Even if the officer had authority to search defendant for identification, he should have first asked defendant to provide his name and age. The officer had no reason to pat-search defendant because he did not believe defendant was armed.

The trial court declared that Minn. Stat. &sect; 375.192 ratifying the county's policy on filing deadlines was constitutional and denied relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether, in the absence of any record that the legislature was aware of the details of the policies that it was ratifying, Minn. Stat. &sect; 375.192, subd. 2 (Supp. 1993) unconstitutionally delegated legislative authority to the counties to establish their own limitation periods for property tax abatement applications. The taxpayer conceded that the legislature had authority to ratify the county ordinances. It contended only that the legislature violated the constitutional limitations on delegating power by acting in the absence of a record showing that it knew the precise contents of the various ordinances. However, the court found that there was nothing in the case law to suggest that under the delegation doctrine the legislature had to ascertain the contents of a law before it could ratify it. All the constitution required was that the legislative standards created by the ratification were clear and ascertainable by those to whom the standards would apply. Here, the limitations periods applicable to abatement applications were unambiguous, regardless of whether the legislature actually knew the details of the policies of the individual counties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner of a vehicle drove to a motel. He entered one of the guest rooms without permission and stole a color television set valued at $ 300. He then used the car to deliver the TV to another person. The owner pled guilty to third-degree felony burglary charges. The city police department seized the vehicle, valued at between $ 2500 and $ 4500, initiated forfeiture proceedings, and moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding the trial court's application of the forfeiture statute did not violate the constitutional prohibition against excessive fines. Minnesota courts were never required to order forfeiture. A law enforcement agency that wished to deprive an owner permanently of property had to petition the court for an order of forfeiture. Once the court determined that property was subject to forfeiture, it had to decide whether to order forfeiture. Thus, Minnesota courts had discretion to order forfeiture of property used to commit a designated offense under the forfeiture statute. If the use of property played a significant part in committing an offense, then the property could be forfeited, no matter what its value.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.025, subd. 2(1) (1992). Defendant moved to suppress the evidence seized for lack of a search warrant. The trial court determined that the search and seizure was unconstitutional and dismissed the charges. The trial court noted that defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the open fields where the marijuana plants were being grown and that the officer was within his rights to view the plants both from above and from the ground. The court, however, concluded that the extended intrusion and continued trespass was unreasonable and unwarranted. The appeal followed. The court held that since the marijuana was seized in an open field, defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his activities there. Thus, he did not have standing to object to the search and seizure. Because defendant did not have standing to object to the search, the reasonableness of the search was not an issue. Accordingly, the trial court erred in dismissing the charges against defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature passed legislation which allowed county governments to maintain tax forfeited land and use the natural resources instead of collecting property taxes. Thereafter the state legislature repealed the legislation and the county government officials filed suit, claiming that the repeal impaired their contract obligations. The trial court dismissed the lawsuit for lack of standing and the officials appealed. The court held that under the general rule, a public official or governmental unit, in performing a ministerial duty under a statute, may not question the constitutionality of that statute. The court stated that to hold that a political subdivision employer was entitled to assail the constitutionality of legislative enactments every time the public was subject to the slightest economic burden would unjustifiably erode the doctrine of standing as it has been traditionally applied. The court determined that because the county officials were performing ministerial duties under the legislation, they lacked standing to challenge the repeal of the legislation.

Psychopathic personality was defined by Minn. Stat. &sect; 526.09 (1992). The court disagreed with the arguments of the patient that there was no evidence presented below that he had an utter lack of power to control his sexual impulses and that the trial court failed to apply the proper standard. In disagreeing, the court considered that he had committed multiple sexual assaults, which included force, beatings, and threats to kill and that he admitted that he was unable to control himself regarding heat of passion. The court ruled that the trial court's conclusion that the patient should be committed as a psychopathic personality was not clearly erroneous. The court stated that the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 526.09-526.20 (1992) had been upheld. In rejecting the argument that the evidence was insufficient because it was largely based on written documents, the court stated that the patient agreed to the admission of all documents taken as evidence.</SPAN></P>

The Board adopted an administrative law judge's (ALJ) findings of fact and conclusions, with minor clerical corrections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association operated a youth hockey program. The association was licensed to conduct lawful gambling. Agents of a department of public safety conducted an undercover investigation into allegations that illegal sports boards were being used at a certain bar. The association did not participate in the illegal gambling and was not aware of any unlawful gambling. The ALJ concluded that illegal gambling was conducted at the bar and that the Board was required to suspend the association's premises permit for the bar location for one year. The association brought a substantive due process challenge to Minn. R. 7861.0050 (Supp. II 1992). In affirming the decision, the court concluded that Minn. R. 7861.0050 (Supp. II 1992) was rationally related to maintaining the integrity of, and public confidence in, lawful gambling because it ensured that the public could enter an establishment where there was lawful gambling and be confident that no illegal gambling has been conducted on the premises. Minn. R. 7865.0050 (Supp. II 1992) did not contravene substantive due process on its face, nor was it invalid as applied to the association.</SPAN></P>

Several months later, he raped another 12-year-old girl and was imprisoned again. He was paroled and raped two more young women. The patient contended there was no evidence that he had an utter lack of power to control his sexual impulses. The trial court explicitly found that the patient met the statutory criteria in Minn. Stat. &sect; 526.09 (1992). It further found the patient's conduct showed an utter lack of power to control his sexual impulses, that his condition was only partially treated, and that he continued to be an imminent danger to others from sexual attack. Evidence showed that the patient committed habitual sex offenses, had no insight into his condition, did not believe he needed treatment, and continued to be hostile, angry, and dangerous. The trial court made proper findings, which were not clearly erroneous. The patient's arguments from civil commitment procedures were inapposite; the statutory definition of mentally ill and dangerous should not be used for determining whether an individual met the standards for commitment as a psychopathic personality.</SPAN></P>

On remand, the trial court against granted the owners' motion for summary judgment, and the neighbors appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court found that Minn. Stat. &sect; 500.20, subd. 2a (1988) set a 30 year duration for covenants but allowed a filing of a notice of claim, which delayed application of the 30 year provision. Because the neighbors had filed a notice of claim, the court held that the covenants were extended for an additional seven years under &sect; 500.20, subd. 2a. There were justiciable controversies throughout the litigation over whether &sect; 500.20, subd. 2a applied to the covenants and over whether the covenants were nominal. Section &sect;500.20, subd. 2a did not violate due process and was not unconstitutional. It did not violate the contracts clause of the United States and Minnesota Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court's failure to obtain a waiver of counsel on the record required a remand for a new trial. The court noted that defendant's right to counsel was the most important trial right he could have, and when defendant sought to appear pro se, the trial court was required to find that the request was clear, and that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel. Minn. R. Crim. P. 5.02 required that a waiver of counsel be in writing or on the record, or that the trial court appoint counsel to defendant. The trial court failed to accomplish any of those tasks.

The court further found that (1) the prima facie reference statute was not void for vagueness; (2) the statute did not shift the burden of proof to the juvenile; and (3) the statute did not violate equal protection because it created an age-based distinction rationally related to the objectives of the juvenile justice system.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, following a hearing, a trial court committed him as a psychopathic individual to a security hospital, a commitment that the court earlier affirmed on appeal.

Upon being committed for an indefinite period, the man appealed. Noting that the psychopathic personality law had been upheld against equal protection attack, the court, citing a supreme court ruling, rejected the man's substantive due process challenge to psychopathic personality commitments.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the District Court, Ramsey County (Minnesota), which convicted and sentenced him for criminal vehicular homicide. The trial court sentenced defendant to 87 months, a departure from the presumptive sentence of 58 months. The court also imposed a $ 4,000 fine and ordered $ 1,093 in restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A car knocked the victim to the ground in a crosswalk. After hesitating briefly, the driver sped away, running directly over the victim. The victim died immediately, or soon after. Two witnesses who knew defendant recognized him as the driver of the car. Defendant challenged: (1) a photographic lineup; (2) sufficiency of the evidence; (3) upward durational departure; and (4) imposing of the fine. The court affirmed in part, but vacated the fine. The court concluded that the lineup was not unconstitutionally suggestive and was not tainted by prior improper showup identification where the lineup occurred two days after the showup identification. The court further found sufficient evidence to support the conviction, noting that the in-court eyewitness identification of defendant was not based on a fleeting observation and so could support the conviction. The court further concluded that defendant's actions indicated a callous disregard for the law and dangerousness, which was sufficient to support the upward departure. However, the statute making a fine mandatory had not been in effect at the time the accident occurred, and so the fine had been improperly imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision except for the imposition of the fine, which was vacated.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the order of commitment, holding that there was ample evidence to support the trial court's decision. The court found that the patient was impulsive and lacked customary good judgment. His convictions were a direct result of his impulsiveness, anger, and attitude towards women. He shifted the blame and was resistant to addressing his sexual problems. He used force to get his way and often violated the rights of others to satisfy his urges, and he failed to appreciate the consequences of and had no remorse for his actions. The court also affirmed commitment to the Minnesota Security Hospital. The patient claimed that it was not the least restrictive alternative. The court found that it was the only facility offering the intense long-term treatment required for psychopathic personalities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, former operators of a two-year college, challenged the grant by the District Court, Hennepin County (Minnesota), of summary judgment in favor of respondent city and against their claims of unconstitutional taking of property and tortious interference with prospective business advantage. They also argued that the chief judge of the district erred in denying their motion to remove the judge who granted summary judgment in the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operators argued that the city's imposition of a one-year development moratorium forced their property into foreclosure, amounting to an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation. The court disagreed and found no evidence of a taking by the city either under the &quot;categorical takings&quot; or the &quot;Penn Central balancing&quot; tests. There was no evidence that the moratorium prevented the sale of the property to prospective buyers. The court noted that even if all economically beneficial use was denied during the moratorium, economic use existed at the end of the moratorium period. There was no evidence that a judge ordered foreclosure because of the moratorium. The operators presented no evidence to support their assertion that the moratorium affected their ability to sell the property before the foreclosure. There were no genuine issues of material fact as to whether the city tortiously interfered with three prospective business relationships. The chief judge of the district did not err in failing to remove the judge hearing the summary judgment motion; inter alia, a removal motion could not rest on a family relationship that no longer existed.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the complaint was amended to include additional charges of a second degree controlled substance crime and aiding and abetting. The State dropped the aiding and abetting charge, and defendant was convicted of the other two charges. The court affirmed the convictions. The trial court did not err in refusing to dismiss the entire jury panel based on defendant's entry into the jury panel room before voir dire because no juror bias was shown. Even though the officers', without a warrant, may have entered the hallway of the apartment building in which the drug transaction took place in order to ascertain the correct apartment number, the application for a search warrant was sufficient even without the apartment number. The warrantless search of defendant's backpack was lawful because no warrant was required for a search incident to a lawful arrest in a motor vehicle. The elements of proving possession did not change when the aiding and abetting charge was added to the complaint or when it was dropped. Thus, defendant was not prejudiced by the amendments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee personal representative served a garnishment notice on the debtor's bank in an attempt to satisfy a judgment against the debtor for fraudulent misrepresentation. The debtor claimed that his bank assets were exempt under Minn. Stat. &sect; 550.37(24) (1990). The trial court disallowed the exemption. On appeal, the court reversed and allowed the exemption, but the Minnesota Supreme Court remanded the case for a determination of the constitutionality of &sect; 550.37(24). The trial court held that the rollover account was not exempt because &sect; 550.37(24) violated the constitution. The court held that the representative had not demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute violated the &quot;reasonable amount&quot; requirement in Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The court held that Minn. Const. art. XII, &sect; was not violated by &sect; 550.37(24)(1) because different treatment of nonexempt retirement funds from qualified tax-exempt retirement funds did not make clause (1) unconstitutional special legislation. The court found that the Internal Revenue Code provisions cited in &sect; 550.37(24)(1) provided objective limitation criteria that prevented unlimited contributions to qualified retirement accounts.</SPAN></P>

The arbitrator ordered the insurer to pay medical and wage loss benefits, but the trial court vacated the award, concluding that the insured's unreasonable failure to attend the examination automatically allowed the insurer to terminate payment of further no-fault benefits. In reversing, the court held that mere noncooperation, without more, did not mandate automatic termination. Although an insured who failed to cooperate with a properly scheduled examination had to be prepared to accept negative consequences, noncooperation did not automatically zero out all insureds in all claims. The court further held that the requirement of mandatory arbitration pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 65B.525, subd. 1, did not violate the Minnesota Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Upon receipt of the patient's 60-day treatment report, following his initial commitment, the district court conducted a two-day commitment hearing. Testimony was presented about the patient's conduct and his criminal acts, psychologists testified as to the patient's condition, and the patient's medical records and psychological evaluations were admitted. The court held that the district court did not clearly err in concluding that the patient was a psychopathic personality. The record demonstrated that the patient had three convictions in three years for crimes involving exposing himself to or abusing young boys, he was diagnosed as a pedophile and as having a psychopathic personality, the patient refused to participate in assessment or treatment, he had a high probability of reoffending, and he sought out activities that placed him in contact with young children. The court rejected the patient's constitutional challenges to the psychopathic personality statute. Nothing in the record indicated that the county attorney agreed to waive the opportunity to start civil commitment proceedings against the patient.</SPAN></P>

The cases were heard by the District Courts of Hawker, Schmelzer, Lettow, Berg, Willetts, Iverson, Dopp, and Decker Counties (Minnesota), which made findings as to whether the law violated due process and addressed statutory challenges to the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The drivers challenged on statutory, fundamental fairness, and procedural due process grounds the Commissioner's decision to revoke their drivers' licenses pursuant to the implied consent law. It was held that one driver's right to counsel was not vindicated. Other district courts vindicated the drivers' constitutional and statutory challenges to the implied consent law. One district court determined that there was probable cause as to one driver's revocation. Upon consolidated review, the court affirmed as to the right to counsel issue, concluding that the driver was not given enough time to contact an attorney. The court also affirmed the finding that probable cause was established by a preponderance of the evidence. However, the court reversed on the constitutional and statutory grounds, holding (1) that under the applicable balancing test, the implied consent law did not violate procedural due process, (2) that the failure to advise the drivers of all of the potential consequences of not submitting to an intoxication test was not fundamentally unfair, and (3) that refusing to take the test did not provide them with a &quot;safe harbor&quot; because they had a limited right to counsel.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the orders which rescinded the revocations on statutory, fundamental fairness, and procedural due process grounds.</SPAN></P>

The trial court thereafter issued a two-year restraining order, which provided that he could not come within two blocks of her home. On review, the court found no error. The court held that &sect; 609.748 was not an unconstitutional infringement of the picketer's First Amendment, U. S. Const. amend. I, rights of free speech and free exercise of religion. Because the order prohibited him from communicating with the director, and not from communicating his political or religious beliefs, the court held that it was content neutral.

The newspaper challenged the order by filing a petition for a writ of prohibition, which was denied. The court rejected the newspapers' claim that the trial judge had imposed an impermissible prior restraint on the publication of information. The court noted that the trial judge did not restrain the newspapers from publishing information already in their possession about the juveniles or their prior involvement with the juvenile court system, or information they might later obtain from other sources. The court found that the trial judge properly focused on &quot;the incremental injury&quot; to the juveniles that would be caused by testifying in public, as distinguished from the effect of confronting the criminal defendant and the trauma inherent in testifying about personal matters.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the members alleged that they did not violate the Open Meeting Law and that their equal protection rights were violated when the citizens settled with two council members who were former defendants in the underlying action. The citizens asserted that the members should have been removed from office pursuant to &sect; 471.705, subd. 2. The court held that the trial court's conclusion that the gatherings were subject to the Open Meeting Law was not clearly erroneous because the gatherings were meetings and closed to the public. The court further held that the members' equal protection rights were not violated because the citizens' actions did not involve state action. Moreover, the council members failed to prove that the citizens intentionally discriminated against them.

A clinical psychologist testified that the patient suffered from a psychopathic personality.

Another psychologist testified that the patient would reoffend by exposing himself in the future.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating Town of White Bear, Minn., Ordinance No. 63 (1990), a township ordinance that prohibited targeted residential picketing. Defendant had been arrested for violating the targeted residential picketing ordinance after he refused to stop picketing in front of the residence of the executive director of Planned Parenthood of Minnesota. On appeal, defendant facially challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance on the grounds of overbreadth and vagueness. The trial court's judgment was affirmed upon a finding that the ordinance was facially constitutional. The court found that the ordinance was content neutral because it unequivocally prohibited all targeted residential picketing regardless of the content of the speech. The court also found that the ordinance fully met the requirement that a valid government interest be served by the regulation of expression because it specifically stated that that the town had an interest in protecting residential privacy. Finally, the court found that the ordinance was narrowly tailored to protect unwilling occupants of a single-family residential dwelling.</SPAN></P>

The recipient poured more gas on the fire, the gas can exploded, and she was seriously burned. Through its medical assistance program, the Department disbursed money for the recipient's medical treatment. The recipient negotiated a settlement from her father's and brother's insurer. The Department filed suit to satisfy its lien out of the settlement proceeds. The district court ruled that a settlement agreement did not preclude the Department from recovering on a medical assistance lien. The court affirmed holding that the Department's failure to participate in negotiations did not preclude it from satisfying its lien out of the resulting settlement, subject to the recipient's minimum one-third take.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the sex offender was awaiting discharge from imprisonment after serving his sentence, the State petitioned to have him committed as a psychopathic personality. Following a hearing, the trial court ordered the commitment of the sex offender under Minn. Stat. &sect; 526.09 (1992). The sex offender appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that the trial court's findings of fact were not clearly erroneous. In addition to the five rapes for which he had been convicted, he admitted committing approximately 35 additional rapes. The circumstances surrounding his convictions demonstrated hostile, uncontrolled, and repetitive actions. The evidence of the sex offender's continuing ability to control his sexual impulses or even to recognize precursors was clear and convincing, and the evidence was sufficient to establish that he was likely to commit similar crimes in the future. The fact that he had not recently committed such a crime was not dispositive because the artificial prison environment did not present the sex offender with an opportunity to commit additional patterned offenses, and the sex offender had been imprisoned for all but three years from age 19 to 54.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the city ordinance was not a valid time, place, and manner restriction on public nudity because it was not content-neutral. The ordinance prohibited only some forms of nudity. The interest in prohibiting nude dancing was directly related to the suppression of free expression. Because the ordinance was enacted to suppress protected expression, it was not a valid exercise of the city's inherent police power. The court also found that the expression was protected under Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to an assignment by the MPUC, the area received electrical service from the association. The city filed several petitions to condemn, by quick-take, the associations electrical service rights in the area in order to extend its own utility service to the annexed area. On a prior appeal, the state supreme court determined that a city could extend its provision of utility service to annexed territory either by purchase under terms determined by the MPUC pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 216B.44-46, or by eminent domain proceedings under the jurisdiction of the courts, pursuant to &sect; 216B.47. On remand, the district court authorized the city to condemn the area by quick take. On appeal, the court agreed with the district court's determination that appellants' challenge to the annexation was an impermissible collateral attack. After the city annexed the area, the area became urban; therefore, any subsequent condemnation of the utility property in the area did not interfere with the purpose of the Rural Electrification Act, 7 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 901-940.

Accordingly, under the decisions of the United States Supreme Court, the court held that the sobriety checkpoint was invalid under the federal Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the District Court, Wright County (Minnesota) of committing a controlled substance crime in the fourth degree, Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.024, subd. 2(2) (1992). On appeal, the main issue was whether a deputy's affidavit in support of an application for a warrant was invalid because it was not supported by facts establishing probable cause to believe contraband would be found in defendant's home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the affidavit, the deputy described incidents in which defendant was involved with small amounts of drugs or other drug-related items and large amounts of cash. Three incidents involved arrests for possession of a controlled substance. The deputy stated that, based on that information and his described extensive experience, he believed that defendant's home would contain controlled substances. A search warrant issued. On appeal, the court agreed that it was significant that there was no evidence that defendant did not have a large quantity of drugs associated with major sales activity, but that consideration dimmed in light of evidence of his possession of large amounts of cash, a weapon, drug paraphernalia, and incriminating notes. In the circumstances, there was an increased likelihood that police would find drugs and drug paraphernalia at his home. The affidavit was not false or misleading. By reciting only the arrests, the affidavit created no implications as to whether or not defendant was prosecuted or convicted. Nor was the information stale. By failing to raise a constitutional claim in the trial court, defendant failed to preserve the issue for appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 617.80-617.87 (1992) that permitted respondent city to enjoin appellants from operation of &quot;adult&quot; businesses at the location based upon proof that appellants had failed to halt prostitution on the premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two prostitution convictions were based upon acts on the premises. The city sought to enjoin appellants from operating further adult businesses at the location under Minn. Stat. &sect; 617.82 (1992). The district court found that the location was a public nuisance, closed the building for a year, and permanently enjoined the operation of an adult business there. Appellants sought review. Although appellants had possession of the building on alternate days, there was really only one entity. Because only one of the two offending owners were evicted, appellants' response was inadequate. The federal court's finding that &sect;&sect; 617.80-617.87 was constitutional was binding. Appellants had notice and opportunity to be heard, which was all that due process required. Appellants were not prosecuted for crimes but for failure to prevent crimes on the premises. Appellants were free to associate with prostitutes but not to tolerate repeated criminal activity on their premises. Because the taking was temporary, was limited to &quot;adult&quot; businesses, and did no cause appellants to lose all economically beneficial use of the property, appellants were not entitled to compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the district court, which adjudicated the location a public nuisance, closed the location for one year, and enjoined appellants from operating adult businesses at the location.</SPAN></P>

Defendants claimed on appeal that the restraining order was unconstitutional, that their convictions violated the ex post facto clause, Minn. Const. art.

The court rejected defendants' claims. The court ruled that defendants could not indirectly attack the validity of the restraining order because they did not appeal the order within 30 days after it was issued, that the ex post facto laws did not apply because defendants were convicted for conduct that occurred after the harassment statute was adopted, and that defendants' convictions were supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

Appellants sought review of the order on the basis of qualified, discretionary function as well as due care in the execution of a statute immunity. The action was filed by respondents, a waste recovery cooperative and a waste hauler, who sought a restraining order and damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Minn. Stat. &sect; 115A.553 (1990) required that the county ensure that materials separated for recycling were taken to markets for sale or to recycling processing centers. Two county investigators went to inspect the cooperative's facility, and they observed shredded telephone directories. Burning the directories did not fall within the definition of recycling. The court first found that appellants were immune from suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 under the doctrine of qualified immunity. The act of sending letter directives did not violate any Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to just compensation for property taken by the government. Furthermore, there was no taking because appellants did not take possession of the directories or instigate a process to revoke any licenses so as to invoke the requirement of due process. However, the investigators acted belligerently once on the land and after a police officer arrived. Therefore, because a material fact dispute existed, the court could not conclude that the investigators were acting with due care in executing their duties. As such, immunity was properly denied under Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.03, subd. 5 for common law trespass.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the denial of appellants' motion for summary judgment on the issue of qualified and discretionary function immunity. The court affirmed the denial of appellants' motion for summary judgment on the issue of due care immunity. The court then remanded the action for a trial on the trespass issue. The court declined interlocutory review of the remaining issues.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 253B.08, subd. 1 (1992), even though it was held more than 44 days after the commitment was initiated because defendant waived the 44-day requirement. The court also determined that the State did not improperly provide its experts with defendant's confidential corrections records because under Minn. Stat. &sect; 13.05, subd. 6, the State's expert was authorized to obtain the records to evaluate defendant's medical condition. In addition, the court stated that the evidence supported defendant's commitment as a psychopathic personality because defendant had an utter lack of power to control his sexual impulses and therefore the trial court's ruling was not clearly erroneous. Finally, the court concluded that the application of the psychopathic personality statute did not deny him due process or equal protection, nor was it unconstitutional. The court upheld defendant's commitment and denied the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city denied the lumber company's request for a conditional use permit. The lumber company appealed, contending that the decision amounted to a taking of its property without just compensation, but the trial court granted summary judgment to the city. The trial court held that the lumber company was not denied all reasonable economic use of its property. On review of the decision, the court noted that the trial court was correct in its determination that the lumber company continued to enjoy a reasonable and economically viable use of its property after its request for the permit was denied. The court also noted that the lumber company was a successor in interest to the same claim made by its predecessor, and that the doctrine of res judicata barred the claim because a final judgment on the merits had been awarded in the previous action. Finding no justification to reverse the decision, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

On a motion for summary judgment, the trial court granted judgment in favor of the town and held that the ordinance was a valid exercise of police power and did not violate the law. On appeal, the owners argued that the ordinance exceeded the town's statutory authority to regulate the keeping of animals and that it arbitrarily discriminated against the private ownership of wild animals. The court held that the town's police power allowed it to regulate the keeping of wild animals and also to define nuisances and provide for their abatement. It was found that the tiger and leopard were inherently dangerous animals and presented a potential risk to the public. Therefore, the court concluded that the town was within its police authority in regulating the keeping of wild animals. Further, it was reasoned that the ordinance did not conflict with the federal Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1535(f) (1988) because it did not threaten endangered species but simply regulated their keeping within town limits.</SPAN></P>

At the motion hearing, the clinic called one of the contemnors as a witness. His attorney immediately asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege, noting that he was charged with criminal contempt for violating the TRO. The trial court found him in direct criminal contempt for his refusal to answer, and sentenced to 10 days in jail and similarly with the other contemnor. The trial court later explained that its intent was to find the contemnors in contempt only for refusing to answer questions not related to any constructive criminal contempt charges. On review, the court reversed. The court held that the contemnors properly invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege in response to questions asked them in the civil contempt proceeding.

The Home Rule Amendment, Minn. Const. art. XII, &sect; 3, authorized the legislature to set up eligibility requirements for county offices. The candidates cited the legislative history of in an attempt to show that legislature had no intention to alter eligibility requirements. The court held that the use of legislative history was of questionable value where the plain language of Minn. Const. art. XII, &sect; 3 appeared to clearly authorize the legislature to change qualifications for office.

The news media had no constitutional right of access to the information in the investigative file. The trial court properly ordered expungement of information in the file to protect the hockey player from harm that would be caused by the release of the information because the benefits to him of moving forward with a productive life outweighed the disadvantage to the public's need to know.

The court declined to consider the issue and affirmed defendant's conviction because show-up identification procedures were valid when conducted without counsel. Thus, defendant could show no prejudice. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress in-court identifications of him because the pre-trial identification procedures created a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. The court rejected defendant's argument, finding that under the facts, there was no substantial likelihood of misidentification. Moreover, witnesses had more than adequate independent origin on which to base their in-court identification. Defendant further argued that the evidence did not justify either the convictions or the length and type of sentence. The court determined that defendant's sentence was within sentencing guidelines and did not unfairly exaggerate the criminality of his conduct.

Defendant asserted that the statute under which his sentence was enhanced, Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.152, subd. 2, (1990), was unconstitutionally vague and unconstitutional as applied to him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who took a purse from an elderly woman in a parking lot, was convicted of robbery. The district court, applying &sect; 609.152, subd. 2, imposed an enhanced sentence of 108 months. His presumptive sentence was 54 months. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding, first, that &sect; 609.152, subd. 2 was not unconstitutionally vague. The &quot;danger to public safety&quot; criteria for sentence enhancement was included in other criminal statutes with which criminal courts had experience. The &quot;high frequency rate of criminal activity,&quot; and &quot;long involvement in criminal activity&quot; factors did not improperly limit application to offenders with relatively minor or nondangerous offenses. The court noted that the statute was not unreasonable and arbitrary merely because a judge could have reached different results when applying it. The court also held that &sect; 609.152, subd. 2 was not unconstitutionally applied to support the double upward durational sentence departure. The district court properly found that defendant was a danger to public safety, pursuant to &sect; 609.152, subd. 2(2)(i), (ii), based upon his high frequency and long involvement in criminal activity, as well as the victim's advanced age.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court, Crow Wing County (Minnesota), denied a motion for summary judgment filed by appellants, a city and a police officer, and respondent county, in respondent trustee's action for negligence, violation of a deceased's civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and negligence in training and supervision. Appellants challenged the denial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustee's husband was shot by a police officer. The city and the county argued, inter alia, that the officer's actions were protected by governmental immunity. The court held that the trustee properly stated a &sect; 1983 claim against the officer because the trustee alleged that the officer deprived the decedent of a federal right and that he acted under color of law. The court held that respondent county was entitled to summary judgment on the trustee's &sect; 1983 claims because the trustee did not present evidence of an unconstitutional custom, practice, or policy. The summary judgment motion based on qualified immunity to the &sect; 1983 claim was properly denied. The officer violated the decedent's clearly established rights and no reasonable officer would have acted similarly when the officer was not sufficiently threatened so as to justify the use of deadly force. The officer was not entitled to official immunity from the trustee's common law tort claims. The facts that the officer intentionally shot the decedent and that the officer was aware of city policy regarding the use of deadly force were sufficient to let the jury decide whether his actions constituted a malicious wrong.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of the police officer's motion for summary judgment and the city and county's summary judgment motion on the issue of qualified immunity and reversed the denial of the county's motion for summary judgment on the &sect; 1983 claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The notice was dismissed because it was filed after the 20-day statutory deadline and relator presented no valid reason to vacate the order. Relator petitioned the OSHRB for reconsideration on the basis that unforeseen circumstances surrounding a hazardous chemical spill prevented a timely filing of a notice of contest and constituted good cause to set aside the Commissioner's dismissal. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that relator had 15 days prior to the spill, and one day after clean-up efforts concluded, to file a timely notice of contest. Under those facts, the court found the OSHRB's affirmance of the dismissal to be justifiable and supported by substantial evidence as a matter of law. Further, the court held that the OSHRB relied on permissible and discernible factors in rendering its decision. According to the court, that was sufficient to survive judicial scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in admitting Spreigl evidence that defendant had been convicted of second degree criminal sexual conduct 13 years earlier. The court held that the evidence was clear and convincing that the defendant participated in the Spreigl incident, the evidence was relevant because defendant's conduct was virtually identical to the charged crimes, and the probative value of the Spreigl evidence outweighed its potential for unfair prejudice. While the victim was able to identify defendant as her attacker, it was within the trial court's discretion to find that the State needed the Spreigl evidence to meet its burden of proof. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress results of a photo line-up, and in sentencing him pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.346 (1990). The court found that although not every person in the photo display matched the victim's description of her attacker, they bore a reasonable physical similarity to defendant. The display was not impermissibly suggestive. Lastly, the court correctly sentenced defendant to the mandatory minimum sentence because of his prior conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case arose after a female client of the counselor reported that the counselor had manually touched her breasts during several hugs after counseling sessions. The counselor was found guilty of six counts of fourth degree criminal sexual conduct. He did not appeal his conviction. However, the counselor filed a postconviction petition alleging that his trial counsel was ineffective. The petition alleged that counsel should have moved to dismiss the complaint on grounds that the statute was vague, should have pursued a juror misconduct issue further, and should have requested a particular jury instruction. The trial court denied the motion. On review, the court noted that, as to many of the charges, there was no record to review because the counselor failed to seek a postconviction hearing to make such a record. With reference to a charge that his counsel should have sought a hearing on the issue of juror misconduct, the court found that there was a mid-trial hearing at which the affected juror was questioned by the court. While the issue could have been handled differently, the counselor did not show that the outcome would have been different.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An air ambulance service applied for a license to provide specialized ground ambulance service. An administrative law judge recommended that the license be granted, but the state commissioner of health denied the license on the ground that the ambulance service had not established a need for service beyond that already provided by a competitor, a factor to be considered under Minn.

On review, the court found that the ambulance service did not establish, by the required preponderance of the evidence, that its service was needed. The court noted that discovery was available to the ambulance service to obtain this evidence, but the ambulance service made no attempt to discover the necessary information. The court also rejected the ambulance service's argument that state licensing procedures were preempted by the Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1305(a)(1).

The trial court found that even though not all of the document had nonpublic components, access was to be denied because all the documents were classified as unseverable bundles of nonpublic data. The court held that the trial court used the wrong standard to analyze the documents. The court found, inter alia, that (1) the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act established a presumption that government data were public and were accessible by the public for both inspection and copying, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 13.01, subd. 3 (1992), with some exceptions; (2) one exception was a provision that classified &quot;security information&quot; as nonpublic; and (3) an entire document could be withheld only when the public and nonpublic information were so inextricably intertwined that segregating the material would impose a significant financial burden and leave the remaining parts of the document with little informational value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant along with the victims was selling drugs from defendant's mother's home. After the neighbors' complained, the mother asked them to move out. Defendant argued that while attempting to have them move out, they returned to his mother's home and he had to kill the three men in self-defense. The trial court disagreed and convicted defendant of their murders. On appeal, the court affirmed that conviction. Defendant argued that even if his belief that he was in danger of imminent bodily harm was unreasonable, he should nevertheless have been acquitted if his belief was honestly held. He thus argued a mistake of fact, rather than a mistake of law. The court held that the law upon which defendant relied was premised both upon the complexity of the tax laws and Congress' intent to make specific intent an element of tax crimes, therefore it was not controlling. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the bifurcation of insanity trials was constitutionally suspect because that procedure prohibited him from explaining in a single trial why he believed that he was in danger. The court again held that the law defendant relied upon was inapplicable and that bifurcation was sound.</SPAN></P>

The administrative law judge affirmed the Board's denial, and the companies sought judicial review. On appeal, the court found that most of the original applications were rejected on the basis that the companies had insurance coverage that would provide reimbursement for some of the costs. The court also found that after delays by the Board, an amendment to the Minnesota Petroleum Release Cleanup Act became effective, specifically disallowing reimbursement for insured costs. The court ruled that the Board did not err in denying the companies' requests for reimbursement of costs that were incurred in cleaning up the petroleum leaks. The court held that the Board did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in tabling some applications. The court held that the companies had no right to reimbursement until the Board had finally acted on their applications. The companies had no vested right that was constitutionally protected because the Board had not finally acted on their applications when the amendment went into effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the manager of a property, challenged a judgment of the District Court, Hennepin County (Minnesota), that granted respondent county's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the manager's appeal from a forfeiture of the property for nonpayment of real estate taxes. The district court ruled that the manager failed to comply with the deposit requirement of Minn. Stat. &sect; 284.10 (1990) and that the deposit requirement was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Real estate taxes were unpaid for three years while the manager was employed by the property's previous owner, and they remained unpaid for three more years after a corporation in which the manager was the sole shareholder bought the property. When the manager appealed from the tax forfeiture, he deposited part, but not all, of the accumulated unpaid taxes. On appeal from the dismissal, he alleged that the deposit requirement was unconstitutional and that he should have been personally served with notice of the expiration of the redemption period. The court affirmed the district court judgment. The manager was required to deposit the full amount of delinquent taxes, and as the property's manager he had access to documents from which that amount could have been determined. The deposit requirement of &sect; 284.10 did not unconstitutionally deprive the manager of access to the courts because he knew of the tax liability when he bought the property and the statutory process offered pre-forfeiture protections. Minn. Stat. &sect; 281.13 (1990) was inapplicable, and Minn. Stat. &sect; 281.23 (1990) did not require personal service on the manager as an occupant of the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company's founder and president suffered from a chronic mental disability. Because of the founder's disability, the company was certified as a targeted group business for purposes of participation in the state's small business procurement program under Minn. Stat. 16B.19, subds. 2a, 2b (1990). After the company's certification, the legislature amended the act and redefined targeted groups, eliminating persons suffering from mental disabilities. As a result of the amendment, the company was no longer qualified for the program. The court affirmed the Commissioner's decision upholding the revocation. The court held that &sect; 16B.19 subd. 2b did not deny the founder equal protection under the federal and state constitutions. The mentally disabled were not a suspect class, therefore the state only had to demonstrate a rational basis for differentiating between physical and mental disabilities. The state asserted that there was no evidence before the legislature of past discrimination against businesses that were owned and operated by the mentally disabled. The legislature was not required to address all evils at once when it adopted the remedial legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three prostitution convictions were obtained for transactions occurring in each of the property owners' establishments.

In affirming the dismissal of the actions for failure of notice, the court held that &sect; 617.81, subd. 3, required that a separate notice of conviction had to be sent after each conviction to the building owner and other interested parties. The court noted that &sect; 617.81, subd. 3, required &quot;notice of a conviction,&quot; and that the word &quot;a&quot; denoted a single conviction. The court also concluded that it would be unfair and counter to the purpose of the public nuisance statute if the City was not required to advise the property owner of the first and second convictions to enable the owner to take measures to abate the nuisance before it was faced with closure of the establishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured and his wife were injured in a car collision when another vehicle crossed the median and struck their car. The insured settled with the other driver's insurer and collected a settlement amount. The insured provided notice to the insurer. The insured sought underinsured motorist coverage benefits from the insurer because of the limited coverage of the driver. An arbitrator was appointed and the arbitrator awarded the insured damages and pre-award interest. The trial court confirmed the award but refused to award interest. The court held that the amendments to Minn. Stat. &sect; 549.09(1)(b) could apply retroactively in cases involving insurance and the trial court erred in holding that the statute did not have any retroactive effect. The court concluded that prejudgment interest was inappropriate because the interest in addition to the arbitration award exceeded the maximum liability limit of the insured's policy. The court noted that the insured did not contract for prejudgment interest exceeding the liability of his policy and to require the insurer to pay the interest would have been rewriting the parties' contract.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he alleged that: (1) his blood test results should have been suppressed; (2) Minn.

In affirming the decision, the court found that the trial court properly departed upward based upon defendant's attempt to flee and because the fatality occurred in front of children. The validity of defendant's previous conviction was properly proven. The blood test results were properly admitted because defendant had no right to refuse testing. The officer had probable cause to believe that defendant was intoxicated and had committed criminal vehicular operation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State sought review of a judgment of the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota), which awarded respondent property owner an interest rate that was greater than that set by Minn. Stat. &sect; 549.09, subd. 1(c), for the value of land that the State acquired through eminent domain proceedings. A panel of three court-appointed commissioners determined the amount of damages that the State owed to the property owner for the acquisition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court heard oral arguments in chambers from attorneys for each side and received a transcript of the deposition of witnesses. The court held that the summary proceeding did not violate the due process rights of the State because summary proceedings were authorized by statute. The court found that the landowner was entitled to that return on the money equivalent of the property which would have been available if the landowner had been timely paid and had made reasonable and prudent investments. The return that would satisfy the requirements of just compensation could be more, less, or equal to the return allowed by statute. The court found that since it could not say that the district court clearly erred, the order awarding interest was not erroneous. Further, the trial court's determination of the interest issue on the authorities, affidavits, documents, deposition, and oral arguments of counsel submitted upon the motion for interest, without the taking of oral testimony, was not an abuse of discretion and did not deny due process of law. The evidence supported the district court's award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims were injured, one of them very seriously, in an accident caused by defendant driver. The driver had entered the club alone and had drunk alone in the club earlier in the day. He was not a member of the club. The club's license, under Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 340A.404, subd. 1(4), permitted it to sell liquor only to members and bona fide guests. The court held that the trial court properly directed a verdict against the club on the issue of an illegal sale because the driver was neither a member nor a bona fide guest of the club. The court held that the term &quot;bona fide guest&quot; in the statute was not vague. Although not defined in the statute, it had a generally recognized meaning. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing improper argument to the jury because the club failed to object. The trial court properly applied the collateral source rule to deduct from the award amounts paid by the victims' health insurer because the health insurer had no right of subrogation against the club under the dram shop act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">School district brought an action against appellant after it discovered that manufacturer's fireproofing product contained asbestos and had to be removed. The district began removal and sued manufacturer for the costs. A jury found in favor of district on all counts and awarded compensatory as well as punitive damages. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the tort remedies of negligence and strict liability were available to the district as it was not a merchant of fireproofing material and because its cause of action was not a claim for economic loss. The 15-year statute of limitations applied to the district's action where the legislature did not manifest a clear intent to apply a 10-year statute of limitations retroactively. Manufacturer failed to produce any evidence to establish a genuine issue of fact as to product identification and, a requested comparative fault instruction was properly withheld absent any evidence supporting submission of the comparative fault issue to the jury. While punitive damages were properly awarded, pursuant to the factors set forth in Minn. Stat. &sect; 549.20(3) the court reduced the award by one-half.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pled not guilty to a charge of misdemeanor speeding and demanded a jury trial, over his objection the District Court, Renville County (Minnesota) allowed the State to reduce the charge to a petty misdemeanor and defendant was found guilty in a trial by the court. On appeal, one issue was whether the State had to obtain defendant's consent before reducing the charge from a misdemeanor to a petty misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In granting the State's motion, the trial court found that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.131, subd. 1 (1990) governed conflicting provisions in Minn. R. Crim. P. 23.04. Thus, defendant's consent to the reduction in charges was not required. On appeal, the court noted that its review was governed by principles of comity in that due respect for the coequal branches of government required the court to exercise great restraint before striking down a statute as unconstitutional, particularly when it involved a determination of what was a legislative and what was a judicial function. The court held that Rule 23.04 directly conflicted with Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.131, subd. 1 (1990) as to whether defendant's consent was required. But, the court reaffirmed an earlier decision and held that &sect; 609.131, subd. 1 governed. That, in the interim between its earlier decision and the case at bar, the advisory committee for the rules of criminal procedure had added certain language to its comment to Minn. R. Crim. P. 23.04 made no difference. Such comments were not promulgated or approved by the Supreme Court of Minnesota and the court's earlier decision had specifically addressed the issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the District Court, Nicollet County (Minnesota), that denied his motion for post-conviction relief from a sentence imposed for a conviction for possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. He had been sentenced to an executed term of 48 months in prison and a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.023, subd. 2(2) (1990), which provided for a sentence for the possession of 10 grams of cocaine identical to that for the sale of 10 grams of cocaine, was a violation of due process because it imposed a presumption that a possessor of 10 grams of cocaine had an intent to sell the cocaine. The court held that appellant's due-process rights were not violated by the enforcement of &sect; 152.023, subd. 2(2) (1990) and the Minn. Sentencing Guidelines. Also the court ruled that because the post-conviction petition only involved an issue of law an evidentiary hearing was not necessary. Lastly, the court ruled that appellant was not prejudiced by the trial court's failure to give the State an opportunity to respond to his post-conviction petition because to have relief on appeal a party had to show that he had been prejudiced by a tribunal's action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police discovered marijuana plants growing in a wooded area near defendant's house. Following his convictions of several drug related offenses, defendant argued on appeal that the warrantless search of his property was unconstitutional, as the area where the marijuana was found growing was within the curtilage of his residence. The court held that the area was beyond the curtilage of defendant's residence, as it was outside of the cleared and mowed area used as a lawn and no steps had been taken to protect the area from observation. Defendant also asserted that his Fourth Amendment privacy rights were violated when the police officer left the sidewalk and walked across his lawn. Defendant contended that the evidence seized pursuant to the search should be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the evidence seized pursuant to the search was admissible. The court reasoned that there was no flagrant violation of defendant's rights and that the marijuana growing in an open field could have been discovered by other means.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction of aggravated robbery, Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.245 (1990), from the District Court of Hennepin County (Minnesota).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued he was denied due process because the aggravated robbery statute was vague and ambiguous. The court stated it was clear that a person who committed a robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon or inflicted bodily harm was guilty of aggravated robbery under &sect; 609.245. Simple robbery under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.24 required only the use of force or threatening the imminent use of force to overcome a person's resistance. It does not require bodily harm. Both statutes had specified standards of conduct. Defendant failed to show the aggravated robbery statute was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt and thereby was not denied due process. Defendant's argument for lenity, that a court should apply the least harsh statute when different statutes describe the same behavior, failed because the two relevant statutes described different behavior. Defendant also claimed the trial court erred when it refused to give jury instructions on the definition of force and on lesser included crimes. Because this case was heard by the trial court and not by a jury, the court did not reach that issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sales representative filed a demand for arbitration after the manufacturer terminated the oral sales agreement and refused to participate in arbitration. The manufacturer then filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that &sect; 325E.37 did not apply to the agreement or that the statute was unconstitutional. The arbitrator held that the agreement fell within the scope of &sect; 325E.37 because it was a renewed agreement. The trial court granted the sales representative's motion for summary judgment and ordered the parties to proceed with arbitration. The manufacturer appealed and asserted that &sect; 325E.37 was unconstitutional and inapplicable. The court determined that the provisions of &sect; 325E.37 that precluded judicial review of the compulsory arbitration decision was unconstitutional based on the due process guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court concluded that due process required a minimal level of judicial review of compulsory binding arbitration decisions. The court severed the unconstitutional provision of the statute and remanded the case for arbitration because the remaining provisions of &sect; 325E.37 were applicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sales representative filed an arbitration demand with the association after the manufacturer terminated their agreement. Thereafter, the manufacturer filed its action against respondent, and the trial court granted respondents' motions to dismiss. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that because Minnesota did not recognize a prima facie tort action in the context of a proceeding for the wrongful initiation of arbitration proceedings, the claim was properly dismissed. Additionally, the manufacturer's abuse of process claim was properly dismissed because arbitration was not demanded to prevent the manufacturer from having its day in court; rather, at the time the sales representative filed its arbitration demand, Minn. Stat. &sect; 325E.37, subd. 5 (1990) required the sales representative to submit its claim to arbitration. The court found that dismissal of the conspiracy claim was also proper because it was dependent on the prima facie tort and abuse of process claims, both of which were properly dismissed. Finally, the court held that the association and its employees were immune from civil liability claim, and thus, the claims against them were properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Appellants' action challenged the constitutionality of the Governor's veto of 1991 Minn. Laws 2895 (&quot;section 5&quot;).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vetoed legislation redirected the division and distribution of proceeds of the tax on taconite and iron sulfides. On appeal from the judgment in favor of respondents, appellants argued that section 5 was not imposed upon an item of appropriation and was therefore an improper exercise of the veto power. The court agreed and reversed the judgment. It held that section 5 was not an item of appropriation, defined as a separate and identifiable sum of money appropriated from the general fund dedicated to a specific purpose. The court reasoned that since section 5 merely authorized the transfer of the tax increase funds from the economic and environmental funds to the higher education services, it involved no new appropriation of a separate and identifiable sum. It also reasoned that the Governor's veto power was limited to items of appropriation, not of a part or parts of an item, and that the bill involved an individual allocation that was only part of an item. The court concluded that because the funds in question were to be paid over to the residuary, which did not involve the general fund, the expenditure did not &quot;appropriate&quot; money otherwise available for state purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his sentence, and the court affirmed the trial court's finding that defendant fit the statutory definition of a patterned sex offender. However, because defendant raised the issue of the constitutionality of the patterned sex offender's statute for the first time on appeal, the case was remanded to the trial court for an initial determination of the statute's constitutionality. On remand, the trial court concluded the patterned sex offender statute was constitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court noted that the patterned sex offender statute did not take defendant's sentence outside the constraints of the sentencing guidelines, but rather was authorized by the sentencing guidelines, and concluded that the reasonableness standard in the patterned sex offender statute met due process requirements. The court also concluded that the statute was clear and definite enough to warn a person as to what conduct was punishable and how severe the punishment might be. Persons of ordinary intelligence could read the statute and determine what would subject them to enhanced punishment. Therefore, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Prior to the completion of a prison sentence, a petition was filed to commit him as a psychopathic personality. The trial court based its order on testimony from several mental health professionals, each of whom considered the patient to be at high risk to reoffend against young boys if released; the hospital's 60-day report agreed, and the trial court committed the patient for an indeterminate period. The court affirmed the judgment. It held that the findings and the record provided clear and convincing evidence that the patient met the standards of Minn. Stat. &sect; 526.09 for commitment; that the fact that the trial court did not use the precise words used by the Minnesota Supreme Court to define the term &quot;psychopathic personality&quot; was not determinative; and that the trial court did not clearly err in its order.

At the sentencing hearing, the inmate requested a dispositional departure from the presumed sentence and argued that placement in residential treatment, would make him less likely to reoffend. The lower court granted the inmate's motion for dispositional departure and placed him on probation for 15 years. Several conditions were imposed on the inmate's probation, including that he enter and complete an in-patient sex offender treatment program. The county refused to fund the treatment and the inmate, because he was indigent; the lower court revoked his probation and executed a 34-month prison sentence. On review, the inmate asserted that the lower court abused its discretion and violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Minnesota Constitutions when it revoked his probation and executed the sentence. The court affirmed. The court ruled that based on Minn.

The trial court was not clearly erroneous in determining that the felon met the statutory requisites for commitment. The challenges to the constitutionality of the statute failed, as the statute was not void for vagueness, did not deny equal protection, and was not violative of procedural due process.

The court ruled that an argument challenging the constitutionality of the rule was not preserved for review and any error was harmless. The court stated that pursuant to common law, convictions for sexual assault were routinely upheld with no corroboration of the complainant's testimony. The court further held that a medical report indicating that the complainant had herpes was not admissible to controvert a contention that she went to the hospital due to a fear she was pregnant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a teachers' pension plan and others, contested the summary judgment that the District Court for Hennepin County (Minnesota) entered in favor of respondent State of Minnesota in appellants' declaratory judgment action regarding the constitutionality of 1975 Minn. Laws ch. 306, &sect; 30 in its effects on the teachers' pension plan under 1909 Minn. Laws ch. 343.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that 1975 Minn. Laws ch. 306, &sect; 30 effected an unconstitutional impairment of contracts under the federal and Minnesota Constitutions. The trial court denied appellants' motion for summary judgment and granted that of the State. Appellants sought review but secured no relief. The court's survey of the history of 1909 Minn. Laws ch. 343 and its several amendments led the court to conclude that the legislature did not create a contractual right to employer contributions to the retirement fund in an amount that would maintain the actuarial soundness of the fund. Similarly, 1909 Minn. Laws ch. 343 did not promise that a fund, if created, would receive funds raised through taxation by state or local taxing authorities; it only stated that a plan could include a provision that a portion of said fund was to be raised by taxation upon the property of the said city. These considerations showed that, under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, appellants did not have contractual rights to pensions under 1909 Minn. Laws ch. 343. Therefore, no unconstitutional impairment of contractual rights occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction entered in the District Court of Hennepin County (Minnesota) for failing to provide his animals with necessary water or shelter in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 343.21(2) (1990). He contended that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it lacked sufficient definiteness to allow him to conform his conduct to the statute, and that the evidence did not support the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of one count of failing to provide his animals with necessary water or shelter in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 343.21(2). The court affirmed and found that defendant was not entitled to an order striking the State's brief on the ground that its reference to a prior district court case involving defendant was an improper use of evidence outside the record. Although defendant was a party in the previous district court action that involved the same issue presented in the appealed case, that did not preclude the court from considering the decision rendered in that earlier district court action. The court rejected his challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 343.21 and found that it was not overbroad or vague. The statute's language prohibiting behavior depriving an animal of &quot;necessary&quot; food, water, or shelter adequately described the proscribed conduct and did not require the death of an animal in order to find that defendant had violated the statute. In addition, the evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of violating the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 609.344, subd. 1(k) and 609.345, subd. 1(k) were vague, ambiguous and were misused by the state. Because the statutes were subject to reasonable construction and established adequate guidelines to govern law enforcement, the court concluded Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 609.344, subd. 1(k) and 609.345, subd. 1(k) satisfied due process requirements and were not void for vagueness under either the federal or the state constitution. The court disagreed with defendant's argument that the search warrants for records at his clinic were insufficiently specific as to the items to be seized, and thus amounted to a prohibited &quot;general&quot; warrant. The search warrants were sufficiently specific and were supported by probable cause. The trial court's change of venue over his objection did not violate his constitutional right to be tried by an impartial jury of the county or district wherein the crime was committed. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence that he engaged in sexual misconduct with his cousin. However, the court found that an 18 year sentence unfairly exaggerated the criminality of defendant's conduct and modified the sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Becker County District Court (Minnesota) that convicted him of second-degree assault in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 609.222 and 609.11 (1990), arguing that the gun found in his car was improperly introduced into evidence because it was the product of an illegal search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After receiving notice of a shooting, police presented to the scene and pursued defendant. Defendant drove to his home, parked his car near the house, went inside, and refused to answer the door. The police obtained a warrant to search the &quot;premises&quot; for the gun, but the words &quot;motor vehicle&quot; were crossed off on the warrant. Despite this, police searched the vehicle and recovered the gun. Defendant ultimately surrendered and was charged with second-degree assault. At trial, the district court admitted the firearm into evidence over defendant's objection. Following his conviction, defendant appealed, challenging the admission of the gun. In affirming, the court rejected defendant's unconstitutional seizure argument. The search warrant authorized a search of the premises, and this permitted a search of any vehicle owned or controlled by the owner of, and found on, the premises. Although the words &quot;motor vehicle&quot; were crossed off on the warrant, this did not make the search unconstitutional but merely indicated that the general object of the search was the premises, not the automobile.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the statute under which he was indicted was unconstitutionally vague, and made a motion to dismiss the first degree murder portion of the indictment. The trial court denied the motion but certified a question to the appellate court as important or doubtful pursuant to Minn. R. Crim. P. 28.03. In remanding the case for trial, the court declined discretionary review of the case. The certified question was not ripe for decision because the court was to assume facts that were not in existence to establish an element of the crime. Further, the issue could be preserved for appeal if defendant was convicted. Also, the certified question dealt imprecisely with facts that the State was to prove at trial, and the case did not present a fully developed substantive issue ripe for decision. Because the court was to evaluate defendant's vagueness argument as applied to the facts of the case, it could only review the vagueness of the statute by assuming facts not in existence. Therefore, it was inappropriate to base its analysis of unconstitutionality upon such assumption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee challenged a decision of the District Court, Hennepin County (Minnesota), which granted summary judgment after remand from the state supreme court to respondent employer in a wrongful discharge action the employee brought under the Whistleblower Statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 181.932, subd. 1(a) (1988), and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 (1988). The action was initially dismissed based on a previous wrongful discharge action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee worked for her employer as a social worker for 10 years until she was discharged. The employee worked in a preschool education program for children with special needs. During her tenure, the employee expressed concerns to various staff members and officials, both orally and through internal memoranda, about perceived violations of state procedures for the assessment of children. She was subsequently fired. A letter the employee received from the employer specifically noted her &quot;general litigiousness&quot; as a factor in her termination. On review, the court found that the employee made out a prima facie case by establishing that she had engaged in statutorily protected activity, that the employer took adverse employment action against her when it discharged her, and a presumptive causal connection. By reviewing the facts in the light most favorable to the employee, the court concluded that the employee raised circumstantial evidence from which an inference of pretext could be drawn and, thus, the trial court's grant of summary judgment was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court that dismissed an employee's action against an employer under the Whistleblower Statute and remanded the matter to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contractors brought an action against respondents, the Commissioner of Finance of the State of Minnesota and an intervening airline, seeking an order declaring 1991 Minn. Laws. 350 unconstitutional and enjoining its enforcement. The trial court (Minnesota) dismissed the contractors' action with prejudice due to their failure to file a surety bond pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 562.02 (1990). The contractors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1991 Minn. Laws 350 authorized bonds to finance construction of aircraft maintenance and repair facilities and to provide financial assistance to airline corporations. An interagency task force determined that a certain portion of the bonds to be sold under contracts with the airline could be used to prepay the airline's pre-existing debts and expenses. The trial court ordered the contractors to post a surety bond under Minn. Stat. &sect; 562.02 (1990). The court held that &sect; 562.02 applied to the action, as it was brought to challenge an action taken by a public body regarding the sale of bonds, and that the delay caused by the action could have resulted in loss or damage to the public. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in requiring the contractors to post the bond, as their suit, on the eve of the bond issue, resulted in a de facto injunction against the sale of bonds to the airline, thus posing a risk of damages to the public and the governmental entities involved. The dismissal of the action did not bar later suits challenging 1991 Minn. Laws. 350, as the contractors' complaint raised valid constitutional issues, and those issues were not adjudicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order dismissing the contractors' complaint with prejudice, but the court held that the dismissal of the action did not bar a similar suit brought by another taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety and a liquor manufacturer, challenged a decision from the District Court. Hennepin County (Minnesota), which granted summary judgment in favor of respondent liquor wholesaler in its suit challenging enforcement of the Department's interpretation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 340A.307, subd. 1 (1990) as requiring that liquor manufacturers sell liquor to wholesalers only if it is for use in the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The liquor wholesaler had licenses and places of business in both Minnesota and Wisconsin. It bought a substantial amount of the manufacturer's products for delivery in Minnesota and then shipped the liquor to its Wisconsin warehouse for resale there. The Department issued a memorandum stating that Minnesota law required that liquor wholesalers sell only with the State of Minnesota. The wholesale brought a declaratory judgment action against the Department and the manufacturer intervened. The trial court interpreted Minnesota's liquor control laws as requiring the sale of liquor to a wholesaler even though that wholesaler intended to ship the liquor to another state for sale in that state. On appeal by the Department and by the manufacturer, the court reversed. The court interpreted &sect; 340A.307, subd. 1 to mean that manufacturers had to provide liquor to wholesalers only if the liquor was for use in Minnesota. The court noted that the intent of the legislature was to promote competition and lower prices in Minnesota. It did not intend to deregulate liquor intended for other states and could not constitutionally have done so under the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the liquor wholesaler.</SPAN></P>
