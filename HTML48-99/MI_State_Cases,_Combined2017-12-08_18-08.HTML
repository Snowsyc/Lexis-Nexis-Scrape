</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the People failed to present evidence that was sufficient to warrant a finding of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, in that the People failed to establish that the property actually taken had a value of $ 5 or more. Defendant's second contention was that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.356a violated due process, in that the statute was so vague and standardless as to leave the trier of fact free to decide, without any legally fixed standards, what conduct constituted a crime and that there was no standard that the trier of fact could employ to measure defendant's intent with regard to the value of goods he intended to steal other than the value of the goods actually taken. On appeal, the court affirmed judgment, holding that no element of actual removing or taking needed be established or that the property in fact had a value of $ 5 or more. The court held further that the requisite intent could be inferred from the totality of the facts and circumstances disclosed by the testimony, and therefore, there was a legal standard by which the trier of fact could determine whether the requisite intent was present at the time that the vehicle was entered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant former city employee appealed a decision of the Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan), which affirmed his dismissal, after a hearing, by plaintiff Civil Service Commission of the City of Hamtramck, Mich. The employee was arrested on a drunk-driving charge, and his license was suspended after he refused to take a breathalyzer test. The employee was terminated because he had violated Hamtramck, Mich., Civ. Serv. R. &amp; Reg. XII, &sect; 5(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By driving a city truck when his driver's license was suspended, the employee was guilty of &quot;conduct unbecoming an officer or employee of the city,&quot; as prohibited by Rule XII, &sect; 5(e). On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the Commission exceeded its authority in formulating the &quot;rule&quot; that the employee was accused of violating. The Hamtramck, Mich., City Charter clearly imposed on the Commission the duty to act by establishing rules and regulations for the guidance of civil service personnel. However, Rule XII, &sect; 5(e) did not comport with the charter's mandate. The court noted that it was not enough for an administrative body to label a purported standard a rule. The rule proscribing &quot;conduct unbecoming an officer or employee of the city&quot; presented a standard so impalpable as to be no standard at all, as it did not provide meaningful guidance concerning the required mode of conduct. The court concluded that the employee had been illegally discharged and that he was entitled to immediate reinstatement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision and remanded the case. The court held that the employee was entitled to back pay for the entire period of the wrongful discharge, amounting to normal wages that he would have received while working in his regular employment, less any wages actually earned during that period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended that the complaint could not have supported the independent judgment of a disinterested magistrate as to the existence of probable cause to believe defendant guilty of the crime charged. Defendant also contended that, because that document was defective, his arrest under it constituted a violation of the rights guaranteed him by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Furthermore, because his arrest was illegal, jurisdiction over his person never attached, and his conviction was void. The court affirmed. The court found that, because the arrest warrant was based on a complaint which was conclusory and which failed to identify sources of information, it was unconstitutionally issued. The court also found, however, that defendant had not objected to the validity of the arrest warrant until appeal and thus, his objection came too late. The court concluded that defendant's appearance and plea to the information constituted a waiver of any defect in the complaint and warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff judge sought review of a judgment and an order of the Clinton County Circuit Court (Michigan), which upheld the constitutionality of a statute that prohibited the judge from practicing law other than as a probate judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge was elected to a probate court and while holding his judicial post carried on an extensive general law practice. The legislature revised the probate courts and, under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 701.3, prohibited the judge from engaging in the private practice of law. The judge brought an action to test the constitutionality of &sect; 701.3, and the trial court entered a judgment upholding the statute. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court noted that probate judges in counties located north of the Bay-Muskegon line could practice law but those south of the Bay-Muskegon line were prohibited from practicing law. The court held that &sect; 701.3 was not repugnant to Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 24, because the statute was reasonably within the title of the probate code. The court found that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 701.3 did not deny the judge equal protection of the law because the reason for distinguishing northern and southern counties was based upon population. The court concluded that the right to practice law was not a property right but a privilege granted by the state. The court found that that there was no deprivation of the judge's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prosecuting attorney (prosecutor) appealed a judgment from the trial court (Michigan) that upheld the right of defendant County Board of Commissioners (board) to hire a corporation counsel to represent the county in civil matters. The board had concluded that the prosecutor was unable to properly represent the county. The prosecutor argued that the statute relied on by the board improperly delegated the state legislature's authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board based its decision to create an office of corporation counsel on specific findings of fact including: that the volume and complexity of the county's civil litigation had increased; that the prosecutor had failed to increase the size of his civil division despite overall staff increases of 37 assistants; and, that the prosecutor was unable to properly represent the county. The prosecutor filed an action for declaratory relief and an injunction barring the board's decision. The trial court found for the board and the prosecutor appealed. The court ruled that the board had not improperly invaded the authority of the prosecutor's office, which the prosecutor argued was a co-equal constitutional office. The court ruled that the state constitution explicitly gave the legislature the power to delegate specific legislative power to county commissioners and so the prosecutor's argument that the legislature could not delegate such power was baseless. The court found that the board did not abuse its discretion in finding that the prosecutor could no longer properly represent the county in civil matters because the board had a reasonable basis for its conclusion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in favor of the board. The court ruled that because it did not appear that the board acted without a reasonable basis the prosecutor failed to prove that the board had abused its discretion in creating the office of corporation counsel.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with arson, in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.72 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.267), and the state sought to introduce the evidence collected.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner made road improvements in the area of the property owner's farm, and widened a county road that ran through the farm. The road was widened from a narrow lane of 15 feet width to a road 66 feet wide. The Commissioner did not seek to condemn the land that was taken in order to widen the road but claimed that the land was subject to an easement under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 221.20. The road-widening felled trees, tore down fences, caused the property owner's dairy business to suffer, prevented crops from growing, and caused cows to die. The property owner brought an action against the Commissioner, and the trial court entered an award in favor of the property owner. The court modified and affirmed the judgment. The court held that the six-month notice provision of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.6431 was unconstitutional. The court found that a previous action that was dismissed for procedural reasons tolled the three-year statute of limitations under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.6452. The court concluded that its earlier decision was not based on the merits of the property owner's claim and was not res judicata of the meritorious issues in the action.</SPAN></P>

Defendants sought to levy a special assessment to construct a sanitary sewer on the owners' property; hence, the owners filed an action to set aside the assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners argued that it was necessary to hold a hearing on the necessity of the sewer project before a contract for the construction and maintenance of sewage facilities was made. The owners contended that they received no notice of a hearing and were not afforded an opportunity to contest the assessment. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 123.743 controlled the dispute and stated that the person assessed could raise any and all issues at the hearing on the assessment roll and that only one such hearing was required. Defendants did not formally deny allegations that the owners were not given notice of a hearing; hence, summary judgment was improper. However, the actions of the township were presumed valid; therefore, the owners had a heavy burden of proof to overcome in order to justify setting aside the assessment. Moreover, the owners had no right to pollute and defendants were entitled to take reasonable regulatory measures to prevent pollution. Hence, if defendants established that a piece of property was a source of pollution, the detriment of other owners' property needed to be weighed against any claimed disproportion between the benefits and the assessment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist alleged that she was driving on a road maintained by the county when a large dead elm tree blew onto the truck she was driving, that the road commission was charged with the maintenance of the safety of the road, was warned that falling trees in the area made the road hazardous, that the road commission was negligent in its failure to remove potentially dangerous falling trees from the area, and that, as a result of the negligence of the road commission, the motorist was seriously injured by the falling tree. The county and road commission argued that because the tree fell on top of the motorist's truck, the county was immunized from liability because the tree was not yet on the highway. The court held that the amended complaint stated a cause of action under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1402 (Mich. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state high commission appealed a judgment of the Oakland County Circuit Court (Michigan) in favor of defendant property owners in its action to condemn a portion of their property for use in widening a highway. The trial court determined that the Property for Public Highway Purposes Act (Act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 213.361 et seq. (1966) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8.261(1) et seq.), was unconstitutional and failed to protect natural resources.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission brought condemnation proceedings under the Property for Public Highway Purposes Act (Act), but the trial court ruled that the Act was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The commission appealed, and the court reversed the judgment below, ruling that a function was properly delegated so long as its exercise was controlled by adequate standards in the statute. Eminent domain was founded on the law of necessity, and Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 213.368 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8.261(8)) required a finding of necessity for a taking. However, an absolute necessity was not required. It was sufficient that it was reasonably necessary for public convenience or advantage, although there was no fixed or inflexible rule of law by which necessity was measured. The court ruled that there was no unconstitutional delegation of power when a policy was laid down in the statute and the administrative details were left to the executive officials to bring about the results authorized. Accordingly, the standard of necessity in the Act was adequate and the Act did not violate due process. Additionally, every eminent domain law did not have to deal with environmental issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the commission's condemnation action under the Act, the court reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of the property owners that the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

One of the experts testified that his valuation was based on conversations with specific retailers who advised him that the land was not suitable to be used as a regional shopping center for valuation purposes. The landowner testified otherwise and projected significantly increased valuations on the land. During the trial, the landowner requested a continuance and asserted that he intended to produce one of the specified retailers that denied ever talking to the state agency's expert. The trial court denied the request, denied the motion for a new trial, and entered its judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. It noted that the landowner's constitutional challenge to the statute was not properly preserved for review. It found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the landowner's request for a continuance because the landowner failed to establish the required diligent efforts to secure the appearance of the witness at the trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of an Oakland trial court (Michigan), which, after a jury trial, found him guilty of conspiracy to commit an abortion. Defendant's motion for a new trial was denied. On appeal, defendant claimed that the Michigan abortion statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.14, was unconstitutional, vague in the constitutional sense, and impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was not a licensed physician, was going to perform an abortion on a woman who ultimately gave birth to a healthy, full-term baby. Defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit abortion in violation of &sect; 750.14 and on his appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that there was a sufficient State interest with regard to the health and safety of the woman to continue to justify application of the present Michigan abortion statute as applied to induced abortions performed by non-physicians. The statute was not vague in the constitutional sense, particularly given the United States Supreme Court's holding that a similarly worded statute from the District of Columbia was not vague. Section 750.14 did, however, unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof because it relieved from the prosecution the burden to prove that the operation was not necessary for the preservation of the woman's life. The court held that the prosecution was required to prove the lack of necessity in every abortion prosecution. However, such a finding was of no help to defendant because the prosecution carried its burden of proof with regard to the lack of necessity. There was no error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for conspiracy to commit an abortion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a licensed physician who performed an abortion on a woman in his office. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. Although the court held that &sect; 750.14 was not unconstitutionally vague, it concluded that the statute's intended purpose, to protect a pregnant woman's health and safety, no longer existed as applied to physicians in a proper medical setting. Medical advances made therapeutic abortions reasonably safe, and the State no longer had a sufficient interest in a woman's health and safety to support the abortion statute. The court held that a licensed physician could not be prosecuted for an induced abortion performed in a hospital or appropriate clinical setting on a woman in her first trimester of pregnancy. Defendant did not come within the exception because he failed to perform the abortion with the requisite standard of care. The court further held that the last sentence of &sect; 750.14 was unconstitutional because it impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to a defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment, holding the employers failed to meet their burden of establishing that the challenged legislation created an irrational classification sufficient to overcome the presumption of the constitutionality of the statute because the claimants were capable of working but were prevented from doing so by the lockout and not their own acts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The advertising companies challenged the validity of a city ordinance restricting the use of certain signs in the city. The trial court invalidated the ordinance in its entirety, prompting this appeal. The city claimed the trial court erred in finding the ordinance was an unreasonable exercise of the municipal police power and was vague and overly general. The court found the ordinance was not predicated on an exclusively aesthetic basis, the considerations leading to the passage of the ordinance, including the safety of the citizenry, were within the police power, and the ordinance constituted a reasonable attempt, for purposes within the police power objectives, to harmonize the use of signs with the existing land uses in the city. Therefore, the ordinance was improperly invalidated. Moreover, the comprehensive nature of the ordinance dictated against the conclusion that the ordinance was a veiled attempt to ban billboards. However, the city could not destroy, by time limitation, nonconforming uses. It also could not destroy those uses without providing just compensation.. Therefore, the amortization provision and the compensation provisions were properly held invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court partially reversed the decision invalidating the ordinance, affirming only the invalidation of two provisions of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that the ordinances did not apply to &quot;topless go-go dancing&quot; or that they were unconstitutional. The dancer stripped off two &quot;pasties&quot; that had covered the nipple areas of her breasts and danced totally nude above the waist. She was clad in black leotard tights below the waist. A police officer, who was present during the entire performance, issued a ticket to the dancer when she removed her bandaids. She was charged with indecent exposure of her person in the streets, lanes, alleys, markets, or public places of the city. The operator of that establishment received a ticket for permitting the immoral, vulgar, suggestive, improper, or freak dancing. Plaintiff alleged that it operated an establishment featuring &quot;topless go-go dancing&quot; and that if such entertainment was prohibited, its business would suffer serious economic injury. The court reversed the convictions entered under the ordinances and declared the ordinances did not prohibit topless go-go dancing. The bar was not a &quot;public place&quot; within the meaning of the ordinance. The word &quot;dancing&quot; referred to the conduct of patrons, and the word &quot;entertainment&quot; referred to the conduct of employees.</SPAN></P>

The owners contended that the 1969 amendment to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.801(k) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.2501(k)) was the exclusive means for the payment of license fees.</SPAN></P>

The trial court construed &sect; 257.801(k) favorably to the motor carriers, but denied the injunction and the vehicle owners sought review. The court remanded the matter for the entry of a declaratory judgment because: 1) the legislature intended that its authority to apportion the licensing fee could not be limited by private contract, 2) the adoption of the statute was pursuant to the welfare and interest of the state, 3) the impact of the amendment on the main thrust of the contract was slight and the state interest significant, 4) the Contract Clause did not prohibit the amendment, and 5) federal law did not preempt the field.</SPAN></P>

The provisions of the will and codicil required that political science be taught by the colleges, and that books written by the decedent be distributed. The heirs contended that because the decedent's trust was specific in purpose and beyond the doctrine of cy pres, it should have failed, and the assets reverted to them. The court affirmed the trial court, holding that the decedent's specific intent was that trust income be used to promote the teaching of political science with greater emphasis in classroom than would have been received but for his gift, and that the specific purpose of book distribution was impossible to achieve in any legitimate institution of higher learning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Mich. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, state senators held four-year terms. After the federal decennial census of 1970, the coalition learned that Michigan had undergone large population shifts since the 1960 census. It filed an action seeking a writ of mandamus directing the secretary of state to order all state senators, who were elected in 1970, to stand for election in 1972, contending that incumbent state senators represented districts that were severely malapportioned and that this malapportionment denied equal protection to voters in under-represented areas. The court denied the writ, holding that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not require state senators elected under an apportionment plan that met constitutional standards to stand for re-election at the first primary and general elections following the federal decennial census, where to do so would require shortening the incumbent senators' terms by two years. The court found that the citizens' votes were equal when they last voted for state senators in 1970 under the old apportionment plan and that they would be equal when they next voted for state senators in 1974 under the new apportionment plan.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant claimed, inter alia, that he was denied his constitutional right to confrontation when his accomplices were allowed to raise their privileges against self-incrimination in response to questions relating to the kidnapping charge and by the trial judge's limitation of defendant's cross-examination of the police officer who conducted defendant's lineup. The court affirmed the conviction, holding, inter alia, that a witness could not admit participation in a crime and then invoke the privilege to prevent defendant from challenging his testimony. However, where the accomplice waived his privilege by taking the stand and testified for the State, his refusal to answer certain questions relating to the kidnapping charge were harmless constitutional errors. Reliance on the constitutional privileges in no way hampered defense counsel's ability to fully cross-examine as to the rape charge and the errors were harmless as to it.</SPAN></P>

The Democratic Chairman, who was also a member of the Apportionment Commission claimed the apportionment plan was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission adopted a plan for the reapportionment of the county for electing the Board of Commissioners. The plan adopted possessed a higher population variance ratio than other plans considered and split more political subdivisions into more segments. The court found that the Commission failed to demonstrate on the record a good-faith attempt to achieve districts of equal population. Partisan competition did not achieve a salutary result and established an arbitrary population figure as de minimis. In so doing, it precluded the creation of districts of equal population and rejected an orderly inquiry into the proposed plans. The court concluded that the apportionment plan adopted by the Commission was in violation of the United States Constitution. The court instructed the Commission to draft a new plan for the apportionment of the Board of Commissioners that guaranteed to the people of the County of Oakland districts of equal population. The new plan adopted by the Commission had mathematically equal districts with no population variance. The court held that the Commission demonstrated a good-faith effort to achieve districts of equal population with the new plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff challenged a judgment from the trial court (Michigan), which granted defendant school district's motion for accelerated judgment, pursuant to Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 116.1(5) (1963), on the basis that the school district was a political subdivision of the state and that no verified notice had been received within 60-days after the plaintiff allegedly suffered personal injuries while at an elementary school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiff alleged that she had fallen at the elementary school suffering broken ribs, among other injuries. However, the trial court determined that the plaintiff's claim against the school district was barred by reason of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1406 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(106)), requiring notice. In addition, the jury returned a verdict of no cause of action against the remaining defendants, who were school district employees. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court granting the motion for an accelerated judgment and remanded the case to the trial court after determining that the provisions requiring notice from the plaintiff had been held in prior caselaw to clearly violate the equal protection guarantees of the Michigan and federal constitutions. Thus, in pertinent part, the court held that it was reversible error for the trial court to have granted an accelerated judgment in favor of the school district. However, regarding the employees, the court held that any error in the exclusion of an expert witness's opinion testimony regarding an ultimate question was harmless error. Accordingly, that portion of the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The commission modified the plan to correct the elongated shapes of two districts. This resulted in a maximum population difference between districts of 315. The petitioner brought an action against the commission alleging that the apportionment plan was unconstitutional. The court agreed, declared the plan unconstitutional, and remanded to the commission for the drafting of a new plan. The court held that the commission's use of an actual population count was not conducted for the sole reason permitted by Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 46.404(a). The court said that the statute was explicitly clear that the only reason that justified an actual population count for purposes of splitting a census unit was meeting the standard of districts of equal population. The statute did not permit correction of elongated districts, the court said. The overwhelming concern in the guidelines for apportionment of county boards of commissioners, the court wrote, was that the districts be of equal population. A departure from the census units for any other reason was unconstitutional, the court said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a county board of apportionment commissioners, filed an original statutory action pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 46.401 et seq. in which it sought approval of its proposed apportionment plan for the election of county commissioners. The court issued its findings and decision regarding the proposed plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county had 56 enumeration districts according to the 1970 Decennial Census. However, the apportionment commission decided it would not use the 56 enumeration districts as building blocks for commissioner districts, but rather would confine themselves to 19 units, which were made up of the county's political subdivisions. The result was that the deviation of the largest district from the average was 710, or 14.7 percent; the deviation of the smallest district from the average was 775, or 16.1 percent; and the maximum population variance ratio was 1:1.367. The court held that the apportionment plan adopted by the apportionment commission was in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court found that by publicly sanctifying the boundaries of the 19 political subdivisions and refusing to utilize census units and other techniques mandated by &sect; 46.401 et seq., the commission demonstrated its lack of good faith. The court categorically stated that there was no plan of any board size that the commission could draft along the lines of political subdivisions that would adhere to the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that (1) a prosecuting attorney was a quasi-judicial officer who was vested with and required to exercise certain discretionary powers in the administration of the criminal law; and (2) statutes covering allied offenses and degrees of offense, in which the nature of a case might make it possible for a prosecutor to bring any one of several different charges against an accused, were not invalid simply because the accused could have violated more than one of them at the same time in a transaction.</SPAN></P>

The acts of the foreign corporation fell within the prohibition of the Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 450.93 and constituted doing business in this state illegally.

Defendant gave the officer the narcotics and change from his purchase. The officer and the individual then left and the individual was dropped off on a street corner. He was never located thereafter. Subsequently, warrants were issued for the arrest of defendant. The officer entered defendant's residence to buy heroin. The officer gave defendant a marked bill to make the purchase. The police raid ensued and defendant was arrested and charged. During the trial, the individual was mentioned frequently as an eyewitness of the narcotics sale. The trial court denied defendant's motion to indorse the individual as a res gestae witness. A jury convicted defendant of the sale of narcotics. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that the refusal to indorse the individual as a res gestae witness was not clearly erroneous because he was not required to be so indorsed, as he was an accomplice.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the finding of the trial court sitting as the trier of fact, particularly when the veracity and credibility of the witnesses was at issue, would not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. The court concluded that the trial court's finding in the instant case could not be said to be clearly erroneous. Finally, the court held that upon a review of the entire record it did not affirmatively appear that the error complained of resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

On appeal, the circulator claimed that the proposal was an amendment, its passage conformed to statutory procedure, and that it was constitutional to add the city manager to the list of officers subject to voter recall. The court agreed with the city that it was unconstitutional to amend the city charter with a provision permitting the recall of a non-elective officer. The court also held that the amendment was void because the change was in fact a charter revision rather than an amendment. The court pointed out that proceedings for recall differed materially from those for removal from office. Proceedings for removal were court proceedings and those for recall were passed upon by the electors. The court held that as the proposal submitted to the voters instituted a fundamentally different method of removing a city manager, it followed that such a change in the charter would have had to been accomplished by revision rather than amendment. The court found that the proposed charter amendment would have effectively destroyed the city manager form of government. Therefore it was much more than a mere amendment of the charter.</SPAN></P>

The municipality appealed. The court was in accord with the trial judge's findings. The court held that given the housing shortage in Michigan, the use of land for multiple dwellings had to be given the same &quot;favored&quot; status that it would have if used for mobile homes. The court also held that the trial court's conclusion was amply supported by evidence that there was no possibility of developing the lots by erection of single homes except at a monetary loss, the lots in question had been platted more than 50 years before and were still vacant, and the character of the area was suited to multiple-dwelling development as indicated by the existence of multiple dwellings almost adjacent to the subject lots.</SPAN></P>

The landowners objected to the consolidation of their case with a similar case including a party not in their case. The landowners also claimed that the lower court erred in resetting boundaries established by a previous case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state director of conservation obtained an injunction against certain landowners to prevent an intended landfill into Lake St. Clair. In the lower court the case was consolidated with a similar case including a party not relevant to the landowner's case, but the lower court entered a single judgment for both cases. The landowners sought review. On review, the court found that under Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 505.1(1963), the lower court erred in entering a single judgment in the consolidated cases, and that the judgment was prejudicial to the landowners. The court also considered the landowners' argument that the lower court erred in establishing boundaries for their claim that had already been set in a previous case. The court found that res judicata was inapplicable to this situation because the landowners had no interest in the property of the previous case and were not privy to a party in that litigation. Moreover, the previous case was declared moot under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 322.701 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13.700(1)). Finally, the court found that title to submerged lands in the Great Lakes was in the state subject to public trust, and the state's duty was to protect the trust.</SPAN></P>

The property owners appealed from that decision. The court held that because the mandatory notice provisions of the ordinance were not met, the city's notice to the property owners did not comply with the ordinance, as a matter of law. Therefore, the county court erred when it presented the question to the jury for resolution. Additionally, the notice was constitutionally defective under the Due Process Clause because it did not advise the property owners of their right to a hearing before demolition of the house. The court concluded that the city's destruction of the house constituted a trespass, and reversed the county court judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Board was furnished with the federal census data, it began the task of reapportionment pursuant to the Act, which provided for the apportionment of county boards of supervisors, prescribed the size of such boards, and indicated the manner of the election of supervisors to such boards. The Board relied upon a letter opinion written by the Michigan attorney general, stating that it was the legislative intent under 1968 Mich. Pub. Acts 153 and 1969 Mich. Pub. Acts 137, which were amendments to the Act, to authorize the Board to draft and adopt a plan to reapportion. The circuit court disagreed with the attorney general and held that the Commission was the proper party to reapportion. On appeal, the court examined the legislative intent and concluded that the Act provided for apportionment by the Board only upon the initial apportionment. The court further held that all future re-apportionments, such as the subject reapportionment, were to be made by the Commission in accordance with the Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant practicing attorney challenged an order and a judgment from a Barry trial court (Michigan) in favor of the People, which found the attorney in contempt of court for refusing to accept the appointment by a circuit judge to undertake the defense of an indigent criminal defendant. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 775.16 provided for the appointment of an attorney for the defense of an indigent criminal defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney refused to accept the appointment alleging that requiring acceptance amounted to an unconstitutional invasion of a lawyer's right to due process and equal protection, amounted to involuntary servitude, and denied the criminal defendant adequate assistance of counsel. The attorney was held in contempt for his refusal. The issue on review was limited to the constitutionality of the criminal appointment system under &sect; 775.16. The power of a court to require an attorney to accept such an appointment had been historically vested in the courts at an early time in judicial tradition. Although there was no Michigan case directly on point, it had been almost universally held that, even in the absence of any compensation, requiring practicing attorneys to undertake the defense of indigent criminal defendants did not violate the attorney's constitutional rights. The United States Supreme Court held that the duty of a trial court to appoint counsel under such circumstances was clear and its power to do so, even in the absence of statute, could not have been questioned.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of a trial court, Wayne County (Michigan), which found him guilty by a jury of assault with intent to rape, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.85, and gross indecency, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.338(b). Defendant was sentenced to nine to 10 years in prison on the assault count and to four and one-half to five years in prison on the indecency count; the sentences to run concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred by admitting hearsay evidence, that the assault with intent to rape verdict was against the weight of the evidence, that &sect; 750.338(b) was unconstitutionally vague, and that, in light of contemporary mores, cunnilingus was not grossly indecent behavior. Hearsay testimony was generally not admissible because the essential right of cross-examination was absence; thus, a jury was not afforded an opportunity to test the credibility of the person making the statement. Any error resulting from the alleged hearsay testimony was rendered moot and harmless by the fact that the conversants were called as witnesses and were subjected to cross-examination and jury scrutiny. Ample evidence supported the assault with intent to commit rape verdict, and &sect; 750.338(b) was not constitutionally infirm because of vagueness. The court would not substitute its opinion as to whether an act was grossly indecent in the eyes of the community as a whole for that of a properly charged jury. Questions of community mores were properly addressed to the trier of fact or to the legislative branch of the government.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company owned retail stores that sold beer and wine and operated a warehouse for the stores. After the Commission revoked its warehouse license under Mich. Comp.

When the trial court found &sect; 436.19d&nbsp;unconstitutional and enjoined the Commission from revoking the license, the Commission appealed. The court reversed the injunction and stated that &sect; 19d(2) violated neither the Equal Protection nor Due Process of the federal and state constitutions. The court could not say that there was an unreasonable relation between the remedy, forbidding a retailer license holder from possessing a warehouse license, and a proper public purpose, to control the liquor traffic. It did not matter whether the legislature sought to promote trade stability of liquor traffic, protect smaller retailers vis-a-vis chain stores, or foster temperance. Such goals were all related to a proper public purpose, the control of the liquor traffic.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court found that the trial court was correct in applying the Supreme Court case for resolving the equal protection issue advanced by the foundation. The clear and express intention of the Legislature was to exempt domestic, nonprofit corporations from taxation. The portions of the statutes in question, which remained after severing the &quot;domestic corporation&quot; proviso were still operable and could still implement the intent manifested by the Legislature. The court found that the foundation was entitled to tax-exempt status.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court held that the record fully supported the trial court's finding that the ordinance in question bore a reasonable and substantial relationship to the health, welfare, and safety of the township. The court determined that the landowner failed in his burden to prove the ordinance was unreasonable and failed to prove that the ordinance did not bear a reasonable, substantial relationship to the health, welfare, safety, or morals of the township. The court found that the most that the landowner proved was that he was not able to derive maximum profit from his property because of the restrictions of the ordinance.

The court noted that the effect of the trial court's charge was to eliminate the jury's determination of whether fellatio between a male and a female was conduct that the common sense of society regarded as indecent and improper. The court also found that by failing to object to a jury instruction that did not involve basic and controlling issues, defendant waived the alleged error on appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Recorder's Court of Detroit (Michigan), which convicted him of taking indecent liberties with a 10-year-old girl, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.336, in a trial without a jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction for taking indecent liberties with a minor asserting that the trial court had erred in allowing the hearsay testimony of a policewoman and because the criminal statute under which he was convicted was vague. On review, the court affirmed. The court held that in sex offenses, hearsay statements made by a victim of tender years to a witness who subsequently testified to the content of these declarations were admissible as part of the res gestae of the crime if the delay from the time of the incident to the time of the conversation was adequately explained. Furthermore, this admission of hearsay was rendered harmless when the declarant of the out-of-court statement, the child, testified to and substantiated the incompetent evidence. The court dismissed the challenge to the statute noting that a penal statute, proscribing sexually offensive, anti-social conduct, was not unconstitutionally ambiguous simply because it failed to graphically outline the acts encompassed by the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with breaking and entering into a grocery store. Defendant was convicted and appealed. The court reversed the conviction. The court held that defendant's argument that evidence seized from a trailer was the fruit of an unconstitutional search and seizure failed because defendant neglected to raise the issue at the trial court level. The court agreed with defendant's contention that it was error to admit an officer's testimony regarding a telephone call made by defendant to his mother while he was at the police station, during which the officer was listening in on another extension. The case was governed by Title III of the Omnibus Crime Bill of 1968, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2510-2520, which prohibited the interception of oral of wire communications under certain circumstances with an exception to telephones used in the ordinary course of business. There was no court authorization to listen in on the call, and neither party consented to the officer's listening in. There was nothing in the record to indicate that defendant should have known someone was listening in, and the statute did not contemplate the eavesdropping as an ordinary duty of the police.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike count three. The court on appeal reversed defendant's conviction. The court held that while gasoline was capable of exploding, it was not commonly used or intended as an explosive. Gasoline was highly flammable and was used to start fires. Accordingly, the court held that it was not the intent of the legislature to classify gasoline as an &quot;explosive,&quot; when spread upon the surface of property to start a fire, under the statute.

The commission had filed a notice of discontinuance purporting to dismiss its condemnation action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The highway commission began proceedings to condemn a portion of the landowner's land for a highway construction project. The landowner filed a motion to set aside the commission's declaration of taking and the trial court's order to surrender possession. The commission then decided to terminate its efforts to acquire the parcel, and the trial court set aside the declaration of taking and its order to surrender possession. The commission filed a notice of discontinuance. The landowner then filed a motion to strike the notice and a motion for leave to file an amended response and counterclaim for inverse condemnation. The landowner alleged that the highway would infringe its easements of access, light, air and view and that pursuant to Mich. Const. art. 10, &sect; 2 (1963) the commission was required to condemn the easements. The trial court denied the landowner's motion. On appeal, the court remanded the case for further proceedings. The court ruled that the commission's right to unilaterally discontinue the proceedings depended upon whether the landowner had a cause of action for inverse condemnation and whether his exclusive remedy was to file an action in the claims court.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff then sought recovery from defendant accident claims fund (fund); however, that claim was also rejected. Plaintiff sued defendants, and the trial court entered judgment in favor of defendants. The appellate court affirmed the judgment. Plaintiff was not covered under the insurance policy because it clearly excluded coverage for bodily injury to the named insured and because that exclusion did not violate public policy. The uninsured motorist provision of the policy was inapplicable because plaintiff's injuries were not sustained from an uninsured automobile. Plaintiff could not recover from defendant fund because plaintiff's automobile was not an uninsured motor vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act, Mich. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury awarded plaintiff a negligence judgment against defendant, which also included an award of interest to be calculated from the date plaintiff filed his complaint, pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.6013 (1971). Defendant had a liability insurance policy that was issued in 1963. The policy complied with the statute in effect at that time which computed interest from the time of entry of judgment. A provision of the policy required the insurer to pay interest accruing on a verdict. Following settlement of the judgment, plaintiff attempted recovery of the interest from the insurer, who denied liability. Plaintiff filed for summary judgment. The lower court denied the motion, holding that the statute in effect at the time the policy was issued controlled. Plaintiff appealed. The court reversed finding that the Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.6013 (1971) was remedial and subject to retrospective operation and that the interest must be calculated from the date the complaint was filed. The court explained that the state did not violate the contracts clause of Mich.

Plaintiffs received workmen's compensation and sought recovery against the uninsured motorist fund, created by the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act (Act), Mich. Comp.

Defendant was granted summary judgment in one suit, but denied summary judgment in the other two suits. On appeal, the court reversed or remanded the cases to either determine or fix defendant's liability under the Act, holding that because &sect; 1129 prevented plaintiffs from recovering under the Act, but did not prevent those with private insurance from recovering under the Act, it was unconstitutionally discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

It was improper for the prosecutor to question defendant about his criminal record during cross-examination. Adopting the construction given to statutes similar to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect;&sect; 600.2158, 600.2159, the court further directed the trial judge on remand to exercise his discretion if again requested to exclude any reference to defendant's prior conviction record.

</DIV>

On further review, the court reversed and remanded to the board for a full evidentiary hearing. When the ordinance was so amended the governing test for authorizing a special use permit was completely changed. Under, the new statute a special showing was required as a condition precedent to the granting of a permit. In the former hearing, the city presented evidence of traffic hazards that would be created by the existence of a gas station. The court found that it appeared as if the city had a valid governmental interest based on the police power to reasonably deny the permit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer brought an action seeking to recover taxes paid to the City of Ann Arbor (city).

Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.97(1971)) and the taxpayer appealed. The court affirmed the trial court's order, holding that the voluntary payment of the taxes could not be recovered even if the tax was void. The effect of the payment under protest statute was to make such a payment involuntary irrespective of any question of duress. A voluntary payment could be recovered only if it was based on a mutual mistake of fact or if the taxpayer complied with the provisions of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 211.53 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.97(1971)). A failure to comply with the payment under the protest statute prevented recovery even when the trial court held that the tax was invalid before the payment had been made.

The city moved for partial summary judgment on the ground that the operation of a police department was a governmental function and it was therefore immune from liability under 1964 Mich. Pub. Act 170 &sect; 7. The victim opposed the motion claiming that &sect; 7 was unconstitutional because it violated the one-object-expressed-in-its-title provision of Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 24 (1963). The trial judge declined to hold that &sect; 7 was unconstitutional, and ruled that the words &quot;tort liability&quot; in &sect; 7 should be construed, in light of the title, to mean &quot;negligent tort liability.&quot; As so construed, &sect; 7 did not bar an action for an intentional tort, and the trial judge denied the city's motion for summary judgment. The city appealed. The court on appeal affirmed the denial of the city's motion. Subsequent to the trial court's decision, the State supreme court held that &sect; 7 was unconstitutional and did not afford the city governmental immunity for an intentional tort.</SPAN></P>

The judge had filed an action against the Board, seeking reinstatement of his retirement benefits and a refund of benefits that had been withheld from him by the Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the judge resigned his position as a probate judge, he was appointed to fill the vacancy that he had created; while serving under appointment he filed for retirement. The judge initially received full pension benefits plus a per diem salary for serving as a temporary probate court judge, but the Board subsequently demanded a refund of some of the payments the judge had received. Based upon Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;600.226 (1964), the Board asserted it was entitled to reduce the judge's benefits, and it withheld any further payments until it had recouped the amount of the alleged overpayment. The judge filed suit and successfully argued that to the extent that &sect; 226 purported to reduce his pension rights, it impaired his vested rights under the Wayne County, Mich., Retirement Ordinance (March 11, 1964). In affirming, the court held that Mich. Const. art 9, &sect; 24, prohibited the impairment of the judge's accrued retirement benefits. The judge's contractual rights in his county pension vested prior to the enactment of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;600.226 (1964) and if &sect; 226 was applied retroactively it would unconstitutionally diminish and impair his retirement pension rights.</SPAN></P>

The city was enjoined from enforcement of Ordinance 20 against plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchaser planned to develop the landowner's property as a mobile home park. The city refused the plaintiffs' request for an amendment to Ordinance 20. The plaintiffs filed claims against the city for injunctive relief from Ordinance 20. The trial court also sustained the plaintiffs' challenge to the application of Woodhaven, Mich., Zoning Ordinance 20, art. 15, &sect; 15.17(c), which limited the size of trailer parks to 75 mobile home coach sites, to their property. On appeal, the city argued that it the plaintiffs had failed to overcome the presumed validity of Ordinance 20. The court reviewed cases that held that when a municipality attempted to completely exclude a favored land use, the burden shifted to the municipality to demonstrate the validity and reasonableness of the challenged zoning regulation. Recent case law demonstrated that trailer parks were a favored use and that a blanket exclusion of trailer parks from a community was tantamount to classification as a nuisance. The city's scant testimony of land values and expert opinions on the feasibility of the property for single family residences was insufficient justification for the exclusion of trailer parks.</SPAN></P>

Even if such remarks and actions were erroneous, the court found that the errors were cured by the trial court's corrective charge that was given at the request of defense counsel. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the prosecutor misused a transcript of preliminary examination of a witness by reading excerpts to the jury. The court emphasized that the witness had testified at trial and was available for further testimony. Moreover, the court found that the prosecutor utilized the transcript because defense counsel previously used the transcript in cross-examining the witness. The prosecutor merely used the transcript to provide context for some of the witness' answers given in the preliminary examination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff doctor sought a writ of habeas corpus after he was convicted of civil contempt for failing to answer questions put to him by a grand jury after the doctor was granted immunity pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect;&sect; 767.19a, 19b (1971). The doctor was sentenced to serve six months in prison for the contempt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor claimed that a sentencing order required his release on the expiration of the grand jury's term of service, and that after the expiration, there was no forum before which he could purge himself of the contempt. Denying the writ, the court said that the doctor was not entitled to be released. Although the term of service had expired, he could still purge himself. Under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 767.19c, the court had to fix a definite period as the term of the sentence, not exceeding one year. The circuit court set the sentences at six months, minus five days in one case. A condition subsequent requiring discharge on the expiration of the term made explicit that he had to be released when he no longer had an opportunity to purge himself, expressing an intention that the sentence was conditional and that it was civil, not criminal. It was not part of the sentence, and it did not fix or change the term of the sentence. Under &sect; 767.19c, a witness convicted of contempt for neglect or refusal to appear or testify had an absolute right to have a court recall grand jurors. If the doctor wanted to purge himself, the circuit court was obliged to afford him that opportunity.</SPAN></P>

Under &sect; 49 of the act, the state created a board of tenant affairs for each city, village or township having a housing commission and operating one or more housing projects. Plaintiff tenants were granted a writ of mandamus compelling the mayor to create a board of tenant affairs, but on appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the title of the act limited such boards to cities with populations of 1,000,000 or more, but &sect; 49 required the boards without limitations as to population. The court held that the body of the act had to be reasonably harmonious with the title. Where, as here, the body of the act was broader in scope than the limitations of the title of the act, the title prevailed over the conflicting portion of the body of the act. Accordingly, under &sect; 49, the mayor could not be required to establish board of tenant affairs. Furthermore, the population restriction of the act was not arbitrary because there were many valid reasons supporting the limitation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a second petition requesting youthful trainee status. The trial court denied the petition on the ground that the Act violated due process. On appeal, the court refused to strike down the statute. The court viewed the Act as establishing an administrative procedure within criminal procedure exercisable prior to conviction at the discretion of the trial court when requested to do so by an affected youth. Up to the point of the order of disposition after assignment to the status of youthful trainee, no due process rights were involved.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a class of property owners within a city, appealed the judgment of an Oakland trial court (Michigan), which entered summary judgment in favor of defendant city in the suit filed against the city that the special assessment proceedings relative to the installation of a sanitary sewer system were void, invalid, unconstitutional, and of no effect. The city had used the one-hearing procedure pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 123.743.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city determined that it needed to install a sanitary sewer system, and it established a special assessment district. It prepared a special assessment roll.

Section 123.743 provided that if a municipality other than a county elected to raise money for a public works project by assessing the cost on benefitted lands, the municipality could fix the special assessment district, prepare a special assessment roll city, and conduct a hearing regarding the special assessment roll. On appeal, the property owners claimed that the city was required to conduct a necessity hearing in conformance with the city's ordinances and charter. The court disagreed, and held that &sect; 123.743 eliminated any city ordinance or charter provisions that affected the procedure prior to the time the assessment roll was prepared. The property owners were given an opportunity to be heard. The statute distinguished between municipal and county governments, and the classification was not unreasonable or arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 418.115; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.237(115) et seq. (Cum. Supp. 1971). Appellee was an employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were migrant workers who were employed by the employer to harvest pickles. During that employment, and within a two-week span, each employee was injured by falling on the same exterior stairway leading to living quarters supplied for them by the employer. Farm laborers such as the employees herein who were compensated on a piecework basis were expressly excluded from coverage under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 418.115(d), (e); Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.237(115)(d), (e). The precise question then is whether the creation of classes within the Act was such unreasonable and arbitrary discrimination as to deny migrant workers the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2. Inasmuch as all common-law remedies remained intact, it did not appear that exclusion of piecework farm laborers from coverage under the Act was an infringement on the employees' constitutional right to travel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a city, sought review of two judgments of the Oakland trial court (Michigan). The first judgment granted a motion for summary judgment filed by defendant, a city judge, in the city's action that sought recovery of monies paid by a county treasurer for the processing of criminal cases. The trial court's second judgment denied the city's motion that sought to have set aside and vacated partial declaratory relief granted to the judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge served as the municipal judge of the city during which period he was paid a salary by the city. In addition to the salary, the judge received a sum from the county treasurer for the processing of criminal cases that arose under state law. The city filed an action that claimed that the sums were wrongfully retained by the judge. The trial court granted summary judgment and dismissed the city's complaint with prejudice. The judge obtained partial declaratory relief on his counterclaim. The city filed a motion to set aside the declaratory relief. The trial court denied that motion, and granted partial payment of the judge's attorney's fees. The trial court then granted additional declaratory relief to the judge and ordered the city pay additional attorney fees to the judge, On appeal, the court held that: (1) the sums retained by the judge properly belonged to the city because the judge's salary was the exclusive compensation other than fees for marriage ceremonies and the administration of certain oaths; and (2) the attorney's fee award in any amount was an abuse of discretion because public officials who pursued or defended personal suit must bear their own legal expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court modified the trial court's judgment so that the judge's request for an attorney's fee award was denied. The court remanded for proceedings that were not inconsistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the felony offense of selling marijuana. He retained an attorney from another state who was admitted to practice for the purpose of defendant's case.

The out-of-state attorney was subject to the same ethical restrictions placed on state attorneys, and he violated his obligations to the trial court and defendant by failing to appear without first making a timely motion to withdraw. Although the trial court had been placed into a scheduling predicament, it was an abuse of discretion to force defendant to proceed pro se.

Comp. Laws Ann. &sect;&sect; 445.551-445.555.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1937 Mich. Pub. Acts 200 provided that it was an act to regulate the sale of second-hand watches and to prescribe the penalties for the violations of the act. Defendant was charged with selling a watch that was not properly identified as second-hand. The trial court found that the act was unconstitutional in that the object of the act was not in its title, the act was vague and indefinite in that it did not identify the trade, persons, or business that came within the act, and that it was arbitrary and capricious. The act defined a second-hand watch as one that had been previously sold to a consumer, and any watch whose case or movement, serial numbers or other distinguishing numbers or identification marks had been erased, defaced, removed, altered or covered. The court held that the additional definition was proper, and it upheld the constitutionality of the act. A one-subject act was not required to include all applicable definitions in the title. The application of the act was to any person, agent, or employee who was regularly engaged in the sale of watches. The act did not apply to casual sales. The act was not void for overbreadth, vagueness, or indefiniteness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A zoning ordinance changed the property from a commercial to a residential area. The owners' restaurant thus became a non-conforming use. In a prior action against the board seeking a permit to construct a new restaurant, the ordinance was held to constitutional and the property owners abandoned a cause of action seeking a permit to repair the buildings on the ground that both Michigan law and the ordinance allowed certain repairs to be made for non-conforming uses. After the owners were refused a building permit to make repairs so as to correct violations of state health department regulations, the owners instituted a mandamus action essentially similar to the previously abandoned cause of action. The trial court granted judgment to the board based on the doctrine of res judicata. The court reversed. The facts and evidence necessary to attack the constitutionality of the ordinance were different from those necessary to establish the owners' rights thereunder. Thus, res judicata did not bar the second action. Moreover, the board's failure to object to the abandonment of the claim in the prior case waived any right to invoke the compulsory joinder rule as a bar to this action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner, having reason to believe that the operator was involved in an accident resulting in the death of a person, was empowered to act pursuant to Mich.

The action by the circuit court was consistent with &sect; 257.323, which authorized the court to confirm, modify, or set aside such order of suspension, revocation, or denial of such license. The court agreed that where revocation of a license was sought because the driver had been involved in an accident resulting in death of a person, the &quot;good cause&quot; still had to be established by sufficient and competent evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When first seen by the police, defendants were seated in or standing by a stolen car. Defendants claimed they did not know the car was stolen and that it had been entrusted to them by an acquaintance. An officer testified that the window of a truck parked nearby had been forced and the engine &quot;hot wired.&quot; Scraps of insulation similar to that covering the wire used to hot wire the truck were found on the floor of the stolen car. Defendants were convicted of possessing a motor vehicle knowing or having reason to believe it had been stolen. The court held that, where the fact that defendants were in knowing possession of a stolen car could reasonably be inferred from the evidence, the officer's testimony was admissible. However, while the case was on appeal, the Supreme Court of Michigan ruled in another case that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.25 required an intent to fraudulently transfer title, which was admittedly lacking in the instant case. Thus, on rehearing, the court was compelled to reverse the conviction, holding that defendants were entitled on direct appeal to the benefit of the new rule of law declared after their trial even though they did not preserve the issue at trial.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws Ann. &sect;&sect; 290.608, 290.631(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a gasoline service station operator. He was convicted in the trial court for having violated the Weights and Measures Act of 1964 based on his possession for use of an incorrect measuring device for the retail sale of motor fuel. Defendant sought review in the circuit court, which granted his motion to dismiss on the ground that he was convicted under an unconstitutionally vague statute that was based on the improper delegation of legislative power. On further appeal, the court reversed, concluding that defendant was properly convicted under current law. The legislature had the authority under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 608 to confer responsibility for the regulation of gasoline measuring devices upon the Director of Weights and Measures. The Director, in turn, was properly directed to regulate in conformity with the federal standards published in National Bureau of Standards Handbook 44. Any invalid provision of the enabling law was severable under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 8.5. However, the court cautioned that adoption by reference of future legislation and rules was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an individual injured in a car accident with an uninsured motorist, sought review of a judgment of the Wayne Superior Court (Michigan) regarding its claim against defendant Secretary of the State of Michigan under the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act (Act), Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.1101 et seq. Plaintiff, a second individual injured in a car accident with an uninsured motorist, sought a writ of mandamus against the Secretary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both plaintiffs obtained default judgments against the Secretary. In the combined action, the court considered two questions: (1) whether the Secretary was estopped from raising a defense against plaintiffs' motions to require the Secretary to pay the default judgments from the Michigan Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund (Fund) because the Secretary had neither entered an appearance in nor defended plaintiffs' actions, and (2) whether the one-year written notice provision of &sect; 18 of the Act was constitutional. The court noted that a prior decision had held the notice requirements unconstitutional because the cause of action provided for by the Act, although statutory in origin, was a vested right that could not be abolished except by due process of law. The court determined that the same rationale applied to cases involving competent adults; thus, the court found that the notice provision of the Act had deprived plaintiffs of due process. Because the Act was to be liberally construed, the court refused to disqualify the second plaintiff from recovery simply because he had settled his cause of action with one of the third-party tortfeasors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted a writ of mandamus to the second plaintiff. The first plaintiff's case was remanded to the trial court for further consistent proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The treasurer decreased the judges' salaries pursuant to 1966 Mich. Pub.

Const. art. 9, &sect; 24 (1963). The court granted the petition. The court noted that the Michigan Supreme Court had recognized the right to litigate constitutional questions in a mandamus action. The court also noted that Mich. Const. art. 6, &sect; 18, para. 2, granted any county the specific right to supplement a judge's salary. The court held that while 1966 Mich. Pub. Acts 252 was not an express prohibition on county supplementation of the salaries, it effectively mitigated any attempt by counties within a circuit to provide their judges with more pay. The court found that any supplementation would automatically be nullified by a simultaneous reduction in the state salary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant civil service commission sought review after the trial court (Michigan) declared 1968 Mich. Pub. Acts 188, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 38.413a (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5.1191(13.1) (1970)) (Act), unconstitutional. Plaintiff public servants sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) to maintain the status quo, an interpretation of the Act, and a determination of the effect of the statute on various classes of employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Act No. 188 added a new section to the statute that established the Wayne County Civil Service Commission. The new section 13a provided that any employee who had held a provisional appointment or promotion in the same class for six months was to be granted regular status in the class of positions in which the appointment or promotion was held. The public servants sought a TRO, which the trial court granted, and a determination of the effect of the Act. The trial court held that the Act violated Mich. Const. art 11, &sect; 6. The court reversed and remanded. The trial court's interpretation of art 11, &sect; 6, was not supported by the clear meaning of the words of the section. Art 11, &sect; 6, did not preclude the legislature from passing an act governing administration of a local civil service system. The trial court also erred by concluding that Act No. 188 created a discriminatory classification that violated the equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. 14, &sect; 1, and Mich. Const. art 1, &sect; 2. There were two interpretations of Act No. 188. Into each of the interpretations, a reasonable legislative intent could be read; therefore, the classification created by the Act had a rational basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that declared the Act unconstitutional and remanded for further proceedings in an action that challenged application of the Act to the public servants.</SPAN></P>

The trial court conducted an examination as to the degree of murder pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.318 and determined that at most defendant could be guilty of manslaughter. Defendant then pled guilty to manslaughter, which the trial court accepted. A month later, without defendant having been sentenced, the trial court set aside the conviction, ruling the examination had been improper because defendant had confessed and pleaded guilty to a specific degree of murder. The case was reassigned to the same judge and defendant offered a plea of guilty to second-degree murder. On appeal, defendant contended he was twice put in jeopardy for the same crime. The court held: (1) because the trial court was without authority to accept defendant's manslaughter plea on its own motion, such acceptance was a nullity and the trial court properly set the manslaughter conviction aside; and (2) by defendant's plea of guilty to second degree murder, he avoided the risk of a mandatory life sentence, and thus he was bound on appeal by his bargain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court (Michigan) dismissed the People's prosecution against defendant on a charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants (Dearborn, Mich., Traffic Code Ch. 6.1(c)), based upon the trial court's finding that the provision of the Traffic Code was invalid, unreasonable, and unconstitutional because it conflicted with penalty provision set forth in Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.625(b). The People appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants. The trial court dismissed the case based upon its holding that the provision under which defendant was charged was invalid as the penalty provision set forth therein conflicted with the fine set forth in the State statute. On review, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court in part and affirmed the judgment of the trial court in part. The court agreed with defendant's contention that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.605 (the uniformity statute) prohibited a municipality from enacting or enforcing a penalty provision in an ordinance that was in conflict with the State statute. The court ruled, however, that the inclusion of the invalid penalty provision was not sufficient to invalidate the ordinance in its entirety. Thus, the court held that to the extent the penalty provision of Dearborn, Mich., Traffic Code Ch. 6.1(c) exceeded the State law, it was invalid. The court further held that, to the extent the penalty provision set forth in the ordinance was within the limits of the State law, it was valid and enforceable.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 418.101 et seq. (Cum. Supp. 1971).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sued the carrier, alleging that negligence during performance of a contract with the employer to provide safety inspections and safety engineering services had been the proximate cause of his injury. The trial court granted the carrier summary judgment, holding that the suit was barred, and that the court's prior interpretation of the Workmen's Compensation Act was incorrect. The court disagreed and reversed. It concluded that its prior interpretation of legislative intent was correct. It held that the Act allowed an employee to sue a third party whose negligence caused injury. It also held again that the workmen's compensation carrier was a &quot;third party&quot; under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 418.827(1) (Cum. Supp. 1971), the provision allowing suit against third parties. It also held that it was error to grant defendant's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a citizen's complaint, two officers were dispatched to investigate two men, sitting in a car, acting suspiciously. As the officers approached the car, the passenger side door opened and they heard something hit the ground. A .38 caliber revolver was on the grass within a foot of the passenger door. The men were ordered out of the car and the passenger was arrested. The driver consented to a search of the car and gave the officers a key to the trunk where a loaded sawed-off shotgun was discovered. The driver was also arrested. While in custody, defendants were placed in line-ups and identified as participants in an armed robbery. Defendants were convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the officers were lawfully present to make a routine inquiry of defendants based on a citizen's complaint. The discovery of the weapon, coupled with the opening and closing of the passenger side door warranted the officers' beliefs that an offense had been committed. The court held that the prosecutor was not required to prove defendants did not have licenses for the weapons because the burden of establishing a defense was upon defendants under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 776.20.</SPAN></P>

The large group then divided into two smaller ones. The officer saw defendant in the large group and again in a smaller one. Defendant was arrested and convicted of unlawful assembly and riot. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the prosecutor's remark that the jury could get &quot;these people&quot; off the streets was in bad taste, but was not so inflammatory that it deprived defendant of a fair trial. The court held that since defendant did not leave the group after the violent conduct of a riot began, it was reasonable for the officer to presume that defendant shared the group's purpose and arrest him. The court held that testimony by a police officer concerning a radio communication that said people were breaking windows at a fire station was offered to show only that as a result of the statement, the officers reacted and went to the scene. It was not offered to show the truth of the matters asserted, so it was not hearsay.

The court held that defendants were aware of the accomplice's mental problems, and that they had the opportunity to subpoena his doctors for the purpose of offering the reports in evidence. Defendants contended that the repeated adjournments of the accomplice's sentencing showed a prima facie basis to require the reversal of their convictions particularly in light of the fact that without the testimony of the accomplice a serious question of the sufficiency of the evidence would be raised.

The court examined a prior decision that did not hold the statute unconstitutional. The decision did set forth constitutional principles relating to due process and the assistance of counsel that were to be followed as a condition to a valid waiver order. The court found that the record revealed that defendant was provided a hearing as well as the assistance of counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In accordance with a city ordinance, the bookstore owners applied for a license to install four coin-operated motion picture devices on their premises. When the city denied the application, the bookstore owners filed an action challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance. On appeal of the circuit court's order upholding the ordinance as well as the denial of the application for a license, the court reversed. Noting that ordinances subjecting the exercise of freedom of speech or press to a license requirement were suspect because of the &quot;chilling&quot; effect on First Amendment rights, the court ruled that coin-operated movie machine operation was entitled to the protection of the First Amendment and that the ordinance was unconstitutional on its face. The court determined that, as drafted, the ordinance lacked the precision required of an ordinance that restrained protected First Amendment rights and conferred too much discretion on the authorities responsible for granting or denying a license under the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the state argued that defendant had a right to a transcript at public expense while he had available an appeal as of right, however, that that right was lost by defendant's failure to take a timely appeal as of right and that he was, therefore, not entitled to a transcript for use in a discretionary appeal. However, the court held that there was no constitutional requirement that a state provide any form of appellate review of a conviction, but once any appellate or post-conviction proceeding had been established, an indigent would not be foreclosed from any phase thereof because of his poverty. Further, the court held that there was no presumption that defendant's failure to take a timely appeal as of right resulted in the loss of any rights incident to the right to delayed appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff traffic offender, on behalf of others similarly situated, challenged an order of the Wayne County Circuit Court (Michigan), which refused to allow traffic offenders in the class to be released upon the deposit of a 10 percent bail bond. The traffic offender argued that this was an unconstitutionally deprivation of the right to post bail under the Bail Deposit Act, codified at Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 780.61 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The traffic offender claimed that the lower court was improperly holding prisoners that had been arrested on minor infractions under the Bail Deposit Act (act), and that so long as the traffic offenders signed a bail bond and posted 10 percent, they should have been released under the act. The court agreed. The court found that although the traffic offender had been released, the class was still intact because the incidents were commonly capable of repetition, while constantly evading review because of the fluid nature of bail hearings. However, the court said that under the act, the courts were required to release those persons who met the statutory definitions, and that it was against the act to require a person arrested to post a surety bond when the act clearly provided that only a bail bond with 10 percent was required. All persons charged with a traffic offense or a misdemeanor were entitled to be released on reasonable bail. The court said that when the lower court refused to extend the act, only to the traffic offender the lower court reversibly erred. The court modified the order to apply to all similarly situated traffic offenders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured filed suit pursuant to the section of the Liquor Control Act commonly referred to as the Dramshop Act, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 436.22 (1970), and alleged that the innkeeper wrongfully served liquor to an intoxicated person who subsequently hurt him. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the innkeeper on the ground that the action was barred by the two-year limitation period contained in the act. On appeal, the injured argued that the limitations portion of the Dramshop act was beyond the scope of the title of the Liquor Control Act, and was, therefore, unconstitutional. The court disagreed and held that since the act created a right of action, the limitation period therein contained was to be construed as a limitation on the right itself. Accordingly, the limitations period was sufficiently germane and incidental to the creation of the civil remedy to be embraced within the title of the Liquor Control Act. Therefore, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Although defendant presented a story that contradicted his guilt, the court said that the jury also heard sufficient evidence to convict him. Second, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it permitted a witness who was not indorsed on the information to testify. The court noted that the witness had been disclosed to defendant's previous counsel and that no objection to her testimony was made in the trial court. Third, the court held that no prejudice resulted to defendant from the People's impeachment of their own witness. Fourth, the court rejected defendant's claim that a remark made by the prosecutor in his closing argument was reversible error. The court said that the remarks did not show a clear case of abuse.

Initially defendant argued that choosing the jury pool from the tax rolls violated his constitutional rights of due process, equal protection, and trial by an impartial jury because it arbitrarily and systematically excluded non-property owners. The court found that tax rolls provided a comprehensive list of prospective jurors and did not exclude any group of people to such a degree that the resultant jury was not reasonably representative of the community. The court also held that jury selection based on political subdivisions did not per se discriminate against blacks, and that, without evidence of the actual racial makeup on previous jury panels, defendant failed to meet the necessary burden of proof. In addition, the court rejected defendant's claim that an in-court identification was tainted because the witness saw defendant committing the charged crime. The court also upheld a jury instruction made during the cross-examination of a State's witness because a trial court could instruct the jury on any point of law at any stage of a trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two others attempted to rob a restaurant and bar. Rather than charging defendant with robbery, defendant was charged with and convicted of assault with intent to rob. Relying on Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 768.32, defendant argued that the jury should have been instructed on the lesser included offense of attempt to commit the offense. The court held that &sect; 768.32 did not apply to all crimes. Assault was defined as an attempt to do bodily hurt to another. Crimes such as assault were themselves attempts, and defendant could not be charged with an attempt to make an attempt. Furthermore, no lesser included offense instruction was required where there was a total absence of evidence to support it. Defendant could not complain on appeal of the fact that he was returned to the scene of the crime where he was identified by the victim because he had not raised the issue in a pretrial motion to suppress. Attempted armed robbery was not a lesser included offense because it included elements that assault with intent to rob or steal did not. The crime of assault was complete when the assault was made; attempted robbery required an abortive attempt to take property from the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners commenced an action after the commission failed to approve a site plan to construct dwellings. The parties entered into a revised site plan agreement, which was embodied in a judgment, to locate two of the four proposed buildings outside the path of the proposed widening of an abutting road. Due to a mistake by the property owners' planning consultant, it appeared that there was 69 more feet in the existing right-of-way than actually was available. The two buildings were therefore partially constructed in the path of the proposed widening. The court set aside the agreement and judgment because the agreement was based on the mutual mistake that the two buildings could be relocated outside of the path of the proposed road widening and the setback. The court adjudicated the rights of the parties as if there was no agreement or judgment. The court held that the zoning enabling legislation did not authorize the city planning commission to require that the property owners' land be set aside without compensation for possible future condemnation in order to avoid increased costs of condemning the land in the future. The court dissolved the injunction.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that for the privilege of being authorized to do business in Michigan, the corporation was required to pay a franchise fee. The court found that the amount of such fee was determined from the paid-up capital and surplus of the corporation apportioned to Michigan. The court held that the error in the trial court's finding was that it failed to take into account the corporation's interstate business originating in Michigan, a factor the corporation conceded to be appropriate. The court stated that the finding considered only the corporation's intrastate activity and ignored its interstate activity originating in Michigan.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two boys testified that defendant performed anal intercourse upon them. The boys, age six and ten testified that defendant threatened to kill them if they revealed the incident. Six days after the act, the boys reported the crime to the police. On appeal from his conviction, defendant challenged the admissibility of the boys' testimony on the basis that the delay between the alleged act and the complaint rendered their testimony valueless. Defendant also argued that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel, and that the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed, holding that the delay in the reported sex offense was justified because threats of intimidation had been made against the boys. Further, the court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict. The court reasoned that each boy corroborated the other's testimony concerning the act. Further, the court held that defendant received a fair trial and was adequately represented by counsel. Finally, the court concluded that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.158 merely proscribed the common law crime of sodomy and was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating the comminuted meat law, and it appealed. Defendant claimed that the lack of a prescribed method of measurement of fat content rendered &sect; 289.582 so vague and uncertain to be unconstitutional. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court found that the fat content of the hamburger sold by defendant was ascertained by weight analysis. It was true that there could have been other methods of fat measurement than by weight. However, the record disclosed that a volume analysis would have found a higher fat content in the specimen taken. The record also disclosed an accepted practice of fat measurement by weight. The uncontradicted testimony of the State's chemist was that there was no other published method of analysis. Accordingly, there being one accepted method of fat analysis by weight, &sect; 289.582 could not have left those dealing in comminuted meats in doubt as to their statutory obligation. Because there was conflicting testimony of whether defendant told an inspector that it was selling meat loaf rather than hamburger, a jury resolved the issue in favor of the State.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment. The court found that although prejudice could have resulted, the probative value of the other acts evidence outweighed the conjectural prejudicial effect and to allow such testimony into the trial did not result in a reversible abuse of discretion. The court determined that the trial court did not commit error in allowing the camera into evidence as an exhibit. The court stated that Mich. Comp.

The same day the principal told the teacher that her contract would not be renewed.. A postal employee attempted delivery of the certified letter but the teacher was at school. A mail-arrival notice was left in her mailbox. The State Tenure Commission ordered that the teacher be returned to her employment. The trial court vacated the order, and the teacher appealed. The court held that the certified mailing of the written notice satisfied the 60-day requirement of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. Cum.

Defendants argued that the Michigan obscenity statute conflicted with the restrictions on state action imposed by U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. One defendant additionally asserted that the state statute violated Mich. Const. art 1, &sect;&sect; 5 and 17 (1963).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld defendants' convictions under Mich. Comp. Law Ann. &sect; 750.343a (Mich. Stat. Ann &sect; 28.575[1] (1970)). The court found that the material at issue, taken as a whole, had a strong tendency to arouse lustful thoughts and sexual desires in the average person in the community and that the material was offensive to the common conscience of the community. The court rejected defendants' arguments that the statute offended their due process rights and their right to free speech. In the absence of any definitive ruling by the United States Supreme Court, the court proposed a test to determine the free speech right of a defendant in an obscenity trial. The test was: Given that the published material was obscene within the meaning of a state statute, not void for vagueness, the publisher of the material lost any claim to protection under the First and Fourteenth Amendments if his primary intent in publishing the material was to appeal to the recipient's prurient interest in sex. Thus, what was punished was not the prurient thoughts provoked by the material, but a defendant's intention to provoke such thoughts and his exploitation of the provocative nature of the material.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions of defendants in the prosecutions under the state obscenity statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The welfare recipient appealed from the decision of the state social services department to reduce the benefits he received under the program to aid the blind by the amount of his Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. The circuit court affirmed the reduction in benefits, and the welfare recipient appealed from that judgment. The court first held that under the Due Process Clause, the welfare recipient was entitled to an evidentiary hearing and a decision before the reduction in his aid-to-the-blind benefits was made effective. The welfare recipient's interest in avoiding the reduction of his benefits was not outweighed by the governmental interest in summary adjudication. The court also rejected the state social services department's assertion that no issue of fact or judgment was involved. Turning to the merits of the case, the court found that the Social Security Disability Insurance benefit was not earned income, for purposes of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1201(a)(8). Therefore, the reduction in the welfare recipient's aid-to-the-blind benefits by the amount of Social Security Disability Insurance benefits received was reasonable.

Defendant filed a police report stating that a car had been stolen from the dealership. Defendant was found driving the car a few weeks later when he was stopped by a police officer for speeding. When the officer determined that the car was stolen, defendant told the officer that he had borrowed it from a friend. It was later determined that the friend was in jail when the car was stolen. Defendant was convicted for possession of a stolen motor vehicle in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.254. Defendant claimed on appeal that the information was so deficient that the guilty verdict was immaterial, that the trial court improperly admitted hearsay evidence, and that the trial court should have charged the jury as to guilty knowledge. The court rejected defendant's claims. The court ruled that the information adequately informed defendant that he was charged for a violation of &sect; 257.254 and that defendant had waived the remaining claims because they were not raised in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1967 Mich. Pub. Acts 306, &sect; 1, provided that any information filed by an applicant should not be disclosed by the Board to anyone without permission of the applicant. The provider argued that 1967 Mich. Pub. Acts 306, &sect; 1, denied him due process of law and that the nondisclosure provision was not a valid exercise of the police power, that 1967 Mich. Pub. Acts 306, &sect; 1, violated the equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2 (1963), and that the application forms become financial records that should be public records and open to inspection under Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 23 (1963), when they were stamped with the amount paid and the date. The court found that the loss of reputation and the prejudicial effect on job opportunities for an applicant who had failed the exam that would flow from a disclosure were detrimental enough to the general welfare to justify 1967 Mich. Pub. Acts 306, &sect; 1. In light of the broad scope of discretion that the legislature had when making classifications, 1967 Mich. Pub. Acts 306, &sect; 1, could not be said to be essentially arbitrary. The imprinted applications were documents and not financial records.</SPAN></P>

The city planner testified that service stations were prohibited in the district because they interfered with pedestrian traffic and were incompatible with the city's master plan. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the company failed to prove that the ordinance in question was unreasonable. Furthermore, the zoning ordinance was not unreasonable because it excluded gasoline stations in an effort to continue a desirable trend of development, guarantee the continued attractiveness of the community and enjoyment of surrounding property, assure the comfort of the populace, and reduce congestion and disorder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was employed as a bartender and took money belonging to the owner. He admitted to taking the money and promised the owner that he would repay the money, but later refused. On appeal, defendant argued that the first paragraph of &sect; 750.174 required that intent be proven, while the second paragraph provided prima facie proof of intent. He contended that such an ambiguous position should be resolved by requiring the prosecution to prove intent. The court held that the second paragraph of &sect; 750.174 made easier the prosecution's task of proving intent in embezzlement cases by means of the presumption of one fact from another fact that had already been established. The presumption of intent to embezzle was a rationally presumed fact and was more likely than not to flow from the basic or proved fact of the failure, neglect, or refusal to pay such money on demand. Furthermore, in addition to the statutory presumption regarding intent, the record contained evidence of the fact that defendant took his employer's money without consent and disposed of it by gambling at a racetrack. Moreover, &sect; 750.174 did not violate an individual's rights of equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the legality of the sentence, claiming that the trial court penalized him for exercising his right to a trial by jury. Defendant's attorney contended that it was common knowledge among members of the bar in the county in which defendant was convicted that a defendant who pleaded guilty to escape would receive no more than a one and one-half year minimum sentence, while one who requested a trial by jury would receive at least a two-year minimum. The State conceded that judges in the county did impose a harsher sentence on defendants who requested a trial by jury. The court found that the trial court violated the Fourteenth Amendment by penalizing defendant with a harsher sentence for choosing to exercise his constitutional right to a trial by jury. The sentencing policy of the county courts was also violative of the spirit and intent of the indeterminate sentence law because the legislature intended that the sentencing court fit an indeterminate sentence, in the exercise of its discretion, to the needs of the particular case and the requirements of society.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed on appeal that the trial court was not authorized to allowed the State's psychiatrists to evaluate him and that the evaluations were unconstitutional. The court rejected defendant's claims. The court ruled that the trial court had the inherent right to order the psychiatric examination by the State's psychiatrists and that the examination did not per se violate defendant's Fifth Amendment rights because the purpose of the examinations was not to obtain facts concerning defendant's participation in the crime but to obtain relevant data germane to the question of defendant's sanity.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also claimed that the habitual offender's act, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 769.11, was unconstitutional because a defendant sentenced pursuant to it was being punished twice for the same crime. The court again disagreed, finding that the statute was in no manner ex post facto; it was the subsequent offense, not the first offense, committed while the act was in effect that was punished more harshly. Defendant next argued that the delay of 14 days between his arraignment and the preliminary examination deprived him of his right to a speedy examination as required by Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 766.4. The court found that the delay, if any, was caused by defendant himself and was too short to have been prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order of the Recorder's Court of Detroit, Traffic and Ordinance Division (Michigan), which entered his conviction for wilfully failing to obey the order of a police officer, acting in the lawful performance of his duty, to bring his motor vehicle to a stop, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.602a (1970 Cum. Supp.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant drove his car through a red light. Police officers pulled their car alongside his and motioned for him to pull over. The traffic light turned green and defendant drove on. The officers approached defendant's car with their blue light on. They again motioned defendant to the curb. Defendant made a right-hand turn and proceeded to go the wrong way down a one-way street. The officers turned on their siren and followed. Defendant drove through a red traffic light. Again the officers pulled alongside defendant and motioned him to stop. Defendant continued driving until his car was stopped when it rammed into the right front fender of the squad car. Defendant argued that &sect; 257.602a was unconstitutional because the stopping of a motorist was an arrest and the statute authorized an officer to arrest for no reason at all. The court held that the conviction was proper because the mere stopping of a motorist by a police officer was not an arrest. The term &quot;arrest&quot; was used in a technical sense to mean a seizure of an offender to answer for a crime. The court also rejected defendant's assertion that he was not signaled to stop within the meaning of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court found that it was a valid legislative option to have included a test that was provable from extrinsic evidence of all the circumstances under which the property came into the possession of the accused, leaving the reasonable inferences therefrom to be drawn by the trier of the facts. The court noted that the information charged an offense under Mich. Comp.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landowners challenged the decision of the trial court (Michigan), which found in favor of plaintiff county and held that a zoning ordinance, enacted pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 125.201 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5.2961(1) et seq. (1969), was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance prohibited the landowners from placing mobile homes on their property, and they applied for a variance to permit a mobile home on their property. The request was denied by the county administrator, and later by the county zoning board. The landowners did not appeal the decision, but instead moved a mobile home on their property. The county brought an action to enjoin them from violating the ordinance. The landowners counterclaimed that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the counterclaim on the ground of res judicata because the landowners had not appealed from the decision of the zoning board of appeals. The court reversed, holding that prosecution of the application for a variance before a board of appeals did not constitute a bar to a subsequent action to declare the ordinance invalid as unconstitutional. The same was true even if the same facts were alleged as the basis for the action that were previously set forth as the basis for the claim of unnecessary hardship. The counterclaim was not an action to review the board's determination. It was a separate action challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As there was no statement on the record by defendant specifically waiving the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, the sole issue on appeal was whether the trial court complied with the constitutional requirements in accepting defendant's guilty plea as set forth in Boykin v. Alabama. The court held that the entry of the plea of guilty was made voluntarily as it complied fully with all the requirements of the Michigan statutes and court rules and with all the federal constitutional requirements. Analyzing Boykin under the decision of Brady v. United States, the court concluded that the Brady decision made clear that Boykin did not require that waivers of each of the enumerated federal constitutional rights, including the right against compulsory self-incrimination, be on the record before the trial court accepted defendant's guilty plea. In addition, the court further observed that the record presented a typical non-silent record of plea bargaining, which was a recognized form of trial strategy. In so ruling, the court noted that defendant guilty plea to a second count of breaking was entered under a reduced penalty of five-years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A petition for annexation of an irregular parcel of land to the city was filed. Approximately 160 qualified electors were excluded by the irregularly drawn boundaries. An annexation election was held, and the majority of the votes were against annexation. The citizen sought to set aside the election. The trial court ruled that because there was nothing in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 117.9 as to shape or size of the land to be annexed, it was without power to review the annexation as to the shape of the parcel. The court held that the parcel was not contiguous and that the configuration of the parcel was not totally beyond judicial review. The court found that there was an obvious gerrymandering of territory. It could not allow the obvious intent of the legislature in &sect; 117.9 to be skirted by the gerrymandering practice of technically observing that law while tacitly avoiding its plain intent. The parcel for annexation lacked the contiguity and compactness necessary to the efficient and effective operation of municipal services as a result of the gerrymandering that also denied some 160 qualified voters an effective voice in the annexation proposal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The car in which defendant was a passenger was stopped, and the car and his person were searched by police officers on the basis of two informants' &quot;tip&quot; that defendant and two other persons were transporting narcotics by car. One of the informants had on numerous occasions given the police information leading to convictions. As the occupants were ordered out of the car, an arresting officer opened a back door and observed four bags of heroin on the floor where defendant was seated. Additional drugs and paraphernalia were found in a search of defendant's person. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress this evidence and to quash the information for lack of probable cause to make the arrest. The court held that the People brought forth testimony in a hearing before the trial that the arrest of the defendant without a warrant was based on probable cause and was lawful and that the search and seizure having been made incident to that lawful arrest were valid and the evidence properly admitted. In reviewing the record and the testimony, the court found sufficient evidence presented which, if believed by the jury, would justify a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought suit against defendant for injuries she received during her physical education class at defendant's school district. Plaintiff was injured while she was performing a gymnastics exercise on a mini-trampoline. Defendant raised the defense of immunity pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1401 et seq. The circuit court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, plaintiffs contended that defendant should not have been entitled to immunity. The court held that for purposes of tort liability, school districts were state agencies. Since plaintiff incurred her injury during her physical education class, it occurred within the governmental function of the school district; thus, the immunity doctrine applied. The mini-trampoline was not part of the building and the fact that defendant purchased insurance did not preclude it from raising the immunity defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor purchased rats and mice to use in the testing of compounds for a manufacturer. It reported the purchases to the department as exempt from sales and use taxes by virtue of &sect; 4(g). The department assessed a use tax and a penalty against the contractor, who eventually sought judicial review. The trial court granted summary judgment to the department and the contractor appealed, claiming that it was entitled to the exemption for items purchased and used in carrying on testing and experimental work as a part of &quot;industrial processing.&quot; The department contended that research expenditures were not a part of industrial processing. The court agreed with the contractor, explaining that a manufacturer had to test its products to comply with federal law, to avoid litigation, and to keep down the costs of insurance. Thus, it concluded that the tests that the contractor was performing were &quot;an essential part of the process of manufacture,&quot; whose costs would be added to the final cost of the product. As the intent of the exemption was to avoid pyramiding the use and sales tax, the only way to avoid this result was to recognize the contractor's claim to the exemption.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs claimed that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 168.472 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6.1472 (1956 Rev)) was an unconstitutional restriction of the right of initiative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought to initiate legislation by filing a referendum petition with the Secretary of State to contest a Michigan statute that exempted the state from Daylight Saving Time. The Secretary refused to accept the petitions because a statute required that petitions to initiate legislation needed to be filed with the Secretary of State not less than 10 days before the beginning of a session of the legislature.The filing violated the deadline. Plaintiffs commenced an action seeking a writ of mandamus. The court found that the statute prevented a statutory initiative proposal from appearing on the ballot within a period of time less than 10 months after it was submitted to the legislature. By restricting access to the legislature, the statute limited access to the statutory initiative process. The court ruled that this restriction conflicted with the express 40-day limitation contained in the Michigan Constitution. The court concluded that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 168.472 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6.1472 (1956 Rev)) constituted an unnecessary and, therefore, unreasonable restraint on the constitutional right of the people to initiative. The statute was, thus, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

They asserted that 1954 Mich. Pub. Acts 166, &sect; 11(b) was unconstitutional because the legislature had exhausted its authority to define residence in &sect; 11(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the City Clerk denied the students permission to register to vote in Ann Arbor, they brought an action for mandamus. The trial court rendered judgment for the City Clerk against certain students, finding that 1954 Mich. Pub. Acts 166, &sect; 11(b) was constitutional in defining residence for voting purposes. The unsuccessful students appealed, urging that &sect; 11(b) was unconstitutional because the legislature had already defined residence in &sect; 11(a). The court disagreed, explaining that it found no constitutional impediment to giving a general definition in &sect; 11(a) and then specifically defining in &sect; 11(b) certain statutory presumptions. Section 11(b) provided that certain categories of electors would not gain or lose a residence by reason of their particular employment, nor while at certain institutions. The result was enfranchisement for some who would not otherwise have been able to establish a voting residence. The students could vote in the city or township where they could show an intention to make it their residence for voting purposes. The students had not been able to do so for Ann Arbor and ample evidence supported these findings.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was returned to prison for a minimum of 18 months and, acting in propria persona, petitioned the court for a writ of superintending control.

Ann. &sect; 28.2310 (repealed 1968)). The court ruled that denying an attorney to an indigent defendant during the same proceeding was a denial of equal protection of the laws. The court found that it was important to provide counsel when the issue was revocation of parole and reincarceration, especially in cases involving a factual dispute as to whether or not there was a violation of parole.

The thrust of the motion was that he pleaded guilty only because there was at the time of the acceptance of his plea, in the possession of the police and prosecuting attorney, inculpatory statements which he believed would have incontestably established guilt. Defendant contended these statements were obtained in violation of his constitutional rights. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the motion, holding that, where the trial judge examined the accused in painstaking detail as to the reason for his plea, explained to him in precise terms all of his pre-plea alternatives, pointed out fully and fairly the consequences of the plea, and where the accused was represented by counsel with whom he conferred before he proffered his plea, the plea, in fact and in law, was made &quot;voluntarily&quot; within that term's meaning in the ordinary use of language.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the first-degree murders of a couple. Defendant appealed the convictions and, upon review, the court reversed. Defendant contended that a detective's examination of a pair of shoes in the defendant's apartment constituted an illegal search in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The court found that the detective saw the shoes during his lawful search for defendant in the apartment and that the detective, believing the shoes were those worn at the murder scene, properly scrutinized the shoes more carefully. The court held that the detective's actions in lifting defendant's shoes and examining their heels did not constitute a search in the constitutional sense and that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. The court also held that photographs of the victims were admissible to show malice with which the crimes were committed. In reversing the convictions, the court held that the admission of other pending double murder charges against defendant for impeachment purposes was error and resulted in overwhelming prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction, after trial by jury in a Wayne county trial court (Michigan), for possession of a blackjack, in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.224 (1962). He argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress the evidence of a blackjack that was seized from his home on the grounds that the search was unreasonable. He also argued the trial court erred by denying his motion for a continuance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that police officers and federal agents went to defendant's home with a valid warrant to arrest him for conspiracy to commit extortion. An officer told defendant to get dressed because he was wearing pajamas. Before defendant opened a dresser in his bedroom, an officer searched it and found the blackjack. The officers then searched defendant's bedroom and his entire house. On appeal, the court held that although the fact that the officers searched defendant's entire house tended to becloud the lawfulness of the search of the dresser as incident to a lawful arrest, the record showed that the officers acted in good faith and that defendant's arrest was the primary purpose. The court determined that defendant's arrest was not a mere subterfuge to search his home. Thus, the court concluded, the search was reasonably incident to and contemporaneous with defendant's arrest and as such, the blackjack was lawfully admitted. The court also ruled that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a continuance because he failed to show that he was prejudiced by the absence of his preferred attorney from the firm representing him; substitute counsel was effective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and cancelled defendant's bond.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Barry County Board of Supervisors filed three apportionment plans with the county clerk over the course of one year. Plan no. 3 applied at the 1968 primary election of Barry County commissioners where the candidate was successful. He was later defeated in the general election. The candidate filed a complaint in quo warranto attacking the validity of the election on the ground that plan no. 1 was the only valid apportionment plan. The trial court agreed and held that elections were conducted under a plan adopted without legal authority. Regardless, the trial court refused to disturb the results. On appeal, the court reversed and held that plan no. 3 should apply to the 1970 election of commissioners in Barry County. The court declined, however, to review the constitutionality of the three plans because the 1970 census was being conducted, and within a few months the Apportionment Commission of Barry County was going to be required to draft a new plan with the 1970 census figures. If the court declared that the three plans were unconstitutional, the Commission would have been required to draft a new plan on the basis of the 1960 census figures.</SPAN></P>

The elector asserted that the plan failed to meet the requirements of 1966 Mich. Pub. Acts 261, &sect; 4(a) and violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission adopted a new plan apportioning county commissioners, which called for a board of 15 members to be elected from 15 separate districts within the county. The average population of a perfect district was 9,996. The largest district had a population of 11,072 or 10.8% under-represented. The smallest district had a population of 8,660 or 13.4% over-represented. The ratio of population between the largest and the smallest districts was 1:1.28. The elector petitioned the court to review the plan, urging that it violated &sect; 4(a) and was unconstitutional. The court agreed, explaining that the plan failed to satisfy &sect; 4(a) or to meet the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Commission's attempts to obtain compact square-shaped districts, avoid gerrymandering, avoid the splitting of precincts, and avoid the division of political subdivisions did not justify the population variances. In ordering the Commission to reapportion the commissioners, the court noted that a plan with a variance ratio exceeding 1:1.10 would be of doubtful constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the apportionment plan and remanded it to the Commission to reapportion commissioners and further ordered the Commission to submit the revised plan to the court for review.</SPAN></P>

According to defendant, the result was the unconstitutional, systematic exclusion of blacks from the jury. On appeal, the court held that defendant was not entitled to a new trial because the trial court did not err by denying defendant's challenge to the jury. The court found that defendant's argument neglected the fact that the petit jury panel was drawn from the larger list, and there was no showing that the larger list was selected contrary to law or that it did not reflect the county's population distribution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and four or five others were observed gathering at a street corner, where they conducted themselves in a loud and noisy manner.

Based on the actions and statements made by defendant, he was charged with and convicted of undertaking to incite a riot. The court held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.505 was not unconstitutionally vague. Further, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.521 did not apply to the offense of inciting to riot and did not preclude the prosecution of defendant under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.505. Also, there was a clear and present danger of a riot caused by defendant's yelling and screaming to &quot;burn&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; and take over a municipality. It occurred approximately 12 hours after the city had erupted in a full-scale riot. The trial court found that defendant's yelling and screaming had helped cause a crowd to grow, and testimony was received that some persons began to advance on the police.

The homeowners argued that the county owned the airport and that it was not immune from liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The federal government deeded land to the county, and an airport was built using federal funds. The federal government had a non-exclusive right to use the airport, and the county derived revenue from commercial use of the airport. The homeowners instituted an action against the county to recover money damages for an alleged taking of aviation easements. The homeowners claimed inverse condemnation of their property because of the unbearable noise and general disruption of its use and enjoyment. The trial court entered judgment for the county, and the homeowners appealed. The court reversed, holding that, assuming the homeowners could prove an unconstitutional taking of their property, they would be entitled to recover from the county for such damages as they could prove at trial. The county was the owner of the airport, and, as such, it owed a duty to the homeowners. The county received benefits from its ownership of the airport, and it could not hide under the umbrella of immunity or escape its responsibilities by pointing a finger at the federal government. Therefore, if the homeowners could prove damages at trial, the county should be held liable for the awarded damages.</SPAN></P>

In reversing the trial court's judgment, the court although there is no specific language authorizing road commissions to bargain collectively with their employees, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 224.10(a) (1969 Cum. Supp.) indicated that the legislature so intended. There exists no single agency in the county, which has the exclusive right or responsibility to represent the county in all matters pertinent to the process of collective bargaining.</SPAN></P>

The attorney general asserted that the trial court erred because the land was subject to 1965 Mich. Pub. Acts 291 and was open to the public for recreation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The riparian owners' property surrounded a lake whose only access was by means of a road across their properties. The riparian owners initiated an action against certain state officials and others seeking to enjoin them from walking over the riparian owners' land to gain access to the lake. The attorney general intervened asserting that when the riparian owners spread fill-dirt partly in the water and partly on the land without a permit, they violated 1965 Mich. Pub. Acts 291 (act). The trial court found that the disputed road was private and granted the injunction, and the attorney general appealed asserting that the lake was &quot;navigable&quot; for purposes of public recreation and subject to the permitting provisions of the act. The court affirmed holding that, as the lake was not suited for any valuable boat or vessel navigation, it was not subject to the provisions of the act. It further held that the public could not use the lake for recreation. It was a 74-acre lake lacking inlets or outlets, was non-navigable, private, and subject to the exclusive use and possession of its riparian owners. Thus, the trial court correctly enjoined the use of the lake's waters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order granting the injunction restraining state officials and members of the public from using the waters of a private lake that was subject to the riparian owners' exclusive use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured party filed a complaint against defendant city. He alleged that while he was sitting on his porch during a time of civil disturbance he was shot in the head by one of many law enforcement officers in the area and suffered severe and permanent injuries and paralysis. The injured party challenged the decision of the Saginaw trial court (Michigan), which granted defendant city summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party alleged that during the disturbance, the city requested assistance from the state police and armed auxiliary police and that he was shot that same evening by a law enforcement officer. The city filed no affidavits controverting the facts stated in the injured party's complaint. The city filed a motion for accelerated judgment on the basis that the city was immune from tort liability. That position was based on 1964 Mich. Pub. Acts 170, &sect; 7, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1407. The trial court granted the city summary judgment. On appeal, the court noted that subsequent to the filing of the parties briefs, it had, in another case, found the statute at issue to be unconstitutionally broad. As to the common-law principles upon which the city relied, the court stated that not only were those principles not raised before the circuit judge, and thus not properly before the court, the city's arguments misconstrued the injured party's allegations, the purpose of a summary judgment motion, and the concept of discretion. For those reasons the court did not consider them. The court held that the issues of fact raised in the pleadings required determination on the merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting summary judgment in favor of the city was set aside, and the cause was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed a writ of habeas corpus with the court, claiming that he was being illegally detained because he was not receiving proper treatment. He had been found to be a criminal sexual psychopath under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 780.504 (Supp. 1961) and was committed to a state mental hospital as the result of a hearing under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 780.505 (Supp. 1961). The court granted an order to show cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner did not claim to be cured of his disorder, but he claimed that he was not being given treatment at the hospital. He argued that he was being illegally detained and should be released so that he could seek treatment elsewhere. The People asserted that petitioner was uncooperative and failed to respond to treatment. The court held that it was not the proper forum for determination of the disputed facts. Under Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 712.1(2) (1963), the court noted that such determination was to be made by the circuit court in the county wherein petitioner was detained. Although 1939 Mich. Pub. Acts 165, the so-called criminal sexual psychopath act, had been repealed by 1968 Mich. Pub. Acts 143, the court held that the civil nature of the commitment and detention of persons such as petitioner remained unchanged. Therefore, if petitioner was in fact not receiving treatment, his incarceration would be an unconstitutional deprivation of liberty. Even though the hospital was an appropriate state institution within the meaning of the statute under which petitioner was committed, the court held that that did not diminish the State's obligation to give him proper care and treatment.</SPAN></P>

The nominee applied for a writ of mandamus to compel the county clerk to certify her as the candidate that received the most votes. The lower court denied the nominee's request, holding that the requirements of 1968 Mich. Pub. Acts 168 did not offend either the state of federal constitutions. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that the legislature had the power to require the nominee for precinct delegate to receive a minimum number of votes in order to be elected. That did not destroy the votes of the electors. Rather, the mandatory minimum merely regulated the franchise in a manner that was reasonable and gave full, equal effect to the votes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his second trial, defendant appealed a decision of the Recorder's Court of Detroit (Michigan), which reduced a jury's verdict from a finding of guilty of rape to a verdict of guilty of the lesser included offense of assault with intent to commit rape, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.85. In a previous trial for rape, defendant had been convicted of assault with intent to commit rape and was then granted a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his first trial, defendant was tried for rape, but was convicted of the lesser included offense of assault with intent to rape. Defendant was then granted a new trial. At the second trial, the jury returned a verdict convicting him of rape. At sentencing, the trial court held that it was improper for defendant to have been convicted of rape, on the grounds that the conviction at the first trial of the lesser included offense acted as an acquittal of the rape charge, thus making a conviction for rape double jeopardy. The trial court changed the verdict to a conviction for assault with intent to rape. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial. The court held that it was error for defendant to have been tried for rape in the second trial pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 768.33 and the state and federal constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy. The court concluded that the issue of whether it was proper to have reduced the verdict to cure the error was governed by federal double jeopardy and constitutional standards.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The architect brought a quo warranto action against the Registration Board, seeking to have the Registration Board declared unconstitutional. The architect claimed the Registration Board was unconstitutionally composed because only three of its seven members were architects and Mich.

The Registration Board contended that quo warranto was an inappropriate procedural vehicle. The court held that quo warranto was an appropriate vehicle by which to maintain the architect's action, that Mich. Comp.

Section 338.553a (1969), by which architects, professional engineers, and land surveyors were deemed to be members of one profession, was an attempt to evade the purpose of Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hearing, at which the agency was present and expressed opposition, rules were adopted governing the operations of private security agencies. The agency sought to enjoin the enforcement of these rules. The trial court granted the police department's motion for dismissal. The agency appealed. The court reversed and remanded. The court rejected the department's allegations that the agency had failed to exhaust certain administrative remedies and noted that a party was not required to exhaust such remedies where a party would be acting in vain. In the case at issue, the police department made clear its intent to enforce the rules, so any administrative measures undertaken by the agency would be a waste of time. The court found that declaratory relief was appropriate as an actual controversy existed as to the constitutionality of the administrative provision. The court held that the provision of the new rules requiring a standardized shape of employee badges was beyond the rule-making authority of the police department and enjoined enforcement of that rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the course of the trial, defendant admitted on direct examination facts constituting all the elements of the crime of carrying a dangerous weapon in a motor vehicle. The charge fully disputed was that of assault with intent to commit murder. In the charge to the jury, the trial judge twice listed the lesser included offenses for assault with intent to murder and defined the term &quot;assault&quot; three times. In repeating these items, the trial court once omitted felonious assault from the list of lesser-included offenses and once erroneously defined assault. No objections were raised at trial. Defendant argued that the jury's verdict was not a finding of guilty for the crime of carrying a dangerous weapon in a motor vehicle because there was no such crime as &quot;illegal possession of a firearm.&quot; On appeal, the court held that the two errors in the charge to the jury were correctly covered in the course of the instruction and no objection was raised below. The court held that &quot;illegal possession of a firearm&quot; had no legal meaning within the context of a verdict. Therefore, the verdict was void. Where the verdict was void, the court held the prosecution was entitled to a valid verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of felonious assault. The court reversed defendant's conviction of illegal possession of a firearm and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation passed a resolution that imposed a sewage tap charge on subsequently built structures, but exempted existing structures from the charge. The Michigan Supreme Court held that the resolution was unconstitutional. The builders filed an action in the trial court seeking damages for fees paid by them under the resolution; the trial court granted their motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that the builders were entitled to reimbursement for the fees paid. The court found that a subsequent resolution passed by the city, which retroactively imposed sewage tap charges on structures that were exempted under the first resolution did not satisfy the corporation's obligation because the first resolution was invalid and never imposed an enforceable charge, and because the corporation would otherwise keep money gained in violation of constitutional principles. The court concluded that the corporation was required to pay the total amount due to the builders into the court, rather than paying only those funds for which individual claims were filed within six months after notice was given by publication and registered letter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Secretary of State appealed from reinstatement of plaintiff accused's driving privileges from the Washtenaw County Circuit Court (Michigan), claiming that it erred in finding that a police officer might not choose the particular chemical test administered and that a person arrested for driving under the influence could refuse a breath test without loss of his license where he requested a blood test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accused was arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. He was advised of his rights and offered a breath test. The accused telephoned his attorney and was advised to take a blood test, but the officer refused to arrange for it. Thus, his driver's license was suspended for 90 days. Following issuance of an order staying the suspension, the trial court held a hearing on procedural inadequacies as to the chemical tests. It set aside the suspension and ordered the return of his operator's license. The secretary of state appealed. The court held that return of the license was error. The accused was offered a breath test, and because he refused it, his license was subject to suspension or revocation. As this was a civil case, denial of the accused's right to obtain a blood sample because he had refused to take a breath test did not prohibit suspension of his license. Therefore, he was properly subject to suspension or revocation of his license. In reversing, the court held that the trial court erred in setting aside the order of suspension.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant objected to the introduction into evidence of a loaded handgun found on him when he was arrested two days after the robbery. The court stated that although the evidence did not establish that the gun found on defendant was the gun used in committing the crime, weapons or tools that might have been used to commit the crime found in the accused's possession at the time of arrest could be introduced without proof that they were the very weapons or tools in fact so used. Next, the court held that the trial court erred in not giving defendant specific credit against his sentence for the time he served in jail between the time of his arrest and the time of his sentencing, as required by Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 769.11b. The sentence credit statute was remedial and had been liberally construed so as to effectuate its purpose. Accordingly, the fact that defendant received credit against old sentences that he had not fully served did not negate his right to credit against the present armed robbery sentence. To allow the credit against the old sentences and not the new would, in light of the concurrency of the sentences, only confer an illusory benefit.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 117.4f. DSR cross-appealed the denial of a refund for the taxes paid prior to the effective date of &sect; 117.4f.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DSR paid both local and county taxes on its property outside of the city's limits. However, when Mich. Comp.

It filed a complaint against the county seeking a refund of taxes it paid or assessed after &sect; 117.4f was adopted, but before its effective date. The trial court entered judgment for DSR and ordered a refund only of the taxes paid after the effective date of the statute. Both parties appealed. The court modified the award, ordering that interest be included on the refund to DSR, but, as modified, affirmed. The court held that the legislature did not intend to require counties to repay municipal transportation utilities any portion of the taxes paid before the statute became effective, but it did intend to relieve the utilities from liability to pay taxes thereafter, even if the taxes were assessed prior to the statute's effective date. The court held that anything related to the ownership of a public transportation utility was properly included in the home rule act and did not go beyond the act's entitlement, so did not violate Mich.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents of elementary and secondary school children appealed a judgment of the trial court (Michigan), which held that the purchase of textbooks and miscellaneous school supplies by the parents did not violate the guarantee of Ohio Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2, to a free public education and refused to order the refund of school activity fees by defendant Ann Arbor School District received from the students.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents filed a class action under Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 208.1(3) (1963) alleging that the imposition of fees for school activities and the expenses incurred in the purchase of books and school supplies was a violation of their children's right to a free education under Mich. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2 (1963). The trial court granted an injunction against the imposition of the fees, but refused to order a refund. It also held that the parents' purchase of books and supplies did not violate Mich. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the school system permitted all children residing in the district to attend classes and receive instruction in the subjects taught, without a tuition charge. It therefore provided free schools. The fact that the parents of pupils financially able to do so were required to provide textbooks and other supplies did not change the character of the school. The court held that the fees already collected were expended for the education of the children in school at that time and to require a refund from the current school budget would work a hardship on the current students who deserved to have those funds expended for their education.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was parked in front of the Redford Township police headquarters while he awaited a police interrogation of his two nephews on an unrelated crime. The Redford police discovered that defendant had several outstanding traffic warrants in Detroit. Defendant was placed under arrest to be held for the Detroit police. The Redford police conducted an inventory of his car and produced two marijuana cigarettes and seeds. Defendant's motion to quash the information and to suppress the evidence was denied. He waived his right to a jury trial and was found guilty. On appeal, defendant contended that the People's failure to produce res gestae witnesses was reversible error. The court agreed, finding that the People did not make a diligent effort to insure the presence of the witnesses because all of the police officers who had incriminating evidence against defendant were indorsed on the original complaint, but the res gestae witnesses were not indorsed until defendant moved for indorsement. The record showed that the People made no attempt to question defendant's nephews about the marijuana, nor did they make any effort to find them for over a year and a half after defendant's arrest.</SPAN></P>

The regents then commenced an action against the board. They sought a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional. The unions intervened in that matter as a defendant. The trial court found that the Act was constitutional and that it did apply to the regents. The regents appealed from that judgment, which was affirmed. The Act granted public employees certain benefits of collective bargaining and organization and was authorized by Mich. Const. art. IV, &sect; 48. The court stated that the regents were a public employer. However, Mich. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 6 provided that the regents had general supervision over the university and control of its expenditures. The court noted that the regents were subject to the general laws of Michigan notwithstanding that constitutional provision. Therefore, the nonacademic employees were entitled to the benefits provided by the Act.</SPAN></P>

The board of control filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not a public employer within the meaning of Mich. Pub.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">City officials attended a movie at defendant's theater. Thereafter a meeting was held that the prosecutor's office and members of the vice squad were sent to see the movie. They went to the projection booth, arrested the projectionist, and seized the film. A complaint and warrant were served on defendant. Defendant was convicted of showing an obscene movie. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the officers had sufficient information with which to judge the movie obscene. Therefore, the arrest of the projectionist and seizure of the film itself was reasonable and lawful. The court held that although the movie, which dealt with the problems of an over-sexed young woman, had a pseudo-psychoanalytical approach it was obscene because its dominant theme appealed to the prurient interest in sex. It was patently offensive because it went beyond contemporary community standards relating to the representation of sexual matters, and it was without redeeming social value. The court considered the conditions under which the content of the movie was conveyed in reaching its decision. If the same acts and occurrences had been described in the written word, they would not have been obscene.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's decision. First, the trial judge acted in his discretion in giving full and controlling credence to one of several expert witness where no cases were cited to the contrary. Second, there was ample evidence to support the trial court's holding that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was unreasonable when applied to one portion of the property but valid as to another portion. The zoning failed to give any reasonable consideration to the character or future of the area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party lost his eye due to an explosion at the city dump. He brought an action against the city for nuisance and negligence, but voluntarily struck his allegations of negligence. The lower court found in favor of the injured party. The city appealed the finding of liability and the injured party appealed the verdict amount. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the injured party's nuisance suit was well founded, and that the nuisance arose out of the negligent operation of the dump. The court also held that recovery was not barred by the governmental immunity provision under 1964 Mich. Pub. Acts 170, &sect; 7. The court found that &sect; 7 violated Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 24, because it embraced the object of tort liability that was not expressed in its title, which was limited to negligence. The court determined that it would be a strained construction to read the word negligence into the immunity provision. The court also held that the lower court properly denied the injured party's motion for a new trial and additur.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to assault with intent to commit murder in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.83 (1948) and was sentenced to prison for a term of 19 to 40 years. His plea was subsequently set aside and his sentence vacated, and upon the return of a jury verdict of guilty as charged, defendant was sentenced to a term of 25 to 50 years. He appealed, contending that it was reversible error for the judge, who was not the judge who sentenced defendant originally, to impose a more severe sentence than the original judge. The court affirmed the order. The trial afforded more opportunity to hear all details, and to observe and judge defendant than did a summary plea proceeding. Moreover, the trial judge explained that the sentence he was about to impose was not because defendant had appealed, but by reason of the nature of the crime and impressions formed of defendant during three days of trial. The trial judge noted that the statute under which defendant was convicted authorized a life sentence or any term of years, and except for defendant's past history, poor family background, good school, service and prison records, a life sentence would have been imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State of Michigan appealed a decision from the Wayne County Circuit Court (Michigan), which held that 1923 Mich. Pub. Acts 151 was unconstitutional and overruled the probate court's order that approved the State's claim against defendant estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's son was adjudicated insane and committed to a state hospital. The son was to be a full pay patient, and his estate and the decedent were held responsible for 100 percent of the cost of the son's maintenance. The decedent failed to make the payments as ordered by the probate court. The decedent died and the State filed a claim against his estate for the unpaid balance. The claim was approved by the probate court, but it was subsequently denied by the circuit court. The State argued that Act 151 did not violate Mich. Const. art. 11, &sect; 15 (1908). The court found that the reimbursement provision properly allocated the burden to all taxpayers and did not result in a double taxation. Further, the classification contained within 1923 Mich. Pub. Acts 151 was a proper one and bore a reasonable relationship to the purpose of the statute. The court based this determination on three factors, causation, benefit, and moral duty, which it found to be relevant, sufficient, and reasonable to satisfy the constitutional requirement. Finally, the order for the 100 percent contribution was not conclusive or res judicata as to conditions, which changed subsequent thereto.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded to the probate court for a hearing on the decedent's petition to modify the probate court's support order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sale of narcotics under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 335.152 (1957). Subsequently, his motion for a new trial was granted on the condition that he plead guilty to unlawful possession of narcotics under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 335.153 (1957). Defendant pled guilty and was sentenced under a &quot;first offense&quot; provision. On appeal, defendant alleged that the &quot;first offense&quot; penalty provision of &sect; 335.153 violated due process and equal protection and that the grant of a new trial was an inducement to plead guilty; the State moved to affirm. The court rejected defendant's constitutional argument; the court's examination of the record showed that the guilty plea was accepted in accordance with Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 785.3 (1963). Further, the grant of a new trial on condition that defendant plead guilty to a lesser offense, where the original conviction was final and there was no valid ground for granting a new trial other than defendant's and the trial court's desire to avoid a mandatory minimum sentence for the original offense, was no more objectionable than acceptance of a guilty plea to a lesser-included offense. Thus, the court granted the motion to affirm conviction.</SPAN></P>

The individuals appealed, contending that the notice requirement violated their constitutional rights to equal protection and due process of law. The court affirmed the order, holding that it was entirely competent for the legislature to enact a general statute of limitations that would put adults and minors on the same footing with reference to the time in which actions must be brought, and such would be the legal effect of a statute which contained no saving clause exempting infants from its operations. Section 691.1404 was a reasonable and rational exercise of the legislature's power and consequently did not contain any of the constitutional objections asserted by the individuals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant refused to answer the questions of a one-man grand juror, he was charged with criminal contempt under Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.945 (1954). Defendant conditionally waived a trial by jury if it was determined that the contempt, if any, was in fact criminal and not civil. The trial court dismissed the charges against defendant. The State contended on appeal that the trial court erred in dismissing the charges because a prosecution for criminal contempt after expiration of the grand jury term was proper under the grand jury contempt statute. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case. The court concluded that expiration of the grand jury term was not a bar to a prosecution for criminal contempt for contumacious conduct that occurred during the grand jury inquiry. The court determined that the purge proviso of the grand jury contempt statute was unconstitutional insofar as it related to criminal contempt because it infringed upon the exclusive pardon and commutation power of the governor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed suit against the state board of education to challenge the constitutionality of 1967 Mich. Pub.

The Act involved the emergency reorganization of primary and fourth class school districts that did not maintain high schools lying wholly in, or the major part of the territory of which lay wholly in, a county of more than 1,000,000 population. As amended by 1968 Mich. Pub. Acts 130, &sect; 2, the Act was made effective without limit. Plaintiffs alleged that 1967 Mich. Pub. Acts 239 applied only to Wayne County and, therefore, was a local and special act in violation of Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 29 (1963) because a general act could have been made applicable. The trial court granted summary judgment to the Board. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court stated that 1967 Mich. Pub.

The court noted that the ordinance did not contain an express requirement of scienter, and the complaint against defendant did not recognize scienter as an element in charging the offense. The court also noted that an anti-obscenity ordinance could be found unconstitutional due to its failure to require scienter as an element of the offense. The court concluded that the anti-obscenity ordinance in question was similarly unconstitutional for its failure to require scienter as an element of the offense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner appealed from a judgment that permanently enjoined the owner from the further sale, distribution, and acquisition or possession for sale of certain allegedly obscene booklets or magazines. The owner contended that the judge erred in determining the material was obscene. The court adopted and followed the Roth test which required that it had to be established that the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appealed to a prurient interest in sex; the material was patently offensive because it affronted contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; and the material was utterly without redeeming social value. The material was found to have met all of the factors of the Roth test and in addition, the owner was liable for pandering. The court balanced the rights of freedom of speech and press with the right to be sheltered against the exploitation of obscene publications for profit. After reviewing the material, the court found the publications were obscene and not protected under the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Evidence was introduced, and defendant stipulated that he was on a public sidewalk and that he impeded the passage of pedestrians. The appellate court affirmed the conviction and determined that the evidence was sufficient to support it. The court further found no merit in the contention that the ordinance was unconstitutional, vague, and overbroad because it did not prohibit standing on a sidewalk, but only standing on a sidewalk so as to hinder or impede pedestrian traffic, and therefore the ordinance achieved its obvious regulatory purpose of keeping sidewalks clear.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the ordinance was not void on its face or unconstitutionally vague or uncertain when it was applied to the facts of the case.

The pedestrian also alleged errors in voir dire, that he should have been read his constitutional rights before being questioned in the hospital, and that the some jurors did not give a proper oath. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment. The court stated that &sect; 731 was not unconstitutional because it discriminated in a like manner persons in the class of parties involved in accidents with motorists and it did not specifically discriminate against pedestrians, plaintiffs, motorists, or defendants. The court rejected the pedestrian's voir dire objections because the trial judge correctly suppressed voir dire examination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A special assessment district was established to fix and maintain the water level of the lake bordering the landowners' property. The front footage assessment base was adjusted downward by the drain commissioner from 2,100' to 900' as the assessment base. As a result of a petition by the landowners, the probate court appointed a board of review, which revised the special assessment to a reduced sum. The circuit court affirmed the assessment, considering it to be both equitable and reasonable. On appeal, the landowners argued that the proposed raising and fixing of the level of the lake would confer no assessable benefit on their property, and since there was no benefit the assessment would be improper as a taking of private property for public use without compensation. The court affirmed. A stabilizing of the lake level was of some mutual benefit to all abutting property owners. There was insufficient evidence to negate the conclusion that an equitable benefit reflected by the reduced assessment was derived by the landowners to their property due to the increase and stabilization of the lake water level.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit judges requested that the county make provision in its next budget year for additional probation officers, law clerks, and a judicial assistant. They were unable to reach a compromise with the board of supervisors, so they brought an action to compel defendants to provide the funds. The trial court issued a writ of mandamus directing defendants to provide the necessary funds, and defendants appealed, arguing that the board of supervisors had the right to determine how the county's money was spent and that the doctrine of separation of powers barred the judges from obtaining the relief granted. The court affirmed, holding that several rules and statutes authorized the judges to hire the probation officers, clerks, and assistants, to fix their compensation, and to require the county to appropriate the funds required to pay their compensation. The court held that the legislative purpose was to vest in the judges, not the board, the power to determine the county's needs and to direct the legislative body to appropriate the funds required to hire them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school district appealed the judgment of the St. Clair Court (Michigan), which ordered summary judgment in favor of defendant bondholder. The school district had filed a complaint for declaratory relief contesting a series of county elections in certain school districts. Three school districts had voted to combine and annex into one. Certain debt of two of the three districts were assumed by the newly created district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district had paid off its debt prior to the annexation and in its cause of action challenged the assumption of the debt of two of the districts by the new unionized district. The school district asserted on appeal that the annexation and bond assumption statute, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 340.431 et seq., was void for uncertainty, offended the Michigan Constitution because it permitted persons other than property owning electors to vote on the assumption of the bonded debt of other districts, and violated equal protection. The court disagreed and found that the school district failed to specify how the statute at issue was uncertain and that the statute did not offend Mich. Const. art. 3, &sect;4 (1908) because that section only applied to elections to increase the constitutional tax limitation or to issue bonds. The court further held that with regard to equal protection, the vote of each elector of the combined district had equal weight and that the school district's argument assumed that the three districts comprising the combined district retained their individual character in the debt assumption election and, therefore, was meritless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that the trial court should have granted summary judgment in favor of the bondholder and held that an order for summary judgment was granted with the court.

Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 206.1 et seq. (Cum. Supp. 1967), was unconstitutional. The trial court (Michigan) granted the treasury department's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the taxpayers' complaint. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers contended that the classification of taxpayers into three categories, individuals, corporations, and financial institutions, violated the equal protection of the laws provisions of the Federal and State Constitutions, the Due Process and Privileges and Immunities Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the new Civil or Political Rights Clause of the Michigan Constitution. In upholding the dismissal of the taxpayers' action, the court held that the classification of taxpayers into three principal categories of individuals, corporations, and financial institutions, did not violate Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 7 or any of the other constitutional provisions claimed by the taxpayers because the classification was not based on their respective incomes, and because the rates of tax imposed by the Act were uniformly applicable to all taxable income of every taxpayer in each class. The court found that there was not so much similarity between individuals, corporations, and financial institutions and the nature of their sources of income that they were required to be classified alike for tax purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court determined that the association had the power to require that unless a freeholder had lived in his property four of the last four weekends, he had no authority to vote. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. It did not reach the issue of constitutional validity. The court noted that the increasing use and development of the resort home and property as a place of escape for the weary urban resident required a re-evaluation of the accepted definition of &quot;residence.&quot; Resort property was a substantial long-term investment for such people, the lot being purchased first with construction to follow at some indeterminate time dependent upon such variables as weather, financial ability, and age. The court noted that the vacant resort lot owners (freeholders) were assessed and the use of their property could have been subject to certain controls. Thus, the court held that the freeholders should reasonably have had some say in the operation of the association. Accordingly, the court determined that to have &quot;resided,&quot; the freeholders must have owned property in the territory to have been affected for four weekends in the month preceding the election.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission actively enforced its residency rule under Detroit, Mich., Civ. Serv. R. VII. After the Commission denied the employees' petition, claiming that rule VII was unauthorized, the employees filed a complaint with the circuit court. The circuit court held that the power to promulgate the residency rule was conferred on the Commission by the City Charter and that the residency rule was constitutional. The court disagreed with the circuit court and concluded that the City Charter did not allocate to the Commission the power to establish a residency requirement as a continuing condition of employment. The court held that rule VII went well beyond the Commission's power to establish a provision related to the examination and selection of employees under Detroit, Mich., City Charter tit. 4, ch. 2, &sect; 7. The court further found that the Commission did not have duties or powers that were not necessary to carry out the provisions of Detroit, Mich., City Charter tit. 4, ch. 2. Because the court based its reversal of the circuit court decision on nonconstitutional issues, it declined to reach the constitutional issues raised by the parties.</SPAN></P>

The property owners claimed that the public utility condemnation statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 486.251 et seq. (1948) (Mich. Stat.

The trial court denied the injunction, and the property owners appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the public utility condemnation statute did not violate the right to a jury trial protected by Mich. Const. art 1, &sect; 14 (1963) because the constitutional clause pertained to the right to a trial by jury as it had become known to the previous jurisprudence of Michigan. Because proceedings to condemn land were special and summary in character, they were not judicial proceedings to which the right to a jury trial attached at common law. Further, the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not guarantee a common law jury trial in condemnation cases. Finally, Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 516.5, which allowed a factual determination by either a jury or commissioners, was applicable to condemnation proceedings in the probate court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded that &sect; 28.613(2) was invalid. In affirming, the court held that the assessment under &sect; 28.613 conflicted with the requirement under Mich. Const. art. 8, &sect; 9 that all fines assessed for the breach of Michigan penal laws be exclusively applied to the support of designated libraries. The court noted that the assessment prescribed by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 28.613 (1948) could not be considered to be &quot;costs.&quot; Rather, the court found that the assessment was a supplemental fine because it operated in effect as a 10 percent surcharge on fines imposed on convicted defendants.

The trial judge permanently enjoined the sale or distribution of the magazines the jury found to be obscene and directed the destruction of those magazines.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, school districts and individual residents, sought review of an order of the Cass County Circuit Court (Michigan), which awarded partial summary judgment to intervenor Attorney General in the plaintiffs' action to have a school district reorganization election declared void and to have the reorganization of school districts act, 1964 Mich. Pub. Acts 289 (Act 289), declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought an action to enjoin defendants from conducting a school district reorganization election pursuant to Act 289, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 388.681 et seq. (1948) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15.2299(1) et seq. (1968)). The trial court denied plaintiffs' motion for temporary injunctive relief, and the election was held as scheduled in accordance with Act 289. The individual plaintiffs were granted leave to proceed in the nature of quo warranto under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.4545 (1961) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.4545 (1962)). The court held that: (1) the private citizens were proper parties to bring a quo warranto action; (2) the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the basis of lack of sufficient special interest on the part of the individual plaintiffs because the quo warranto proceedings were timely and properly commenced; (3) plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted with respect to the alleged unconstitutionality of Act 289; and (4) the trial court properly granted summary judgment. The court found that the issues which the trial court deemed issues of fact were issues of law alleviating the necessity for further trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, decedent's father, sought review from a directed verdict issued by the Genesee County Circuit Court (Michigan) following the decedent's father's proofs and dismissed his negligence claim against defendant driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's father argued that the trial court erroneously directed a verdict because there was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to have concluded that the driver was guilty of gross negligence. The decedent's father also argued that the trial court erroneously applied the standard of gross negligence to his claim for negligent entrustment as to the vehicle owner. The court agreed with the decedent's father and reversed the trial court. The court interpreted the statute to mean that gross negligence was required when a guest passenger alleged that the duty breached was the duty to operate the vehicle safely. However, as to negligent entrustment, the statute did not apply because the negligence was not in the operation of the vehicle but in the duty to exercise care in the entrustment of the vehicle. The court also noted that the evidence was sufficient to have allowed the jury to conclude that the driver had exhibited an affirmatively reckless state of mind with intention to depart from careful driving. The court also noted that the deposition of a party was admissible at trial by an adverse party for any purpose regardless whether that party was available to testify.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's directed verdict and remanded to the trial court for a new trial. The court determined that the decedent's father only had to establish ordinary negligence as to his claim against the vehicle owner for negligent entrustment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision from the Recorder's Court of the City of Detroit (Michigan), which convicted him of contributing to the delinquency of a minor under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.145 (1948) (Mich. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.340 (1962)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of contributing to the delinquency and neglect of a minor for encouraging a 16-year-old girl to leave her home and take up lodging in another city. Defendant appealed, alleging the penal statute was vague and that a prior adjudication of delinquency was a prerequisite to his conviction. The court affirmed the conviction. The court concluded the statute was not too vague or indefinite because it informed defendant of the standard of conduct required of him and apprised him of the charges against him. The court also held that prior adjudication of delinquency by a juvenile court was not a prerequisite to defendant's conviction. Reading all sections of the relevant statute together, it was apparent that it was intended to prevent conduct which would tend to cause delinquency and neglect as well as conduct that had caused delinquency and neglect.</SPAN></P>
