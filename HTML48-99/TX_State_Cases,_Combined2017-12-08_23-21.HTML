</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought declaratory judgment to declare title to real property, injunctive relief and damages arising out of other claims including breach of contract, fraud, and usury. Defendants, various persons holding instruments regarding the property, filed counterclaims and cross-claims against appellant's ex-husband. Before trial, the court dismissed many claims on summary judgment, granted legal title to defendant investment company and a money judgment in favor of defendant noteholder. The jury then returned a verdict against appellant on all remaining claims, except for the fraud claim against appellant's ex-husband. Judgments, including interest and attorney fees, entered for defendants. The appellate court reversed the judgment against appellant for property taxes for the tax foreclosure sale because appellant was no longer responsible. Furthermore, the appellate court reversed judgments on two counterclaims because they either did not support the pleadings or raised a new controversy under the Declaratory Judgment Act. The remaining judgments were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pleaded guilty without a plea bargain to possession of cocaine with intent to deliver. The court found him guilty and assessed his punishment at 23 years of imprisonment. On appeal, appellant contended that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann.  &sect; 481.112(f) (Supp. 1999), under which he was convicted and sentenced, was unconstitutional. He contended that it violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, because the punishment it authorized was grossly disproportionate to the crime and as applied to him was inappropriate, and therefore constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court found that appellant did not preserve this contention for review. Even if he had properly preserved error, his punishment was not cruel or unusual. While the state range of punishment was somewhat higher than that set by the federal statutes for a similar crime, the statute did not necessarily provide an unconstitutional punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In this interlocutory appeal, appellant challenged an order from the 334th District Court, Harris County (Texas) that denied its amended plea to the jurisdiction, arguing that the lawsuit against it was barred by sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A teacher retirement system that formed a title-holding subsidiary corporation, a state agency, loaned money to a partnership as financing for an addition to an existing office tower complex. The appellant title-holding subsidiary corporation subsequently took title to the property by deed rather than instituting foreclosure proceedings. The appellee management company of the building filed suit alleging various causes of action including tort claims, breach of contract claims, and an unconstitutional &quot;taking&quot; claim, due to the transfer. The trial court dismissed the teacher retirement system from the suit, upon its plea to the jurisdiction, on the basis of sovereign immunity. However, the trial court denied appellant's amended plea to the jurisdiction. The court held that the suit could not be maintained because of defendant's status as a governmental unit, and it was impossible to amend the petition to confer jurisdiction upon the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Reversed and remanded; the suit could not be maintained without legislative permission because of defendant's status as a governmental unit; thus it was impossible to amend petition to confer jurisdiction upon the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant plaintiff challenged an order from the 352nd District Court of Tarrant County (Texas), which granted appellee's summary judgment in a wrongful death action after an automobile collision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant collided with car of appellee, who was pregnant. Appellant stipulated that he was negligent, that his negligence proximately caused the collision, and that appellee was not negligent. The next day, appellee delivered her child stillborn. Appellees moved for summary judgment during the trial and the trial court granted it, holding that the wrongful death and survival statutes, as construed by the courts of this state, are unconstitutional and the established case law of Texas inflicts upon appellee father gender discrimination that violates the equal protections provisions of the federal and state constitutions. This court held that, on the facts of this case, the Texas wrongful death and survival action statutes unconstitutionally denied redress and equal protection to a mother and father of a viable fetus capable of living outside the womb when viability is wrongly terminated by another's negligent conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment was affirmed. Entitling the mother to damages for the mental anguish caused by the experience of losing a viable fetus to another's negligence, while at the same time denying the father an equal right to damages for his mental anguish caused by the same event, was unconstitutional gender discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant wrote a check that was returned because the checking account was closed. Defendant was charged with theft by check. She pled nolo contendere, and the court deferred adjudication on the condition that she pay all fines and costs within two years. After missing payments, defendant was arrested on a writ of capias. Before her probationary term expired, the court extended probation for two years for failure to make restitution. Defendant requested an attorney be appointed to assist her in an appeal. The court issued a show cause order, questioning whether the order modifying the terms and conditions of probation was a matter over which it had appellate jurisdiction. Defendant responded by requesting the court to treat this matter as a habeas appeal. The court dismissed, having no jurisdiction because the trial court did not have an opportunity to consider the issue in a proper habeas proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was a clerk at Star Video, a large warehouse that sold and rented adult videotapes. On two separate days, undercover Dallas police officers entered the store and purchased videotapes from appellant. Separate juries convicted appellant of two misdemeanor obscenity charges and assessed punishment. Appellant asserted insufficient evidence to establish that he knew that the videotapes were obscene. However, the state was only required to prove that appellant knew the content and character of the videotapes. Appellant further argued that the statute had no scienter requirement. However, the court disagreed because the obscenity statute requires the state to prove appellant &quot;knew&quot; the content of the videotapes. The court found no abuse of discretion in excluding evidence of another clerk's acquittal for selling the same videotape because proof of prior acquittals in obscenity cases is not admissible in subsequent cases on the issue of community standards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged his conviction for failure to register as a sex offender as required under Tex. Crim. P. Code Ann. &sect; 62.02(a) (Supp. 1999) (statute). The court found that applying the statute to appellant's conduct, complaint that he could not reasonably believe he was required to register as a sex offender in second town was without merit. Appellant lived in second apartment for up to 16 days per month. He signed the lease as an &quot;occupant&quot; and as a &quot;resident.&quot; Appellant had fair warning that his living in second town for that amount of time qualified as residing in the municipality for more than seven days under the statute. Thus, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to appellant. Further, appellant could not demonstrate the statute was vague in all of its applications. The trial court's verdict was not against the great weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Affirmed because sex offender registration statute was not unconstitutionally vague; appellant had fair warning that his living in town up to 16 days per month qualified as residing in municipality for more than seven days under statute; further, statute was not vague in all applications; verdict not against weight of evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that since appellant participated in the act giving rise to the forfeiture, he could not be an innocent owner. Furthermore, appellant never affirmatively asserted that he had no knowledge of his wife's criminal activities. Appellant's contention that the warrant was not valid was unsupported by the record.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court dismissed, with prejudice, a medical malpractice suit brought by appellant, an individual, against appellees, including several medical centers and physicians. Appellant brought three issues on appeal: 1) Was it proper to dismiss the lawsuit for failure to timely file a cost bond? 2) Was it proper to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice for a technical flaw in the cost-bond? 3) Does dismissal violate either the Texas Constitution or the Federal Constitution? Finding the trial court acted properly, this court affirmed. The court found that the legislature imposed the cost-bond requirement under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann.  art. 4590i, &sect; 13.01 to limit insurance costs and health care costs, to reduce frivolous malpractice claims, and to allow a physician to recoup costs arising from a successful defense. The statute was not unconstitutional, because it was a reasonable means to achieve these purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was a certified public accountant licensed by the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy (Board). The office of administrative hearings scheduled a hearing to address allegations that appellant had violated well-established professional standards with respect to audits he had performed. Appellant had three months notice of the hearing. At the end of the hearing the Board revoked appellant's license and denied a motion for rehearing. Appellant filed suit, seeking judicial review of the Board's action. The trial court affirmed the Board's action. Appellant claimed that the Board unconstitutionally delegated its powers to the American Institute of Public Accountants and denied him procedural due process in the hearing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the prior action in the lower court, appellant successfully sued to set aside unemployment benefits awarded appellee, a former employee. Appellant sued appellee again on two grounds for recovery, in tort for abuse of the civil process and to declare Tex. Labor Code &sect; 207.007, which barred such recovery, unconstitutional. Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming inter alia, that appellant did not state a claim on which the court could grant relief. The motion, and the appellant's response thereto, did not address the constitutional argument. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint entirely. On appeal, the court held that the lower court granted more relief than was requested, so the matter was reversed in part and remanded for consideration of the constitutional challenge. However, appellant could not circumvent &sect; 207.007 under a new tort theory, so that aspect of the summary judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant appealed decision by County Court at Law No. 7. Of Travis County, (Texas), which overruled his motion to suppress evidence and special plea of former jeopardy, and found him guilty of driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appellant took and failed a breath test following his arrest for driving while intoxicated. Accordingly, the Department of Public Safety suspended his driver's license pursuant to Tex. Transp. Code Ann.  &sect; 524.012 (West 1999). Defendant appealed the suspension. At the ensuing hearing, the administrative law judge found that the arresting officer did not have probable cause to arrest appellant and ordered the reinstatement of his license. Appellant contended the State was collaterally estopped from relitigating the probable cause issue at his subsequent trial for driving while intoxicated, and therefore the county court at law should have sustained both his motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the arrest and his special plea of former jeopardy. The appellate court concluded that an appellant could not invoke the common law collateral estoppel doctrine because the legislature had declared it inapplicable to a criminal prosecution following an administrative license suspension proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Conviction affirmed; prosecution for driving while intoxicated following an administrative driver's license suspension proceeding did not constitute a &quot;successive criminal prosecution&quot; or carry the possibility of &quot;multiple criminal punishments,&quot; and therefore did not implicate the Fifth Amendment double jeopardy guarantee.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting a directed verdict on the basis that the only offered expert witness was not a qualified expert witness.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child was removed from his parents' care when he was 19 months old and the parent-child relationship was terminated thirteen months later. Though the evidence of mother's drug addiction and her ability to parent was legally sufficient to find that termination was in the best interest of the child, after the court weighed the totality of the evidence, it concluded that termination was not in the best interest of the child. The court held that termination was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence and was clearly unjust in light of the uncontroverted evidence of the progress mother had made while in jail. Mindful that a strong presumption that the best interest of the child was served by keeping custody in the natural parent, a &quot;firm belief or conviction&quot; that the best interest of the child required termination of mother's parental rights could not be fairly reached.</SPAN></P>

Although the record did not show that the husband filed an answer seeking permanent injunctive relief, it did contain his application for a temporary injunction. After a hearing, the trial court denied the application via two orders. There was nothing in the clerk's record indicating why the court held as it did. The husband appealed; however, absent from the record was the reporter's record transcribing the proceedings at which his request for injunctive relief was considered, because the husband expressly stated that he would not request a record. On appeal, the court held that an injunction requires the presentation of evidence. Thus, the absence of a reporter's record was dispositive, because the court did not know what evidence was presented to the trial court nor was the court able to assess whether the husband satisfied the prerequisites to obtaining the requested relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Appellant appealed, arguing the trial court erred in denying a new trial on double jeopardy grounds, and his conviction under general aggravated assault and specific intoxication assault statutes violated his right to due course of law under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 and due process under U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV, since both proscribed same conduct. The court vacated appellant's general conviction, holding specific intoxication assault statute prevailed over general statute; and affirmed his specific intoxication assault conviction because imposing convictions for both offenses involving same victim violated due process and due course of law, even when sentences were concurrent.</SPAN></P>

They filed motions to dismiss alleging if they complied with the reporting statutes, they might have subjected themselves to criminal penalties in violation of their constitutional rights against self-incrimination. The trial court agreed and dismissed the prosecutions. The State appealed.

Specifically, the court held that evidence convicting appellant was legally sufficient where a special agent and an undercover officer testified appellant entered a store and obtained cash using an electronic benefit transfer card as prohibited by Tex. Hum. Res. Code Ann.  &sect; 33.011. Further, the court held that there was no evidence in the record to hold that trial counsel was ineffective for not filing a motion to quash the indictment. Finally, the court held that although it might have been error for the charge to combine offenses from both &sect;&sect; 33.011(a) and (b), both offenses were valid violations of the code, and a finding of guilt pursuant to either section would have been proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was found guilty by a jury of sexual assault of a child. As appellant had previously been convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child, he received an automatic life sentence pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 12.42(c)(2). On appeal, he claimed that the sentencing scheme set out in &sect; 12.42(c)(2) was unconstitutional because it violated his right to due process by arbitrarily mandating a sentence of life imprisonment. The court affirmed. Appellant had no constitutional guarantee to a trial by jury on the issue of punishment. The punishment scheme mandated by the legislature was supported by a rational and sufficient interest in removing habitual sexual predators of children from society.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Criminal appellant was charged with two counts of sexual assault. Both counts alleged assault on his 13-year old stepdaughter. The stepdaughter testified that appellant penetrated her twice in different ways. A psychiatrist at trial testified for appellant that appellant was very passive and was only doing what his controlling wife told him to do. To rebut such testimony, appellee State had the daughter testify that appellant had sexually assaulted her on five prior occasions. Appellee also had one of appellant's ex-wives testify about appellant's violence that occurred during their marriage. The jury found appellant guilty. Appellant challenged. He alleged that the evidence of prior bad acts was not admissible. The court affirmed. The court held that evidence of prior bad acts could be admitted if the probative value outweighed the prejudicial impact. The court held the testimony admissible because it was used to refute the psychiatrist's testimony that appellant was a nonviolent person.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission promulgated new rules regulating concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), which effectively eliminated the right of a party adversely affected by CAFO-generated pollution to request a contested case hearing. Plaintiff non-profit corporation formed to protect property owners from CAFO-generated pollution challenged the rules in the district court, alleging that failure to provide a reasoned justification for the rules, a takings claim, and that the Right to Farm Act, Tex.

The court affirmed, holding that plaintiff lacked standing to raise its takings claim since the relief requested, damages, required participation of its individual members. Further, defendant failed to substantially comply with the reasoned justification requirement since defendant's conclusory statements did not secure the legislative objectives underlying the requirement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to the offense of driving while intoxicated in violation of Tex.

Code &sect; 724.061 and in refusing to suppress evidence of the breath test refusal because of the warning officer's erroneous advice to defendant on the consequence of refusal. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction since defendant had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 724.061 because he could not show that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. Nevertheless, the court found the statute constitutional. The state was not required to show why defendant refused the test in order for the refusal to come into evidence. The warnings received by defendant substantially complied with the purpose of Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 724.015 (Vernon 1999).</SPAN></P>

They appealed alleging multiple errors at the trial court level. The court affirmed the convictions because the evidence was legally sufficient when measured by the elements of the offense as defined by the jury charge. The court also found the evidence was factually sufficient because the contrary evidence did not outweigh the evidence in support of the verdict. Furthermore, the jury charge concerning delivery was not materially different from the indictment and therefore was proper. There was no need of corroboration of the &quot;offer to sell&quot; theory since defendant was convicted of actual delivery. The admission of extraneous offense evidence did not create incurable error that would justify a mistrial. Finally, the defendants did not meet the two-prong Strickland test to show that their counsel's performance was ineffective and unreasonable under prevailing professional norms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Appellant sought review of the trial court's jury charge on punishment. Appellant contended that the court erred in overruling his objection to a portion of the charge, describing the effect of good time credit, when appellant was not eligible to have good time credit counted towards his parole eligibility date. The appellate court first recognized that the Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a) parole law instruction was required to be included in the charge. The appellate court then rejected the contention, concluding that nothing in the record suggested that the jury discussed, considered or tried to apply what they were told about good time and parole. Appellant also contended that the trial court erred in denying his request that the charge include a definition and description of parole. The appellate court rejected this contention, concluding that the purpose of the instruction was to admonish the jury that they were not to consider parole, and that the court did not have to define for the jury a concept which would not be considered in determining punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged his conviction for indecency with a child under Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 21.11(a)(1). He contended that &sect; 21.11 violated the due process provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because it was vague and overbroad and that it infringed upon certain marital privacy rights protected by the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I. This court disagreed and affirmed the conviction. Appellant's challenge to the constitutionality of the statute was limited to whether it was facially invalid because he did not make the challenge at trial. The court found that &sect; 21.11(a)(1) did not implicate a marital privacy right protected by the First Amendment. The statute included intentionally engaging in sexual contact &quot;with the child&quot; and the court could not say that sexual activity in the presence of a child was constitutionally protected. Absent the implication of a First Amendment right, the overbreadth argument failed and appellant had to prove that the statute was vague in all of its applications. Appellant had already conceded that it was not unconstitutional as to him, thus his due process rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

The court held that jurors could testify only to whether any outside influence was brought to bear upon any juror. The court concluded that the affidavit did not reveal any outside influence that was brought to bear improperly on any juror.

Appellees failed to prove any unconstitutional custom approved by appellant's legislative body or final policymaker in the inspection of buildings and issuance of permits. Therefore, the trial judge erred in enjoining appellant's inspections of appellee's apartments based upon the jury's finding of &sect; 1983 liability and the injunction issued by the lower court was dissolved. Appellees did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of appellant's building and rehabilitation code for as-applied vagueness and appellee's as-applied vagueness challenge to the remaining code sections, and the facial vagueness challenge to all of the building and rehabilitation code sections, failed as a matter of law.

The court held that the trial court, as a matter of law, properly defined joint enterprise, and that the evidence at trial sufficiently supported the jury's finding that the entities were engaged in a joint enterprise. The evidence supported the findings that two entities had a common purpose, shared a common business or pecuniary interest, and had an equal right to control the enterprise, the court found. The court found that appellant's liability as a participant in the joint enterprise was based on the resident's negligence as an employee of the foundation. The court rejected appellant's arguments under the borrowed-servant doctrine, sufficiency of the instructions, and admissibility of insurance evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant telephone company was denied a refund of public utility assessment and gross receipts taxes, and sued appellant state comptroller, alleging that the taxes were unconstitutionally imposed upon it, but not upon other similarly situated companies. The trial court held that the suit was barred by limitations, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed the judgment. It held that appellant's suit for refund of the assessments was untimely under the applicable limitations period and that it could not rely on compliance with an intervening change in the law altering the refund claim procedure. It further held that the discovery rule did not preclude appellee from asserting limitations, because the fact that appellant was the only company against which tax was assessed was not inherently undiscoverable. The court held that appellant did not meet the burden of showing the required elements of equitable estoppel or fraudulent concealment, because it did not conclusively establish that appellee engaged in false representations or concealment. The court also held that the claims to recover gross receipts taxes were barred by a settlement agreement entered into by the parties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city sought review of a judgment holding it liable to appellee for taking the airspace over its property, and appellee challenged the denial of its motion to enjoin overflights pending the payment of compensation and by failing to award fees. The court affirmed the judgment and found that appellant's argument that federal height restrictions had long burdened appellee's land did not foreclose appellee's claim that its property was taken by physically intruding into the airspace above its land. The court found no merit in appellant's claim that appellee's overflight complaint was barred by the easement burdening its property, nor that its ordinance restricting the airspace around the airport was a valid exercise of its police power, and the court affirmed the award of damages. On appellee's claims, the court stated that a Texas state court may not assume authority over the airspace by issuing an injunction against further overflights under federal law and declined to hold that the trial court abused its discretion by denying a permanent injunction against further flights.

The trial court granted summary judgment for appellees based on a two-year statute of limitations. Affirming the trial court, the appellate court held that the trial court had not erred in granting the motion for summary judgment based on the two-year statute of limitations. The court explained that any tolling of the statute of limitations was not significant enough to change the result. Even in the breach of fiduciary claim, the two-year statute of limitations applied and not the four-year statute of limitations, as appellants had asserted. Although appellants listed eight other contentions in their appeal, including alleged constitutional violations and failure of the judge to recuse himself, the contentions were overruled. The court noted that the constitutional violations were without argument or supporting authority.</SPAN></P>

After appellant failed a field sobriety test, a blood sample was taken and showed that appellant was intoxicated. Appellant was convicted of driving while intoxicated. Appellant contended the court erred in admitting his statements to police and challenged the constitutionality of Tex. Code Crim. P.

Appellant's statements to police were proven by the alcohol level in his blood sample. Any error in admitting the statements was harmless. Article 37.07 was constitutional because the jury's consideration of a prior unconvicted offense did not constitute additional punishment and did not deprive appellant of liberty without due process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of driving while intoxicated. His first trio of arguments claimed that a culpable mental state should have been required to support the conviction. The court noted that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 49.04 (1998) did not require a criminal or unlawful intent as an essential element of the offense. Appellant next contended that the trial court erred by overruling his motion for a continuance so that he could obtain discovery on the intoxilyzer. The court found no abuse of discretion where the appellant waited until the date that the case was set for trial to try to obtain the continuance, especially because appellant had two years to enforce the discovery order. Appellant's final argument was that the trial court erred when it admitted his videotaped police station interview because it did not contain the warnings required by Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 38.22, &sect; 3(1), (2) (1999). When the videotape was played at trial, it had no sound, so the officer testified to what was on the tape.

The court first explained that appellant failed to preserve the issue for review by presenting the trial court a timely request, objection, or motion stating the specific grounds for the ruling desired, as required under Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1)(A). Further, the court found that had appellant preserved the issue for appeal, the punishment was not disproportionate under U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Using the first factor of the Solem test, the court compared the gravity of the offense against the severity of the sentence and determined that the sentence was within the range of punishment prescribed by the legislature for the crime and that it was not disproportionate to the offense or appellant given his record and his repeated offenses. Accordingly, it was not necessary for the court to reach the remaining Solem factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed appellant's 10 year sentence for driving under the influence, subsequent offense, explaining that he failed to preserve the proportionality of his sentence for appeal as required under state rules of appellate procedure. Further, the sentence was within the range of punishment prescribed by the legislature for the crime and it was not disproportionate to the offense, given appellant's record of repeated offenses.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued on appeal that the sentence was disproportionate to her offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted for the offense of possession of a controlled substance, crack cocaine, between one and four grams, with intent to deliver. She was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment. Appellant argued on appeal that her 12-year sentence was disproportionate to her offense. The court first noted that appellant had failed to preserve the alleged error for review. Even if appellant had properly preserved the alleged error for review, the court found that her sentence did not amount to the imposition of a disproportionate sentence under U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The court concluded that appellant's sentence was not grossly disproportionate to the offense because appellant's sentence was within the range of punishment prescribed by the state legislature for the crime, because appellant had previously been placed on community supervision for possession of a controlled substance, because she had failed to complete community supervision for misdemeanor criminal mischief, because she refused to accept responsibility for her actions, and because rehabilitation was unlikely. Therefore, appellant's contention of error was overruled and the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator applied for a writ of habeas corpus after a contempt and commitment order was issued in connection with a turnover order. Relator argued the contempt order was void as being unconstitutional, and she contended the turnover order was unenforceable by contempt because it made no provision for the deduction of reasonable and necessary business expenses. The court held that the contempt order was void, and ordered relator discharged. The court found that the automatic stay of the underlying bankruptcy proceeding applied only to the civil contempt provision, and that the court could review the merits of relator's writ of habeas corpus related to the criminal contempt. The court determined that the terms of the turnover order made the judgment merely voidable. However, the contemptuous conduct the justice court found was relator's failure to pay funds into the registry of the court on a daily basis. A portion of those funds included attorney fees that were part of the turnover order. Because Texas law did not allow collection of attorney fees by contempt proceedings, the court held that the entire order was void, and that as a result, relator was illegally restrained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator's petition for writ of habeas corpus was granted. Texas law did not allow for collection of attorney fees by contempt proceedings. Because the collection of attorney fees was not punishable by contempt, the entire judgment was void. Accordingly, the order illegally restrained relator, therefore, the writ was issued, relator was discharged, and her bond was released.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it could not address appellants' claims that his plea was not voluntary and that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because a defendant placed on community supervision was required to appeal issues relating to pleas and pretrial motions when community supervision was imposed; the defendant could not challenge such issues for the first time in an appeal from the trial court's revocation of his community supervision.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(e)(4)(A) (Supp. 1999), that reduced the term of appellant's confinement in each case, and that sentenced appellant accordingly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pleaded guilty to charges of theft of property, under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(e)(4)(A). Under the plea agreement, the guilt adjudication was deferred, and appellant was placed on deferred probation. Subsequently, appellant's guilt was adjudicated, and appellant received prison sentences. Later, probation on most of the charges was reduced, appellant's confinement was reduced in each case, and appellant was sentenced. Appellant sought review of the sentences. On appeal, the court stated that appellant only challenged some of the court findings. The court held that the probation revocations were not an abuse of discretion because only one probation violation was required. Furthermore, the sentences were not illegal because the 10-year cap on probation imposed by Tex. Crim. P. Code Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 3 did not apply to deferred adjudication probations, and &sect; 5(b) allowed punishment of appellant regardless of the time that appellant served on the deferred adjudication. Finally, the sentences were not cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII because the sentences were not grossly disproportionate to the offenses. Therefore, judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision that sentenced appellant on reduced terms of confinement for appellant's charge of theft after appellant's deferred probation was revoked because the probation revocations were not an abuse of discretion, and the sentences were not statutorily illegal. Furthermore, the sentences did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because the sentences were not grossly disproportionate to the offenses.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted company's forum non conveniens motions but required company to waive any and all defenses based on the statutes of limitations, pursuant to former Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 71.051(c). Both parties appealed. Residents argued that because their claims arose out of the same series of transactions or occurrences as the Texas residents' claims and because there were common issues of law or fact, the trial court erred in severing their claims. The court affirmed the judgment against residents because distinct factual scenarios would tend to confuse the jury. As to company's appeal, the court found that &sect; 71.051 of the forum non conveniens statute was clear and unambiguous and that company was required to &quot;waive any defense&quot; based on the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded that appellee had properly denied the agent's license to appellant. Appellant complained on appeal that the judgment was not supported by legally or factually sufficient evidence and was an abuse of discretion. The court found that the provisions of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2372p-3 exclusively governed the licensing procedure for bail bondsmen and their agents, and it made any person convicted of a felony ineligible for licensing. Since there was more than a scintilla of evidence that appellant was a convicted felon and upholding the legislature's intent to not license felons was not manifestly unjust, the trial court's decision was supported by both legally and factually sufficient evidence, and no abuse of discretion occurred.</SPAN></P>

The indictment alleged that appellant intentionally and knowingly caused serious bodily injury to a child younger than fifteen years of age by striking her in the head with his hand. The jury charge tracked the language of the indictment. Appellee State of Texas did not offer any evidence that appellant used his hands to commit the crime. In caselaw, the sufficiency of the evidence was measured by the elements of the offense as defined by a &quot;hypothetically correct&quot; jury charge for the case. The manner and means &quot;by striking her in the head with his hand&quot; was not an element of the offense. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Applying caselaw rationale, the court held that the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to show that appellant committed the crime of injury to a child as measured by a hypothetically correct jury charge.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found the defendant guilty of carrying an illegal knife and assessed a one-day sentence and a $ 10 fine. The defendant appealed and argued that the definition of illegal knife was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him, and the trial court erred in including the knife's tang in determining the blade's length. The court held that to preserve an attack on the constitutionality of a statute as applied to the defendant for appellate review, the defendant must raise his complaint in the trial court. Failure to raise the issue before the trial court waived the court's review. As to the defendant's second point of error the court held that the defendant's brief must contain a clear and concise argument for the contentions made, with appropriate citation to authorities and to the record. The failure to cite legal authority or to present a legal theory preserved nothing for review. Tex. R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of sexual assault of a child and aggravated sexual assault of a child under the age of 14. He agreed to enter a plea of nolo contendere in exchange for community supervision and deferred adjudication. Appellant was later found to be in violation of his community supervision agreement and his agreement was revoked. He subsequently filed a motion for rehearing asserting that his plea was involuntary, that the community supervision condition was unconstitutional, that the state did not prove he had violated any law, and that he received ineffective assistance. The court dismissed the plea allegation, and the unconstitutionality allegation for lack of jurisdiction, and found the confession was voluntary. The court noted, however, that the lower court had allowed inadmissible hearsay within hearsay into evidence. Because defense counsel failed to object to the inadmissible hearsay evidence, and because that evidence was the only evidence upon which a revocation could have been based, the court held that appellant's counsel was ineffective and reversed the decision on the sexual assault issue while affirming the decision on aggravated sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was charged with evading detention and filed a pretrial application for writ of habeas corpus alleging that the provision under which he was charged, Tex.

The court found that appellant's notice of appeal was untimely and did not invoke the court's appellate jurisdiction regarding the trial court's order on the pretrial application for writ of habeas corpus, but that appellant's notice of appeal was timely regarding the final judgment entered. Because appellant entered into a plea bargain, he had to meet the special notice requirements of Tex. R. App. P. 25.2(b)(3), so in order to appeal his conviction, appellant's notice had to truthfully state that the substance of his appeal was raised by written motion and ruled on before trial. The court found that appellant's notice did not meet this requirement because the pretrial habeas corpus application was not a &quot;written motion&quot; as contemplated in rule 25.2(b)(2).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged the judgment of the 176th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which found appellant guilty of sexual assault and granted appellee's motion to cumulate thereby ordering that appellant's sentence was to begin after the completion of his life sentence for a prior murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault. The jury assessed punishment at confinement for life. Thereupon, the trial court granted appellee's motion to cumulate and ordered that appellant's sentence was to begin after the completion of his life sentence for a prior murder conviction. Appellant raised various contentions on appeal, contending that the trial court erred in allowing the complainant to testify that another person sexually assaulted her at the behest of appellant. The court held that the trial court, in determining whether to deem evidence relevant to sentencing and thus admissible under Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 3(a), should apply Tex. Rs. Evid. 401, 402, and 403. The court found that because appellant objected to the testimony under rule 403, the trial court had to weigh the testimony's probativeness to see if it was substantially outweighed by the potential for unfair prejudice. Since the evidence was clearly probative as to the aggravated circumstances of the offense, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the testimony. The court overruled the other various claims raised by appellant as well.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for sexual assault because the trial court did conduct a balancing of the probativeness and prejudicial effect of the complainant's testimony in its ruling on admissibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant suspects were assessed a warrant fee by appellee city but were never convicted. Appellants alleged that the fee was statutorily authorized only if appellants were convicted.

Appellee sought summary judgment and alleged that appellants' claims were barred by the statute of limitations and were moot, that appellee was immune, and that appellants failed to request a refund. Appellants sought partial summary judgment. The trial court granted appellee's motion. On appeal the court reversed and held that genuine issues of material fact existed. Appellee failed to establish when one appellant paid the fee and, therefore, that the statute of limitations barred the action. Appellee was not immune because the charging of unauthorized fees was not the implementation of policy decisions on how to collect taxes. Appellants' claims were not moot because there was no evidence that appellee changed the policy. Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 103.008 was not the exclusive remedy for a refund.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction from the 183rd District Court of Harris County (Texas) for aggravated assault. Defendant alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that the jury was improperly charged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of aggravated assault and held that defendant's counsel rendered effective assistance. Defendant had raised several issues on appeal, and the court overruled all of them. First, the court held that evidence of defendant's post-offense conduct was admissible because it met the exceptions to Tex. R. Evid. 404(b), 401, 402, and 403's general bar against extraneous evidence. Defendant had locked himself in his home and threatened the police, which was highly probative of his state of mind following the offense. Second, the court held that because this evidence was admissible, defendant's counsel's failure to object to the evidence did not fall below the standard of reasonable competence. The court ruled that defendant was unable to prove that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because he failed to satisfy the two-pronged test of Strickland, and counsel's actions were part of his strategy. Third, the court found that the jury's charge contained improper language, but held that it was a harmless error because when the charge was read in its entirety, it was unlikely the jury relied solely on the objectionable portion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction of aggravated assault was affirmed. The court held that defendant failed to show that his counsel was ineffective; defense counsel's failure to object to post-offense evidence was irrelevant because it met the exception to the general bar against extraneous evidence. The court found that the jury's charge contained improper language, but held that it was harmless because it was unlikely that the jury relied solely on it.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the evidence concluding the police obtained evidence by violating a statute prohibiting putting unauthorized signs on a state highway right-of-way. Appellant sought review of the trial court's decision to sustain the motion. Appellant argued that even if the initial stop was an unconstitutional detention, it was brief and had ceased to exist at the time of appellee's consent to search, thereby attenuating any taint. The court found that the trial court could have properly concluded the officers' action of placing the &quot;Drug Check Point&quot; sign along the freeway was illegal conduct triggering Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 38.23. Because the contraband was discovered by exploitation of the primary illegality, and not by means sufficiently distinguishable to purge the primary taint, the trial court properly granted appellee's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner appealed a decision from the 304th Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas), finding he engaged in delinquent conduct by committing a first degree felony, specifically by intentionally or knowingly causing the sexual organ of a child to contact his mouth pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.021(a)(1)(B)(iii), (a)(2)(B). Petitioner was assessed a determinate sentence of fifteen years, and committed to the Texas Youth Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury found petitioner engaged in delinquent conduct by committing a first degree felony, specifically by intentionally or knowingly causing the sexual organ of a child to contact his mouth in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.021(a)(1)(B)(iii), (a)(2)(B). Following a disposition hearing, the jury found petitioner to be in need of rehabilitation, assessed a determinate sentence of fifteen years, and committed him to the Texas Youth Commission. Petitioner contended the trial court erred in denying his motion for directed verdict, and the evidence was factually insufficient to support his delinquency adjudication. Petitioner argued it was alleged he caused the sexual organ of the victim to contact his mouth, but the evidence showed he used his tongue. He argued that by definition the tongue was not the mouth, and, further, the penal code made contact by tongue an offense of indecency with a child, not aggravated sexual assault. The court found that the legislature intended the word &quot;mouth&quot; to include its parts such as the teeth and tongue. The court rejected petitioner's argument and affirmed the judgment below.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court overruled petitioner's issues and affirmed the judgment below. The court concluded that a reasonable trier of fact could have found the elements of the offense of aggravated sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the court concluded the trial court did not err in denying petitioner's motion for a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant university was a self-insured government entity. Appellant challenged a court order which awarded attorney's fees and expenses to be paid out of appellant's subrogated interest in the proceeds in the court's registry to the private attorney who represent appellee, appellant's former employee, in a third-party claim and sanctioned appellant. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court rejected appellant's argument that the legislature had not clearly waived immunity of state agencies for suits apportioning attorney's fees in third-party actions. Under Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 417.001(b), 417.002(a) (Vernon 1996), the legislature clearly intended self-insured governmental entities to pay attorney's fees and expenses out of an entity's subrogation lien. The statute did not interfere with the attorney general's exclusive constitutional duty to represent the state's interests. The findings of fact supplied the particularities on the sanctioned conduct lacking in the trial court's order. Since appellant failed to bring forth the record from the hearing on the motion for sanctions, the court presumed the trial court had sufficient evidence to support its findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's order awarding attorney fees and expenses and sanctioning appellant because the labor code provided for self-insured governmental entities to pay attorney's fees and expenses, and findings of fact supplies particularities lacking in the trial court's order on the basis for sanctions.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 162.031(a) and .032(b), in appellee's favor, in the District Court of Hays County, 22nd Judicial District (Texas).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant contractor sought review of conviction for misapplying real property trust funds under Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 162.031(a) and .032(b). Appellant used money deposited for construction on costs other than overhead. The court first rejected appellant's argument that because appellee state included a former statutory exception of use of the funds for non-overhead costs, this particular use became an element of the crime required to be proved at trial. The court explained, under the present statute, the use of the funds to pay actual expenses was an affirmative defense, not a statutory exception. The court noted an unnecessary allegation that did not describe an essential element did not need to be proved at trial. The court further found the sufficiency of evidence for purposes of the verdict was to be measured by the hypothetical correct jury charge and not against the actual charge given as in the present case where the unnecessary element was incorporated into the charge. The court found appellee sufficiently proved appellant diverted funds. The court found that although the case was delayed an inordinate amount of time, much delay was attributable to appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for misapplying real property trust funds because appellee state sufficiently proved the essential elements of the offense and was not required to prove an unnecessary description of an affirmative defense contained in the indictment and jury charge. The court found any delay in a speedy trial was attributable in large part to appellant who later did not vigorously assert his speedy trial right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with felony driving while intoxicated and filed a pretrial application for writ of habeas corpus, which was denied. Defendant was subsequently convicted as charged, and appealed the conviction and denial of his habeas writ. In affirming, the appellate court held that Tex. Crim. P. Code Ann. &sect; 28.061 (1999) infringed upon the prosecution's right to obtain an indictment by setting a certain time period; therefore, the statute was found to be unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers doctrine. The court held that because the statute was unconstitutional, the state was not barred from prosecuting defendant beyond the statute's time period. The court also ruled that a complaint of untimely indictment must be preserved by a pre-indictment objection. Because defendant failed to preserve his complaint of untimely indictment, he was not entitled to dismissal of the charges against him.</SPAN></P>

The court first rejected appellant's argument that the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever. The court found no abuse of discretion when the jury was properly admonished to consider a co-defendant's sexual assault only against the co-defendant. The court further noted during closing argument the jury was further cautioned about considering the testimony in determining punishment against the co-defendant against whom it was admitted only. The court found evidence of prior conviction was properly admitted against appellant in the punishment phase when exhibits of fingerprints were properly identified. The court explained, although the procedure was unorthodox, the prosecution was cautioned that a new punishment trial would be granted in the event appellant's identification was not proven. The court found the denial of appellant's petition for discretionary review was proper when appellant waited nine months before he complained of an untimely indictment. The court found, as a result, that appellant's complaints were waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee corporation was assessed an additional tax under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 171.001-.687, which allowed for the assessment of a prospective franchise tax on corporations incorporated in or doing business in Texas. The franchise tax statute was amended to include &quot;earned surplus,&quot; but not on companies whose only contacts with a state were solicitation of sales of tangible personal property such as a mail order business. Those companies that were not allowed to be assessed an earned surplus tax were assessed an additional tax under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 171.0011(a) (1992). Appellee was dissolved in 1992 and did not pay the prospective tax for 1993 but was assessed one anyway. Appellee paid under protest and filed suit to recover. Appellant state challenged the granting of appellee's summary judgment motion, arguing that the statute was not limited to companies who simply reorganized but applied to companies undergoing various types of changes, including dissolution. The court agreed with appellant and found that the statute was rationally related to a legitimate state interest and therefore constitutional. The court then reversed the granting of summary judgment for appellee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The granting of summary judgment for appellee was reversed and judgment entered for appellant because the corporation could be assessed an additional tax even after dissolution and the statute enabling this assessment was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant installed and owned cables and equipment necessary to supply local exchange telephone service to large apartment complexes.

Appellee ordered appellant to revise its tariff to allow for the surrender of its property for use by property owners. Appellant sought review of appellee's order, which the lower court affirmed. This appeal followed. The court concluded appellee's order amounted to a physical or per se taking of appellant's cables and facilities by requiring that appellant surrender its right to exclude others from physical use of its properties. The court then sought to determine whether appellee possessed the statutory power to issue such an order. The court found the issue was not whether appellee possessed a general power to take private property, but whether the particular action claimed to be a taking in this case was authorized by statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Criminal defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to 50 years in prison. Defendant appealed the conviction on grounds that the lower court erred in instructing the jury on good-conduct time, and also challenged the constitutionality of Tex. Penal Code &sect; 19.02(d) (&sect; 19.02) and Tex. Code Crim. P. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (art. 37). Defendant raised the &sect; 19.02 issue for the first time on appeal and waived its review; however, the court found that defendant did not show how &sect; 19.02 was unconstitutional as applied in his case. Section 19.02 allowed defendant to show that he murdered the victim out of sudden passion as a means to reduce the degree of the felony, but did not unconstitutionally compel defendant to incriminate himself. The court also found that the jury instruction did not misstate the law under art. 37. The charge clearly informed the jury that any good-conduct time defendant earned could not reduce his sentence until he served half of his sentence. Although defendant did not preserve his separation of powers challenge, the court found that art. 37 conformed to Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect; 11(a) because it allowed courts to inform juries about the effect of good-conduct time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Criminal defendant's murder conviction was affirmed because the lower court's jury instruction regarding the effect of good-conduct time on defendant's sentence conformed to statutory and constitutional requirements, and defendant did not properly preserve issues for the court's review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecution appealed an order from the 23rd District Court, Brazoria County (Texas), which dismissed appellee's re-indictment for the offense of felony criminal mischief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee was charged with engaging in organized criminal activity by an indictment. Thereafter, he was reindicted for felony criminal mischief. The trial court dismissed appellant's reindictment on the ground that it was not filed within the second term of the grand jury, and as such violated Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 32.01 (1997). On appeal, the prosecution contended that art. 32.01 only required that a defendant be indicted within the second term of the grand jury from the time of his arrest. Here, appellee was indicted before the second term of the grand jury in the original indictment. Therefore, art. 32.01 was not violated by the indictment. The court agreed. It concluded that art. 32.01 did not preclude prosecution from advancing alternative theories or charges arising out of the same criminal transaction once the prosecution had acted within the timetable prescribed by art. 32.01 for initially securing an indictment. Further, because appellee was indicted prior to the motion being heard, art. 32.01 could not be used to dismiss the indictment, even though it was returned by a grand jury at a subsequent term of court. The court reversed and remanded the action for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff tenants appealed a judgment from the County Civil Court at Law No. 1, Harris County (Texas), granting defendant landlord's writ of certiorari, dismissing plaintiffs' reentry action, declaring Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When plaintiff tenants sought defendant landlord's consent to assign their lease, defendant locked plaintiffs out of the space. Plaintiffs filed a writ of reentry action in justice court pursuant to Tex. Prop. Code &sect; 93.003 (&sect; 93.003). Defendant sought review of the writ of reentry by writ of certiorari to the lower court. The lower court granted the writ, dismissed plaintiffs' reentry action, declared &sect; 93.003&nbsp;unconstitutional, and awarded defendant attorney fees. On appeal, the court noted that neither party could assert new claims or causes of action in the lower court that had not been asserted in the justice court. If defendant did nothing more than resist plaintiffs' right to recover, plaintiffs had an absolute right to nonsuit. The court found that in defendant's prayer for relief, it only asserted matters in denial of or defense of plaintiffs' claim for reentry, including the request to strike down &sect; 93.003. The court also noted that the lower court had no jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment. Because defendant had no claim for affirmative relief in the lower court, plaintiffs had a right to nonsuit. The judgment was vacated and the case was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellant's convictions were supported by legally and factually sufficient evidence that complainants, as employees, had better rights to the stolen property than did appellant.

Plaintiff appealed and contended the trial court erred in dismissing the case because defendant failed to perform a ministerial act of providing plaintiff with the information he requested.

Therefore, defendant did not have a mandatory duty to provide plaintiff with the information he requested. The decision to release information was left to the discretion of defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff care facilities appealed the decision of the District Court of Travis County, 201st Judicial District (Texas), entering judgment in favor of defendant Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation and denying plaintiffs attorney's fees in their suit seeking declaratory judgment that rule defendant adopted regarding classification and reimbursement of plaintiffs for Medicaid-contracted beds was unlawfully retroactive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs operated intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded (ICF/MRs). Defendant Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation provided notice that it was considering adopting a rule that would classify ICF/MRs based upon the number of beds operated as Medicaid-contracted beds and reimburse them based upon that classification. Since small and medium-sized facilities were to be reimbursed at a higher rate than large facilities, plaintiffs reduced their numbers of Medicaid-contracted beds in anticipation of the adoption of the rule. Defendant then adopted an amended version of the rule which classified plaintiffs on a date prior to the rule's adoption, causing plaintiffs to be classified as larger facilities. Plaintiffs sought judgment that rule was unlawfully retroactive pursuant to Tex. Hum. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 22.019. Judgment was entered in favor of defendant, and plaintiffs were denied attorney's fees. Plaintiffs appealed. The appeals court reversed because &sect; 22.019(a) expressly prohibited the retroactive application of a rule enacted by defendant, and denial of attorney's fees was remanded for reconsideration in light of appellate court's disposition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment in favor of defendant Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation regarding retroactivity of rule it adopted was reversed because Texas law expressly prohibited the retroactive application of any rule enacted by defendant.

On review, the court found when the trial court asked if there were any objections to the charge, defense counsel responded, &quot;No, Your Honor.&quot; The court noted that a defendant who affirmatively stated he had no objection to a jury charge had voluntarily relinquished his right to challenge on appeal any error in that charge. Moreover, the court noted the trial court was mandated to give the precise instruction complained of pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a). Because the trial court could not have erred in giving an instruction mandated by legislation, defendant's counsel could not have been have been ineffective for failing to object to the legislatively mandated instruction.

The trial court then conducted a punishment phase on each charge. During that phase, appellee prosecution introduced evidence of an extraneous offense in which appellant stole a woman's purse at gunpoint. Appellant did not file any objection, and he stipulated to evidence that he had been convicted of several other crimes. The trial court, finding the enhancement allegation true, then increased the offense to a first degree felony from a second degree felony.

The county court of appeals, however, expressly stated that the verdict and its findings were not final, pending appellant's 30-day probation. Appellant sought review within the 30-day period.

Appellant also alleged that his other conviction for theft occurred prior to an amendment of the Act. The court affirmed summary judgment in favor of appellee because appellee did not err in denying appellant a license. The amendment to the Act specifically made the Act retrospective such that appellant's theft conviction could be considered by appellee. The court determined that it was the legislature's intent that the phrase &quot;involving moral turpitude&quot; only modified misdemeanor offenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both parties sought review of a decision from the 158th District Court of Denton County (Texas), which awarded plaintiff estate and beneficiary actual and punitive damages and prejudgment interest under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.  &sect; 41.008(b) in a wrongful death and survival action arising from defendant owner's and manager's negligence while decedent resided at defendants' nursing home</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant nursing home owner and manager asserted there was insufficient evidence to support the award of damages in plaintiff estate and beneficiary's wrongful death and survival action. Because of defendant manager's failures to provide adequate staff, plaintiffs' decedent's needs were not met and the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of defendant manager's negligence and gross negligence. A limitation on punitive damages was not constitutionally prohibited, but the trial court did not err in capping the punitive damage award because Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem Code Ann.  &sect; 41.008(b) included compensatory damages. The trial court also did not err in including wrongful death damages in computing the cap because the actual damages to be quadrupled encompassed the actual damages awards to all plaintiffs. Prejudgment interest was not a part of plaintiffs' actual damages and the inclusion of such in the computation of the punitive damages cap was reversed. Because there was evidence that plaintiffs brought the wrongful death action on behalf of all beneficiaries joinder of plaintiff beneficiary's brother was not required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed where the lower court's calculation of damages against defendant nursing home owner and manager properly included all actual damages and plaintiff beneficiary's brother was not a necessary party to plaintiff estate and beneficiary's wrongful death and survival action. However, prejudgment interest was not properly included in actual damages, and that portion of the lower court's judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Code Crim. P. Ann. art 32.01 (1966).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pled guilty to a charge of possessing a deadly weapon in a penal institution and was sentenced to four years confinement. He challenged his conviction, contending that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss an untimely returned indictment under former Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 32.01, which required that an indictment be returned during the next term of court after a defendant's arrest. In affirming, the appellate court rejected appellant's arguments that the indictment was not timely returned because it was not returned during the next term of court after his arrest and that his motion to dismiss, although filed after the indictment's return, was timely brought. Article 32.01 had no application once the indictment was returned, even though it was returned by the grand jury at a subsequent term of court; thus, appellant's motion was not timely. Further, at the time of his arrest, appellant was incarcerated after a felony conviction. He was not improperly detained in custody to answer for the weapon possession charge and suffered no deprivation of his freedom other than those he already suffered as a convicted felon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed because the trial court properly denied appellant's motion to dismiss the untimely returned indictment under the former statute, because this provision had no applicability once an indictment was returned, even though it was returned by the grand jury at a subsequent term of court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A conviction of evading detention was affirmed because the officer reasonably attempted to detain defendant to investigate an expired license plate with no registration sticker attached. Defendant failed to stop when the officer attempted to pull her vehicle over, and she was convicted of evading detention under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.04(a) (1994). The appellate court affirmed the conviction, finding an investigatory stop lawful because the officer had a reasonable suspicion that defendant had violated the vehicle registration laws. Because defendant did not object to the jury instructions, she was required to show on appeal that any error in the instructions caused egregious harm. No such harm resulted from instructions on dealer license plates or the prosecutors' comments on the evidence. Defendant also failed to preserve for review her claims as to speedy trial and whether the court provided the jurors with the jury handbook.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty of driving while intoxicated (DWI). Defendant was charged with DWI by having a blood/alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more and by losing the normal use of his mental or physical faculties from alcohol under Tex. Pen.

Defendant moved to suppress his breath test results, to dismiss the 0.10 allegation because the State did not preserve his breath test sample, and to declare certain statutes and regulations concerning breath tests unconstitutional. The trial judge denied the motions and found defendant guilty. Defendant challenged the denial of his motions. The reviewing court found defendant's challenges related only to the breath test. Defendant did not challenge the information's loss-of-use paragraph or the sufficiency of the evidence supporting it. Neither did he move below to suppress any evidence other than his breath test results. Therefore, the court held that even had the trial judge erred in denying defendant's motions, the error would have been harmless because the judgment would still stand on the loss-of-use allegation alone.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was found guilty of boating while intoxicated. He challenged the decision arguing that the enforcement provision of the Water Safety Act (Act), Tex. Parks &amp; Wild. Code Ann. &sect;&sect;31.001, 31.124 (1991), violated U.S. Const. amend. IV and that he was denied a speedy trial. Specifically, he argued that the officer's stopping of his boat simply to check for water safety equipment violated his right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. The court disagreed noting that the seizure, while suspicionless, was analogous to a sobriety checkpoint and furthered the promotion of a legitimate government interest in protecting its boaters. The court also found that the detention was not unreasonable and that, given the detachability of various safety items, the only reasonable way to check for the equipment was a mid-river seizure. The court further held that, even though the trial was delayed, appellant never asserted his right to a speedy trial and did not suffer the requisite prejudice. The court then affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant State of Texas sought review of a decision from the 82nd District Court, Robertson County, Texas, which pursuant to the Workers' Compensation Act, Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 417.003(a), awarded counsel of appellee employee one-third of appellant state's workers' compensation subrogation lien. Appellee employee had pursued a negligence claim against a third-party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee state employee was injured in an automobile accident during the course of his employment. Appellee settled a negligence lawsuit he brought against a third-party driver. Appellant State of Texas did not actively participate in the lawsuit. The trial court awarded appellee's counsel one-third of appellant state's workers' compensation subrogation lien for attorney fees pursuant to the Workers' Compensation Act (Act), Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 417.003(a). Appellant state contended &sect; 417.003(a) was unconstitutional because it permitted a private attorney to represent a state agency. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The appellate determined that appellant state challenged the wrong statute, but that even if it had challenged the appropriate statute,&nbsp;Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 417.001, its challenge would fail because that provision did not violate Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22 because it did not unequivocally supplant the Attorney-General in his authority to prosecute the suits of the state.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the applicable statute was constitutional as it merely allowed appellee to recover his fees from appellant state's subrogation lien and did not authorize appellee employee to institute an action to recover appellant state's lien.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant insurer brought an interlocutory appeal from certification of two classes of life insurance policy purchasers from the 192nd Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas), asserting that the lower court abused its discretion in certifying the class because it failed to conduct a rigorous analysis of class certification prerequisites and because the classes did not satisfy the criteria of Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court considered whether the lower court erred in granting class certification. Concluding that no abuse of discretion was shown, it affirmed that decision. Appellant insurer provided no authority that required the lower court to set forth reasoning for its ruling. Thus, appellant insurer did not demonstrate that the lower court failed to conduct a rigorous analysis. Further, the record provided some evidence in support of commonality as required by Tex. R. Civ. P. 42(a) and appellees' claims were typical of the absent class members. Thus, the record supported the finding that appellees were adequate class representatives. Where there was some evidence to support a conclusion of predominance, the court declined to reverse the lower court's certification ruling. It also held that it could not say the lower court abused its discretion in finding a class action was a superior method of adjudication. There was no reversible error or abuse of discretion, and the court affirmed the class certification order.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d &sect; 4 , in appellee's favor, in the County Criminal Court N0. 2 of Tarrant County (Texas).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant prosecution sought review of the grant of appellee driver's motion to suppress statements made at an accident scene under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d, &sect; 4. Appellee hit a roadside sign while driving while intoxicated and his wife was injured. When the police arrived, appellee initially claimed his wife was driving. Upon further investigation of the accident scene, the police questioned appellee about whether he was really the driver. After appellee admitted driving, the police administered a sobriety test. The court first concluded under the plain language of the accident statute, appellee was not in custody because he was neither required to make any statement to the police or remain at the scene when the injured passenger was his wife and presumed to already have the knowledge the statute required a driver to impart to the injured party. The court reversed and remanded, concluding appellee was not entitled to Miranda protections until police formally arrested him even though he was required to remain at the scene pursuant to an investigative stop because the stop at most escalated from a consensual encounter to an investigative detention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While appellant and his ex-girlfriend were eating at a restaurant, man one and man two entered ex-girlfriend's house and took television sets, a computer, a video set recorder, as well as other property. Appellant went with man three to pawn some of the stolen property. Appellant contended that the evidence was factually insufficient to support his conviction, specifically arguing that the weight of the evidence showed that he was not involved in the burglary and that man two was not credible because man one testified that appellant was not involved in any plan to burglarize ex-girlfriend's home. After reviewing all the evidence, the court concluded that the finding of appellant's guilt was not so against the great weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. The court rejected appellant's argument that his fine was unconstitutional, finding that the $ 300 fine was within the range of punishment allowed by statute, and that because appellant had not shown he was imprisoned for failure to pay his fine, assessment of a fine did not violate his equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a state department of insurance, an attorney general, and an individual, sought review in a consolidated appeal of orders from the District Court of Travis County, 98th Judicial District (Texas), which granted temporary and permanent injunctions on the applications of appellees, automobile insurance companies and trade associations. Both injunctions prohibited appellant department from releasing information to appellant individual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed a trial court's grant of summary judgment to appellees, automobile insurance companies and trade associations, in their action to enjoin the disclosure by appellant department of insurance of certain quarterly market reports, and dissolved a permanent injunction. The reports contained information concerning written premiums, policy and membership fees, and other data. The court found that the quarterly market report information was not excepted by the Texas Public Information Act, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 552.112, because insurance companies were not financial institutions within the meaning of the section and the section was a permissive exception that the government could waive. The trial court did not, however, abuse its discretion in granting a temporary injunction on the ground that the report information amounted to trade secrets. Accordingly, the court affirmed that part of the trial court judgment issuing a temporary injunction on the ground that the report information constituted trade secrets, but modified the temporary injunction to, among other things, delete that part of the order authorizing disclosure of information to appellee association.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, city and officials, asserted that certain accident reports were confidential by virtue of Tex. Rev.

Appellee attorney general had ruled that dispatch logs, from which the requirements of &sect; 47(b)(a)(D) necessary to obtain the accident reports could be obtained, were public records within the meaning of the Texas Public Information Act, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 552.001-.353, by letter opinion. Based upon the doctrine of separation of powers, the court affirmed, rejecting appellant city's assertion that it had discretion to withhold accident reports from individuals who took advantage of the dispatch logs to obtain confidential information. The discretion sought would permit appellant city to sit as a legislative and judicial body, as well as an executive body. The court also rejected appellants' assertions that the issue of intervenor requestor's standing was ripe for consideration, as the standing issue could bear on the counterclaims intervenors asserted against appellant that remained pending before the trial court and had no bearing on the trial court's grant of summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the lower court upholding appellee attorney general's ruling that dispatch logs were public information was affirmed, and appellants, city and officials, did not have the power to withhold confidential accident reports where the information required to withhold them was publicly available in dispatch logs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of his conviction for driving while intoxicated. Appellant contended that the jury charge was erroneous because it did not require a culpable mental state, but the court concluded that it had never been necessary to plead scienter in a prosecution for driving while intoxicated. Rather, the court held that appellant could be convicted of DWI even though he might have in good faith believed that he was competent to drive. Appellant further contended that Texas Penal Code Ann. &sect; 49.04 was unconstitutional because it did not require a mens rea element. However, the court determined that there was a presumption that the statute was valid and that appellant had not met his burden of establishing its unconstitutionality. The court also concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction and that appellant had not preserved his objection to extraneous misconduct evidence, because he had not objected to the testimony at trial. Therefore, the court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant patient sought review of a judgment of the 131st Judicial District Court, Bexar County (Texas), that granted appellee doctor's motion for summary judgment on the basis of the statute of limitations in an action for medical malpractice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After appellant patient learned her gall bladder problem was misdiagnosed as biliary cancer, she sued appellee doctor for malpractice. The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment on the grounds the suit was barred by the statute of limitations under the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4509i, &sect; 10.01 (Vernon Supp. 1999). Appellant sought review, and the court reversed and remanded. Under &sect; 10.01, a two-year statute of limitations period was applied to medical malpractice claims. Where misdiagnosis was alleged, the date of the misdiagnosis or failure to diagnose was the date the limitations period began running, and the continuing nature of the diagnosis did not extend the tort for limitations purposes. Here, the date of appellant's misdiagnosis was more than four years prior to her filing suit. However, she did not discover the misdiagnosis until one year before filing suit. Therefore, &sect; 10.01, as applied to appellant was unconstitutional because it was impossible for her to bring the action before she knew of it. A statute that unreasonably abridged a right of redress was a denial of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Summary judgment in favor of appellee doctor dismissing appellant patient's medical malpractice suit was reversed and remanded because the statute of limitations was unconstitutional as applied to her. The statute cut off her right to sue appellee before she learned of the misdiagnosis that gave rise to her claim.</SPAN></P>

Although the judge should not have signed the judgment because he had recused himself, the court remanded the case to the trial court for reformation of the judgment by the judge who presided over the trial, to sign it. The lower court did not err in denying appellant's motion to quash, contending the complaint and information were vague because the information sufficiently tracked the statutory language of the provision of the Transportation Code that appellant violated. The court lacked jurisdiction over appellant's argument that suspending his license was unconstitutional for automatically depriving him of a property right. Because the Transportation Code provided for a separate appeal from the suspension of a driver's license, the court could not review the suspension of appellant's license as part of his appeal. Appellant's equal protection challenge failed because he did not show he was a member of a class treated differently from others in the same class.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was indicted for forgery of a writing. The state amended the indictment to charge appellant with forgery of a commercial instrument. Appellant moved to quash the indictment, but the trial court denied the motion. Appellant was convicted and sought review. The court found that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 32.21 was not unconstitutionally vague, particularly regarding appellant's specific conduct. Further, the court found that the indictment was sufficient to charge appellant with forgery of a commercial instrument because appellant exchanged the slip for merchandise and knew her actions were unlawful. The court found that the trial court did not error in denying appellant's motion to quash the indictment because the indictment was sufficient on its face to provide adequate notice to appellant. In addition, the court found that any rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant's statement referred to the forgery of complainant's slip.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged his conviction from the 130th District Court of Matagorda County, Texas, of twelve charges of sexual assault, the court assessing concurrent 16-year sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant on 12 charges of sexual assault perpetrated on complainants who were all female parishioners and students of a school at which he was pastor and principal. Appellant asserted the evidence regarding the sexual assault of certain complainants was legally insufficient to sustain his conviction because neither victim made a timely outcry and their testimony was uncorroborated. He argued that Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 38.07 required that an alleged victim who was 14 years of age or older at the time of the alleged offense must either make an outcry statement within six months of the incident or there must be evidence to corroborate her testimony. Appellant argued that the 1993 amendment to art. 38.07 to eliminate the outcry requirement if the victim was under the age of 18 was unconstitutional because it was in effect an ex post facto law. The court held that art. 38.07 was merely a procedural change and did not allow conviction on less evidence than was required when the offense was committed. Thus, the law in effect at the time of appellant's trial in 1997, the version amended in 1993, applied. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction on charges of sexual assault on the grounds that the evidence against defendant was overwhelming. An amendment to the statute eliminating the outcry requirement for certain complainants was constitutional because it was merely a procedural change.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the 183rd District Court, Harris County (Texas), convicting of him of possession of cocaine. Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress all evidence seized during a traffic stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was stopped by police after he committed a traffic violation. Before stopping the vehicle, a license check revealed the owner of the vehicle had an outstanding arrest warrant for traffic violations. The officer then frisked defendant to search for weapons, felt a bulge in one of his pockets, and suspected that it was crack cocaine. He asked defendant what the bulge was, and defendant replied that it was crack. After the court denied his motion to suppress the seizure of the evidence and that statement that the bulge was crack cocaine, defendant was convicted of possession of cocaine. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction, holding that police were entitled to conduct a pat down search because there was a reasonable suspicion defendant was armed. Furthermore, the court stated that because the officer felt an object whose shape identified it as contraband, a warrantless seizure was justified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals affirmed the judgment convicting defendant of possession of cocaine. The court held that the officer had the right to perform a frisk during a traffic stop in order to be sure that defendant was not armed and defendant voluntarily told the police officer that the bulge in one of his pockets was crack cocaine. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a jury trial in the Criminal District Court of Dallas County (Texas), defendant was convicted of aggravated assault in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.02 (1994). The jury assessed punishment at twenty years confinement in the state penitentiary. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While &quot;tripping&quot; on &quot;wack,&quot; a combination of marijuana, PCP, and embalming fluid, defendant put a gun to his friend's face and shot him one time. The victim survived despite massive injuries. After finding defendant guilty of aggravated assault, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.02 (1994), the jury assessed punishment at twenty years' imprisonment. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support defendant's conviction. There was no evidence that the shooting occurred because of any event other than defendant's voluntary act of pulling the trigger. Moreover, under &sect; 8.04(a), which satisfied the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, voluntary intoxication was no defense because it could neither render a physical action involuntary nor negate a culpable mental state. While the &quot;bodily injury&quot; element of aggravated assault was a &quot;result of conduct&quot; element, the use of a deadly weapon was a &quot;nature of conduct&quot; element. Thus, it was not error to include both definitions of intentionally in the charge. Finally, no evidence supported a &sect; 6.01(a) voluntariness instruction as to defendant's physical body movements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for aggravated assault, holding that the evidence was legally and factually sufficient, a Texas penal statute providing that voluntary intoxication was not a defense to the commission of a crime met the constitutional requirements of due process, the trial court's jury charge defining intentional was proper, and the trial court correctly refused defendant's requested jury charge on accident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A temporary injunction barring defendant administrative agency from relying on an interpretation of gambling devices was affirmed pending the outcome of a declaratory judgment action filed by plaintiff, an association of amusement machine operators. Association members operated eight liners that were similar to slot machines and dispensed gift certificates. Based on a state attorney general opinion, defendant issued memoranda to its agents defining prohibited gambling devices to include eight liners. Plaintiff association could not sue on behalf of its members for a declaration that seizure of the machines would be unconstitutional or for an injunction prohibiting such seizures. However, it could seek to enjoin defendant from relying on invalid rules as that action would not require participation of individual members of plaintiff. Defendant's memos were rules under the state administrative procedure act because enforcement of guidelines in the memos would affect every eight liner owner. Plaintiff did not have to sue defendant's director individually because the trial court had jurisdiction under the administrative procedure act to issue an injunction against a state agency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged a judgment of the County Criminal Court at Law No. 15, Harris County (Texas), which convicted him for driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor driving while intoxicated (DWI), appellant refused to submit to a requested breath test. Thereafter, appellant moved to suppress the evidence, claiming that he was subjected to an illegal detention, search, and seizure. The trial court denied appellant's motion. Appellant pleaded no contest to the charge, and the court found appellant guilty and sentenced him to 180 days in jail, probated for a period of two years. Appellant challenged, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress and asserting that Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 724.061 was unconstitutional. The court disagreed, finding that appellant had waived any errors in the denial of his suppression motion by not objecting with sufficient specificity. The constitutionality issue had been fully addressed in an earlier appeal and was determined adversely to appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment was affirmed; appellant was properly convicted for misdemeanor driving while intoxicated because investigatory stop of his vehicle, his detention, and subsequent arrest were properly supported by officer's reasonable suspicion that appellant had been drinking, and probable cause was based on failure of field sobriety tests and admitted consumption of beer.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that sovereign immunity was waived for apportionment actions and that the assessment of attorney fees to a private attorney after a third-party action in which the attorney general declined to participate did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers. Res judicata did not apply, the state court was the appropriate forum to rule on plaintiff's claim for fees, and the court acted reasonably in ruling that each party should bear its own fees for the instant action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant suspected that his girlfriend-victim was seeing another man. When the victim came home, appellant threatened her with a gun and forced her to have sex. The victim during this time pushed the gun away, which went off, blowing off her right hand and seriously injuring her left hand. Appellant was indicted for attempted capital murder. The case was tried to a jury, which found appellant guilty of aggravated assault. Appellant challenged his conviction, arguing that the jury instruction was unconstitutional. The court held that the jury instruction properly gave an instruction on reasonable doubt as a standard of proof of extraneous offenses at the punishment phase of the trial. The court also determined that the jury instruction as to good-conduct time was incorrect as a matter of law, violated appellant's Due Process rights, and was unconstitutional under the state and federal constitutions. However, the court concluded that considering the record as a whole, the entire charge, the nature of the offense, and the punishment assessed, appellant had not shown the erroneous jury instructions resulted in such egregious harm that he did not receive a fair and impartial trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court and held that even though appellant's jury was given an incorrect statement of the law, which violated appellant's rights to Due Process, the error was harmless, and appellant received a fair and impartial trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Decedent's son appealed from a decision by the Webb County Trial Court (Texas), granting decedent's illegitimate daughters' motion for summary judgment, in an action brought seeking a declaration of intestate heirship. Decedent's son argued that it was error to grant his sisters' motion for summary judgment on the issue of heirship, in holding his sisters were the heirs of decedent, and in denying his motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the trial court granted decedent's illegitimate daughters' motion for summary judgment in an action to determine heirship, decedent's son appealed. The court held that the appeals court statement, to the effect that daughters' claims to intestate heirship were without merit, did not create a controlling law of the case that must be followed in all subsequent litigation. The law of the case doctrine was discretionary and could not be used to reach an unconstitutional result. Further, when the case was remanded from the appeals court, it was sent back without instruction and the case then stood on the trial court's docket as if it had never been tried. The court held daughters could not be denied the judicially enforceable right to lay claim to an estate on the basis of legitimacy unless the denial was substantially related to an important state interest. The court held that daughters demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence they were decedent's biological descendents. Evidence included affidavit by decedent's sister, documents in which decedent acknowledged his relationship, and copies of checks decedent sent to children dividing equally property sold by the decedent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of decision from the 363rd Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas) convicting him of murder. Appellant contended that the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to support his conviction as a principal and as a party, that the trial judge erred in failing to apply an abstract definition of causation to the facts of the case in the jury charge, and that Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of his murder conviction. Appellant alleged insufficiency of the evidence, trial court error in failing to apply an abstract definition of causation to the facts in the jury charge, and unconstitutionality of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.02 . Appellant contended the victim was already dead when appellant shot him and that the trial judge erred in failing to apply an abstract jury instruction on causation. The court disagreed, where appellant and other perpetrators all shot the victim multiple times, and each shooter inflicted fatal wounds; appellant's actions were alone sufficient to cause the death, and appellant was not entitled to the instruction. Appellant contended that &sect; 19.02&nbsp;unconstitutionally violated his due process rights because it shifted the burden of persuasion to appellant to show he acted in the heat of sudden passion. The court concluded that under Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a), to preserve a complaint for appellate review, appellant must present a timely, specific objection at trial, and failure to make objection waived even constitutional errors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pled guilty to intentionally causing bodily injury to an elderly person, and was found to have engaged in delinquent conduct. The judge committed defendant to a youth commission for five years. Appellant sought review in this court, asserting that the trial court erred in failing to grant his pre-trial motion to quash the petition. Specifically, he argued that Tex. Fam. Code &sect; 53.045(a)(7) (1996), upon which his conviction was based, was unconstitutionally vague and violated Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 19 because the statute did not define the minimum age at which a juvenile offender's sentence could be determined. This court affirmed the trial court's judgment, concluding that &sect; 53.045(a)(7) applied to appellant because he was a child who engaged in delinquent conduct, as the terms were statutorily defined, and committed the penal offense of injuring an elderly person, one of the enumerated offenses. The court further held that &sect; 53.045(a)(7) was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave a person of average intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct was forbidden, it created little or no risk of arbitrary enforcement, and it proscribed appellant's conduct.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court stated that the trial judge had broad discretion to dismiss prisoner lawsuits if the suit was frivolous or had no arguable basis in law pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.

However, appellant did not sue that officer but brought action against three other supervisory officers. Therefore, appellee contended there was no arguable basis in law for appellant's claim because appellant never claimed that appellee supervisory officers affirmatively participated in the acts that injured him. Because appellant did not allege, under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, that appellee supervisory officials affirmatively acted to cause the injury or implemented unconstitutional policies that caused the injury, the trial judge did not err.

The court found that appellant's request to reverse the revocation order for denial of a speedy hearing in accordance with Tex. Code Crim. P.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant husband challenged the lower court's decision to award his ex-wife a portion of his military retirement benefits. Appellant claimed that his wife had been previously married and that there was no record of a valid divorce from her first husband. A jury determined that appellee did not knowingly deceive appellant about her previous marriage. Based on this decision, the court did not set aside the parties' property settlement. Appellant later filed several lawsuits in different jurisdictions seeking to have the settlement agreement set aside. The lower court then permanently enjoined appellant from filing any new actions regarding the same matter. The appellate court held that appellant's claims regarding bias on the part of the judge were waived because appellant failed to object in a timely manner. The appellate court also held that appellant's request to have his previous marriage declared void were part of the original proceedings and were therefore barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Finally, the appellate court upheld the lower court's permanent injunction entered against appellant in order to prevent appellant from harassing appellee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction by jury for the offense of aggravated sexual assault in the 93rd District Court of Hidalgo County (Texas). Defendant's appeal on remand was based on challenges to the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence and allegations of improper jury argument by the prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a trial by jury, defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child under the age of 14. Defendant's case was remanded to the trial court on another issue and after that proceeding resulted in affirmation of his conviction, he appealed on two additional grounds. Defendant challenged the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence against him. Upon review, the court held that the jury's verdict was not so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence so as to be clearly wrong and manifestly unjust. Defendant also challenged the content of the prosecutor's closing argument. The prosecutor referred to other alleged crimes in his closing, which were not admissible as evidence. Because the appellate court held that this error was not corrected at the trial court level and that the error was not harmless, defendant's case was reversed and he was granted a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant prevailed on appeal and his conviction was reversed due to improper jury argument by the prosecution, wherein the prosecutor referred to other alleged criminal acts supposedly committed by defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for retaliation on several grounds. Defendant alleged that the statute for retaliation, under which he was convicted, was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.

Defendant also contended that the evidence was factually and legally insufficient to support a guilty verdict. The appellate court found that a rational trier of fact could have found that defendant's actions constituted retaliation and therefore the evidence was both factually and legally sufficient. Defendant's last two contentions, that the trial court committed error and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, were found to be without merit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of his conviction for driving while intoxicated, claiming the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress evidence. Appellant contended the arresting officer did not have probable cause to suspect appellant of driving while intoxicated or to arrest him for the offense. The court affirmed the conviction, finding the evidence supported a finding of probable cause. The court determined that the officer was legally investigating an automobile accident caused by appellant. The court found that during the course of that investigation the office noticed an odor of alcohol on appellant's breath, noticed that his speech and appearance were abnormal, and noticed his eyes were glassy. The court concluded that all of the foregoing, together with statements regarding appellant's driving, gave the officer probable cause to believe that appellant was driving while intoxicated. The court did not consider appellant's allegations regarding the conclusory nature of the stipulations or regarding the incorrect warnings that he was given because appellant failed to preserve those issues for appeal pursuant to Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Tax exempt bonds were issued by a public housing authority. Relator bank sold the bonds to the public as the original bond indenture trustee. Plaintiffs, purchasers of the bonds, filed an action against several defendants, including relator, alleging that the rehabilitation project was not completed and relator was negligent in failing to insure that only authorized issuance costs and expenses were paid to the underwriter at bond closing. Plaintiffs also contended that relator otherwise breached its fiduciary duties. Relator's motion to have the action transferred to the county where its principal office was located was denied by the lower court. On review, the court found that there was no prima facie evidence in the record that relator's principal office was located in the county where it sought to remove the action. Venue was proper in the county in which the principal office of any of the corporations was located. The court thus denied relator's petition for a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of aggravated assault and sentenced to eight years in prison. On appeal, appellant asserted two points of error. First, appellant argued that the statutory amendment that elevated the classification of the offense of aggravated assault from a third-degree felony to a second-degree felony violated the equal protection clause. Appellant's point, however, was decided directly against him in a prior case. It had been held that the amendment to Texas Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.02 was not in violation of the equal protection clause or constitutionally unsound. Next, appellant argued that he was denied reasonably effective assistance of counsel at the guilt-innocence and the punishment phases of the trial in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VI and Tex. Const. art. 10. Appellant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence, however, his ineffective assistance claim. Appellant did not show that counsel's performance was deficient by norms of the community to the extent that counsel failed to function as the &quot;counsel&quot; guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. VI, nor did appellant show that counsel's performance prejudiced him. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the 198th Judicial District Court, Kerr County (Texas), which convicted him on three counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a continuance, in denying his motion for change of venue, and in allowing certain witness testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted on three counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child. He first appealed his judgment of conviction on the basis that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a continuance. On appeal, the court held that there was no error because defendant willingly changed attorneys three times and was warned after the second time that the court would not grant a continuance. Second, defendant contended that the court erred in denying his motion for change of venue due to the unfavorable treatment of his case in the press. Upon review, the appellate court found that the newspaper article at issue simply gave appellant's name and the crime charged, and did not constitute sufficient evidence of prejudice. Third, defendant objected to certain witness testimony, especially that of the victim. Defendant claimed that due to the fact that the victim was four years old at the time she testified, she was not a competent witness. The appellate court found no error and found that the record established that the victim was able to differentiate between the truth and a lie.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that appellant's inventory was properly valued pursuant to &sect; 23.01(a) and that there had been no abuse of discretion by the trial court that warranted a reversal because there was sufficient evidence to support the court's findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of intoxication manslaughter. At his jury sentencing hearing, the trial court permitted the jury to be informed of appellant's prior juvenile delinquency adjudication for vehicular manslaughter and allowed the jurors to hear victim impact testimony. On appeal, appellant argued that allowing the jurors to learn of his juvenile delinquency adjudication was error since at the time he committed intoxication manslaughter the adjudication was inadmissible at sentencing. Appellant further argued that the admission of victim impact testimony was unduly prejudicial. The appellate court affirmed. It reasoned that, as to the juvenile delinquency argument, neither the ex post facto clause of the federal nor the state constitution was implicated inasmuch as the change in admissibility was a procedural rather than a substantive matter. As to the victim impact testimony, the court held that the claim was not preserved for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err in admitting appellant's juvenile delinquency adjudication for vehicular manslaughter since a statutory modification allowing admission of the evidence after appellant's crime was procedural rather than substantive in nature.

After the court granted summary judgment to appellee, appellant sought review.

The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to appellee because the record showed that appellee conclusively proved that appellant's medical negligence action was barred by the statute of limitations. In addition, appellant failed to plead a deceptive trade practices (DTP) cause of action that was not barred by the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act, Tex. Bus. &amp; Com.

The trial court dismissed her case for failure to comply with art. 4590i, &sect; 13.01(a). Appellant challenged the dismissal, contending the cost bond and expert report requirements violated federal and state due process protections. The court affirmed. Because the record lacked evidence of appellant's financial inability to comply with art. 4590i, &sect; 13.01, she failed to meet her burden of showing that the statute did not meet constitutional requirements.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged an order of the 184th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which convicted him by a jury for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. The jury assessed his punishment at 36 years imprisonment, which was enhanced by two prior felony convictions. Appellant raised several issues on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following several disputes, appellant put a small automatic pistol to his girlfriend victim's head and shot her once. Appellant was convicted by a jury for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and his punishment was assessed at 36 years imprisonment because it was enhanced by two prior felony convictions. Appellant challenged the conviction, raising several assignments of error. The court held appellant's plea of true to the indictment's enhancement paragraphs and his stipulation to the evidence of the prior convictions thereby waived his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting those enhancement allegations. The court also rejected appellant's argument that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at the punishment stage because there was nothing in the record which reflected that his trial counsel encouraged him to enter a plea of true to the enhancement allegations and stipulate to evidence of his prior convictions. The court also found the statutory instructions given to the jury were not &quot;misleading&quot; and were relevant to appellant's offense; the trial court did not err in submitting the unobjected to statutory instructions. The order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and his resulting sentence of imprisonment that was enhanced by two prior felony convictions, was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant exemplary school district sought review of a trial court decision that held that appellant was not exempt from Tex.

The &quot;requirements and prohibitions&quot; that appellant was exempt from under &sect; 39.112 referred to educational and not financial impositions. Such an interpretation did not contradict Chapter 41's plain language and was supported by legislative history. Section 39.112 waived educational oversight for districts such as appellant with the highest educational achievement standards, but did not waive their required participation in the school finance system. The trial court decision was not an advisory opinion because it involved a present controversy and not merely hypothetical issues. The trial court did not err in failing to strike intervenors' pleadings or in allowing intervention in the instant action. Allowing intervention was within the discretion of the trial court and the intervenors had an interest in the outcome of the case at bar because it involved a constitutionally efficient and equitable school system.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant filed a habeas corpus application after he was charged with a misdemeanor offense of violating a city camping ban ordinance. Appellant sought pretrial relief, alleging that the ordinance was unconstitutional.

On appeal, appellant asserted that the trial court erred in refusing to hear testimony, and contended that he did not have an adequate remedy at law. The city attorney challenged the trial court's decision that appellant was sufficiently restrained of his liberty to entitle him to habeas corpus relief. Because the record was insufficient, the appellate court could not decide the issues. Not only was there no complaint in the record charging appellant with an offense, the ordinance that appellant claimed he was charged with violating was not included in the record. Therefore, the appellate court vacated the judgment and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed grant of appellee's motion for summary judgment because appellee nonetheless presented summary judgment proof showing that, as a matter of law, the fishing ban regulation was effective and precluded appellants from seeking damages for the toxic spill in the bay.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of the judgment from the Criminal District Court No. 2, Dallas County (Texas), upon a sentence imposed by a jury at a new trial solely on appellant's punishment for his burglary conviction. Appellant alleged that the exclusion of evidence exonerating him from guilt violated Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 37.03, &sect; 3 and art. 44.29(b), and that the trial court miscalculated his credit for time already served.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted and sentenced for burglary. After habeas proceedings, the court remanded the case for a re-trial solely on the punishment phase pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. P. 44.29(b). At the re-trial, the trial court did not permit appellant to introduce evidence pertaining to his guilt, and entered judgment on the jury's determination of punishment. On appeal, the court held that the phrase in Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 44,29(b) allowing a defendant to offer evidence of the circumstances of the crime was redundant with the same phrase in Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 3(a), and that the phrase referred only to circumstances relevant to assessing punishment, and not to appellant's guilt. Thus, the exclusion of exonerating evidence was not error. However, the trial court erred in calculating the amount of credit that appellant was entitled to for the time he had already spent in jail. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment but modified it to give appellant the correct amount of credit against his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment on appellant's new trial on the punishment phase, although the court modified the sentence by recalculating the credit for time served. The court held that appellant had a statutory right to introduce evidence relevant to sentencing, but he had no right, statutory or otherwise, to introduce evidence pertaining to his guilt. Thus, the trial court properly excluded exonerating evidence at the re-trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant attorney sought review of the judgment of the 385th District Court of Midland County (Texas) finding that he violated Tex. R. Prof'l Conduct 1.01(b)(1), 1.15(c), and 1.15(d) by intentionally disobeying a court order to represent an indigent and committing other egregious acts. Appellant urged, among numerous claims, that he was forced to defy the court order by the professional conduct rules.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed a judgment as modified finding that appellant attorney violated Tex. R. Prof'l Conduct 1.01(b)(1), 1.15(c), and 1.15(d) and suspending him from the practice of law for one year followed by a probated suspension. Appellant intentionally disobeyed a court order to represent an indigent, falsely told the indigent that the judge found he was not entitled to an attorney, ignored notices, and failed to communicate with the indigent regarding the content of notices. The court rejected appellant's various claims, including that due process violations occurred, that the Rules were vague, that the evidence was legally and factually insufficient, and that he was forced to defy the judge because appellant deemed himself incompetent to represent the indigent, and that the ethical rules placed the determination of competence solely on appellant. Appellant failed to consider the more specific rules concerning court appointments, which required that appellant continue representing the indigent despite good cause for termination. The court agreed that the judgment incorrectly stated that it was agreed and modified the judgment to delete any reference to an agreed judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment that appellant attorney violated professional rules of conduct. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that appellant violated the ethical standards at issue. Appellant's various grounds for appeal lacked merit, except that the judgment incorrectly stated that it was agreed. The judgment was modified merely to delete any reference to an agreed judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant brought suit against appellee for medical malpractice. Appellee thereon moved for summary judgment on the grounds that appellant's claims were barred by the statute of limitations, which was granted by the trial court. On appeal, the court found appellant had not filed suit until well after the expiration of the two-year limitations period. Consequently, her suit was barred by the provisions of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (1999). The court found no evidence attached to appellant's response to the motion for summary judgment establishing that appellee's failure to tell appellant, at the time of the surgery, that he used non-absorbable stitches amounted to fraud or fraudulent concealment. Additionally, because appellant failed to sue for nearly two years after learning of the alleged injury, the court concluded that, as a matter of law, appellant did not file suit against appellee within a reasonable time after discovering her alleged injury. Therefore, the open courts defense raised by appellant did not save her lawsuit from the statute of limitations. Appellant's action was thereby barred by the statute of limitations, and the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged an order from the 183rd District Court, Harris County (Texas), in which the court entered judgment revoking deferred adjudication for two counts of robberies and imposed a sentence accordingly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment revoking deferred adjudicating for two counts of aggravated robberies was affirmed. In affirming the lower court's judgment, the appeals court held that appellant could not appeal a determination to adjudicate guilt. The court further held that appellant failed to establish that he was denied any constitutional rights. The appeals court held that Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 1.15 allowed an accused to waive his right to a jury trial and such waiver constituted a waiver of the compulsory process. The appeals court next held that the lower court did not commit error by considering the presentence investigation report. The court held that Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 9(c) authorized the use of the presentence investigation report to assist the trial court in determining the appropriate punishment after defendant pled guilty or nolo contendere. The appeals court also held that the sentence imposed on appellant was within the statutory range of punishment and was not so plainly disproportionate as to shock the sense of humankind and, thus, constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

There was sufficient legal and factual evidence that appellant's product proximately caused appellees' injuries because it was shown that appellant's product's emitted dust with dangerous levels of asbestos and that appellee workers came into frequent contact with the dangerous substance. Compensatory damages were justly awarded based on properly admitted expert testimony regarding appellee workers' health woes, and there was no indication that the jury was improperly influenced by passion or sympathy. The consolidation of appellees' actions was proper because they shared common factors and the consolidation did not unfairly prejudice appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff appealed an order from the 108th District Court of Potter County (Texas) that granted summary judgment in favor of defendant magistrate and defendant city in an action for malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, abuse of process, intentional infliction of emotional distress, interference with contract, violation of state constitutional rights, denial of due process, and violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff sued defendant magistrate and defendant city for malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, abuse of process, violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and other claims. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendants, and plaintiff appealed. The appellate court reversed the portion of the judgment that denied recovery for the civil rights claim and affirmed the remaining portions. Defendant magistrate's actions were protected by judicial immunity when he complained to defendant city about noise from plaintiff's business that was disrupting court operations. His acts were judicial in nature and within his jurisdictional authority. Sovereign immunity was inapplicable to defendant city to the extent that intentional torts gave rise to a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Where plaintiff was never imprisoned or otherwise detained, false imprisonment could not constitute a basis for relief under &sect; 1983, but none of the defenses proffered by defendant city warranted denial of the purported &sect; 1983 claim based on malicious prosecution. Defendant city failed to meet its burden of establishing the absence of a policy, practice, or custom as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the trial court did not err in issuing a temporary injunction against appellant renters for violating Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 1.14-1 and that the injunction was not void for vagueness. Appellants had brought a declaratory action maintaining that they were not violating art. 1.14-1 by offering various moving-related insurance packages to their customers. Appellee state counterclaimed seeking to enjoin appellants' practice of selling the packages as the unauthorized sale of insurance. Finding that appellants had engaged in the unauthorized business of insurance, the trial court granted appellee's motion for an injunction. In construing the statute the court found that the legislative intent sought the broader goal of deterring unauthorized insurance business in general. In light of the determination the court found that it was not error to issue the injunction because appellants had engaged in the unauthorized business of insurance prohibited by art. 1.14-1. The evidence also established that appellants acted as local recording agents in the sale of insurance. The injunction was not overly broad because it prevented appellants from circumventing it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order, which enjoined appellant renters from selling insurance packages because the sales constituted the unauthorized business of insurance and the injunction was specific enough to prevent appellant renters from circumventing it.</SPAN></P>

On remand from the Texas Supreme Court, the trial court granted summary judgment for appellee. The court reversed and remanded the trial court's summary judgment order on the claim of unconstitutional taking. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the basis of the statute of limitations because appellee had not articulated this argument. Although appellants had failed to plead the necessary intent for an unconstitutional taking, appellee did not establish its lack of intent. With respect to appellants' other claims, the court affirmed the trial court's summary judgment order because appellants had merely pleaded mental anguish and not personal injury or death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Holding that appellant had not followed the procedural requirements to obtain review of the denial of his request for appraisal under Tex.

The court held that appellant had failed to file a timely written protest of the denial of his application, as required by Tex. Tax Code &sect; 41.44. The court found no evidence that appellant had protested the matter within 30 days of receiving his tax bill, which indicated that his property had not been appraised as open space under &sect; 23.51.

The court held that &sect; 42.08 did not violate the open courts provision of the state constitution.

The court noted that appellant had not argued below that the stipulation was merely conclusory. Therefore, pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1)(A), appellant had waived this complaint. Nevertheless, the court concluded that the stipulation contained evidence competent to show that the officers had reasonable suspicion to detain and probable cause to arrest appellant. The court found that because the officers saw appellant turn the wrong way down a one-way street, they had probable cause for a traffic stop. When they noticed that appellant smelled of alcohol, had difficulty exiting his vehicle, speaking, and paying attention, they had reasonable suspicion to conduct a DWI investigation. The court rejected appellant's contention that the state had to prove that the field sobriety test administered was reliable. The court rejected without comment appellant's claims that Tex. Transp. Code &sect; 724.061 (Pamph. 1999) was unconstitutional, and that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress evidence of appellant's breath test refusal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for driving while intoxicated. The court held that appellant had not preserved for review his claim that the stipulation in the motion to suppress consisted of conclusory statements, and not facts which would support a detention or arrest. The court also held that there was no basis in law for requiring the state to prove that its field sobriety tests were trustworthy indicators of intoxication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the County Criminal Court at Law No. 15, Harris County, Texas, which convicted appellant of driving while intoxicated, on appellant's plea of nolo contendere. Declaring Tex. Transp. Code &sect; 724.061 constitutional, appellant claims the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, and denying his motion to suppress evidence of his breath test refusal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court declined to review the denial of appellant's blanket suppression motion. The court held that the ground appellant asserted as error, that the stipulation for the motion contained conclusory statements and did not set forth the reasons why the arresting officers concluded that appellant was intoxicated at the time of his arrest, was not argued to the trial court on the motion, as required by Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1)(A) to preserve the issue for appeal. As to appellant's challenge to the constitutionality of Tex. Transp. Code &sect; 724.061, the court noted that appellant had pleaded no contest to the charge against him. Accordingly, appellant lacked standing to assert the constitutionality of &sect; 724.061, because his refusal to submit to blood alcohol concentration testing was never offered in evidence against him. Therefore appellant could not establish that the operation of the statute prejudiced him, and his challenge was merely hypothetical. Finally, the court held that a warning read to appellant in connection with the blood test, which tracked the language of Tex. Transp. Code &sect; 724.015, was not void, and did not render his refusal to take the test involuntary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for DWI. Because appellant had not attacked a stipulation of facts as conclusory at his suppression hearing, he waived the issue on appeal. The court held that appellant lacked standing to assail an evidentiary statute's constitutionality, because he did not go to trial, and the evidence was not offered against him. The court also held that appellant's refusal to submit to a blood test was voluntary.</SPAN></P>

The appellant was in the back seat of a vehicle along with three friends. The four individuals were attempting to burglarize a residence when the officer confronted them.

The appellant raised eight points of error, including an allegation that the trial court erred in denying the appellant's motion to quash an untimely indictment. The appellant was initially not indicted for capital murder; the count of capital murder was added after the initial indictment for burglary. The court found that because the first indictment for burglary was timely, the later indictment for capital murder that arose out of the same criminal conduct or transaction was also timely. The court rejected all of appellant's additional points of error and affirmed his conviction.</SPAN></P>

The indictment charged defendant with retaliating by striking an officer at the unit. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, contending that the indictment was untimely under Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 32.01 (1989) because he was not indicted until nine days after his arrest. The prosecution responded by asserting that defendant was not detained to appear in answer to a criminal accusation and, therefore, Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 32.01 did not apply. Based on the testimony and documents admitted during the hearing, the appellate court concluded that defendant was not arrested and detained to answer the retaliation charge but that he remained imprisoned as a consequence of his earlier conviction. The restrictions and loss of privileges he incurred did not change the status of his detention. Accordingly, the court overruled defendant's motion and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was stopped and frisked by a police officer, who found crack cocaine in appellant's pocket. Appellant then fled from the officer.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.06(a)(1), (c)(1) (1994) and Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.112(a), (b) (1998). On appeal, appellant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence and challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support his escape conviction. The court affirmed the denial of the motion to suppress as well as appellant's cocaine conviction because it found that, under the totality of the circumstances, the officer had sufficient grounds to fear for his own safety to justify frisking appellant's outer clothing for weapons. However, the court found the evidence legally insufficient to support appellant's conviction for felony escape because there was not a showing that the arrest had been completed before appellant fled.

The trial court did not err in refusing to suppress appellant's written statement because appellant was fully advised of his rights and voluntarily confessed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of his conviction from the District Court of Caldwell County, 22nd Judicial District (Texas) for two offenses of aggravated sexual assault in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.02(a)(1)(B)(i)(iii), (2)(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was indicted and tried seven months later for aggravated sexual assault. At his trial, the state introduced evidence of past convictions. Appellant's conviction and sentence under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.02(a)(1)(B)(i)(iii), (2)(B) were upheld. The version of the speedy trial statute applicable to appellant's case had been held constitutional. Appellant did not timely apply for relief under the statute. He did not file his motion until over 19 months after he was indicted. An examination of the appellate record failed to reveal the date of appellant's arrest or his bail bond. Without that information, it was not possible for the court to tell when the next term of court expired. Appellant's testimony did not open the door for impeachment past the usual parameters of Tex. R. Evid. 609. However, the trial court gave an adequate limiting instruction to the jury in the court's charge. The prior convictions were limited to the credibility of appellant's testimony, and the jury was told not to consider them for any other purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed appellant's conviction because appellant did not timely apply for relief and failed to prove he was not indicted timely, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing evidence of appellant's prior convictions to be presented at the guilt/innocence stage of the trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant fireman challenged an order from the 281st District Court, Harris County (Texas), which granted appellee retirement fund's motion to dismiss appellant's administrative action seeking judicial review of the denial of his retirement credit transfer under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant fireman joined the fire department and appellee retirement fund. Appellant sought credit for years of service working in other fire departments toward his retirement with appellee. While his request was pending, appellee adopted a new interpretation of the retirement credit transfer statute,&nbsp;Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6243e.2(1), &sect; 16(a). The new interpretation held that years worked outside the city could be credited to appellee only if the former city also had a statutory firefighter's fund. Thus, appellee denied appellant's retirement credit request. Appellant sued appellee for its denial. Appellee moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and the trial court dismissed appellant's claims. The appellate court affirmed the order, holding that appellant could not challenge appellee's credit decision until the earliest possible date he would be eligible to retire, as described by statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, city employee, sought review of decision affirming denial by appellee, Texas Workforce Commission, of unemployment benefits. Appellant suffered a work related injury. His employment was terminated and he filed for unemployment benefits while receiving workers' compensation benefits. Appellee found lack of compliance with Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 201.011, and denied claim. Appellant argued if he had applied for unemployment benefits at time he was terminated, he would have been disqualified by Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 207.049, because he was receiving worker's compensation benefits; such disqualification prevented him from applying within time limit of Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 201.011, and the two statutes conflicted. The court disagreed, holding that Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 201.011 required appellant to file his claim within the time limit, not file and qualify. Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 207.049 did not address filing a claim. Appellant argued Tex.

Second, the prosecutor was not found to have commented on appellant's failure to testify. The comment at issue was found to have been aimed at another witness.

The court affirmed the judgment of dismissal finding that it was not mandatory for the court to conduct a hearing to decide whether the suit should have been dismissed under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. &sect; 14.004(c). The court found that because the claim was frivolous, the trial court was statutorily permitted to dismiss the suit before service. Therefore, because appellees were never served, the court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing the case before they filed answers. The court held that the dismissal of the lawsuit did not constitute a denial of appellant's right of access to the courts under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 and under U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's single point of contention on appeal was that the trial court's punishment charge was fundamentally erroneous because it contained an instruction on parole law that was confusing and misleading.

Appellant nevertheless asserted that the trial court erred in giving the instruction because it was confusing and misleading. The court found that it could not conclude that the trial court erred in giving an instruction required by the code of criminal procedure, and further found that it would have been error had the trial court failed to give the instruction. The court also rejected appellant's assertion that a jury could not rationally consider the existence of parole law without considering the manner in which it would apply to him, finding that the parole law instruction clarified for jurors a law about which they tended to speculate, and was not confusing or misleading.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff licensee of gambling machines was told he could no longer place his gambling machines in a bingo parlor after the lessor received a letter from defendant lottery commission. Plaintiff did not have a lottery license. Plaintiff filed a declaratory judgment suit that requested the court declare his machines were not gambling devices within the meaning of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 47.01(B)(4) (1998). The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, and plaintiff appealed. The court affirmed because the separation of powers doctrine prevented courts from issuing advisory opinions. Because plaintiff did not hold a lottery license and was not personally affected by defendant's letter, any opinion would have been advisory. The court found plaintiff was not entitled to an injunction because defendant did not threaten any action, and injunctions were only proper to prevent a party from engaging in an activity. The court found the letter written by defendant was within its powers; therefore, it was not within the definition of the Tex. Gov.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee Railroad Commission of Texas enacted field rules to govern the drilling, completion and operation of wells in the Texas Panhandle. After being sued for allegedly violating certain of theses rules, appellants, oil and gas companies, filed the present lawsuit to determine the validity and applicability of the rules. In the petition, appellants sought declaratory relief that the rules violated various state and federal statutes and constitutional provisions. The trial court dismissed appellants' case on jurisdictional grounds. On appeal, the court concluded that the trial court did have jurisdiction to review the validity of the rules pursuant to Tex. Gov't Code Ann.  &sect; 2001.038 for three reasons: because the rules fell within the statute's definition of &quot;rule&quot; and meet the general requirements for an administrative rule; the proceeding through which the rules were adopted did not qualify as a &quot;contested case&quot; under the statute; and appellee was statutorily required to use trial-type procedures in promulgating field rules. Accordingly, the court reversed the trial court's order dismissing appellants' suit and remanded the cause to that court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the District Court of Travis county, 261st Judicial District (Texas), which affirmed an order of appellee Board of Law Examiners that appellant lacked the good moral character required for admission to the state Bar.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court rejected appellant's argument that appellee Board of Law Examiner's finding -- that appellant lacked the moral character required for Bar admission -- was unsupported by substantial evidence. Rejecting the claim, the court pointed to appellant's unauthorized practice of law, his violation of accountancy regulations under which he was licensed as an accountant, the provision of auditing services in violation of federal agency standards, and ruled that appellant's testimony attacking witnesses was not credible. Further, there existed a rational connection between appellant's negative character traits and the likelihood of client injury or obstruction of justice. Nor was the statute regulating the unauthorized practice of law unconstitutionally vague, as it provided clear warning of proscribed conduct. An injunction and consent order barring certain appellant activity was not res judicata as to his moral character, as they did not involve appellee concerns. Due process objections of appellant lacked merit, as he received notice of his hearing and was heard. Finally, no right to a jury trial attached to a suit for appellate review of appellee's administrative decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment affirmed that appellant lacked the good moral character required for admission to the Bar of Texas, because substantial evidence revealed appellant's unauthorized practice of law and violation of accountancy standards for licensed accountants, as client injury or obstruction of justice likely, as controlling statute on unauthorized practice of law not constitutionally vague, and as due process rights of appellant observed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of his conviction from the 265th Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas) for failing to register as a sex offender. Appellant claimed that his punishment under the sex registration statute violated the ex post facto clause of the Texas Constitution and that the law was unconstitutionally applied to him because it added an additional punitive measure to an act previously committed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted for failing to register as a sex offender. He sought review of the conviction claiming that his punishment under the sex registration statute violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws because the statute was not in effect when he was convicted of a sex-related offense. Appellant also claimed that the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to show that he knowingly or intentionally failed to register as a sex offender. The court affirmed the conviction first explaining that the statute did not violate the ex post facto clause of the Texas Constitution because the duty to register was a collateral consequence of a guilty plea that was remedial rather than punitive in nature. Further, although the penal institution failed to advise appellant of his registration requirements upon release, the evidence showed that his parole officer so informed him and thus no error was shown by prosecuting him for failure to register within seven days of being so informed. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction based on appellant's admission that he was told he was required to register but did not do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This appeal involved a license revocation resulting from a driving while intoxicated arrest. In two points of error, appellant government challenged the trial court's reversal of the finding against appellee driver by the administrative court. Appellant argued that appellee did not prove to the county court that the administrative law judge's decision was arbitrary or capricious or not supported by substantial evidence. The court found that reasonable minds could have concluded from the evidence that appellant refused to submit a breath specimen. Further, substantial evidence indicated that probable cause existed to believe that appellee was operating a motor vehicle in a public place while intoxicated. Therefore, the court concluded that there was substantial evidence to suspend appellee's license. Accordingly, the court reinstated the order of the administrative court.</SPAN></P>

Code Crim. P. art. 38.37, which allowed the admission of evidence of extraneous incidents, was unconstitutional because it reduced the burden of proof to a standard less than beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The events relating to the offense for which appellant was charged and convicted took place at appellant's home. The victim was 8 years old and friends with appellant's son. Victim testified that appellant initiated sexual contact with him. Victim also testified, over appellant's objection, to two extraneous incidents. Appellant contended that Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 38.37 was unconstitutional on its face because it effectively reduced the burden of proof to a standard less than beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore, violated the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. By its very terms, article 38.37 did not alter the burden of proof in the enumerated offenses. The article did not address the burden of proof. The trial court's charge did not alter the burden of proof. Article 38.37 did not impermissibly lessen prosecution's burden of proof because prosecution was required to prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Article 38.37 allowed introduction of extraneous offenses between a defendant and a child victim to show the states of mind of the defendant and child and their relationship. Appellant's conviction was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state filed a motion for rehearing, challenging a decision of the 241st Judicial District Court of Smith County (Texas), and pointing out that appellant had four previous convictions that were not reflected in the opinion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state filed a motion for rehearing, stating that appellant had four previous convictions not reflected in the court's opinion. Appellant had challenged his trial court conviction of injury to a disabled individual, his wife, contending trial court error in overruling his motion to suppress certain photographs of the interior condition of their home that had been taken by the independent executor of the estate of the owner of the house. The court overruled the state's motion for rehearing, withdrew their original opinion, and substituted a corrected opinion that made reference to the appellant's prior misdemeanor convictions for driving while intoxicated, criminal trespass, carrying a prohibited weapon, and theft by check. The court could not determine whether the photographs taken of the squalid conditions where appellant's disabled wife lived with him, for which appellant had sought suppression, had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict. However, because appellant's wife had possession of the house where she lived with appellant, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded the trial court judgment because it could not determine whether photographs taken of poor conditions in the home where appellant's disabled wife, who had possession of the house, lived with him had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict. The court overruled the state's motion for rehearing and issued a corrected opinion stating appellant's prior misdemeanor convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of her conviction from the District Court of Comal County, 22nd Judicial District No. CR95-327 (Texas), for unlawfully appropriating more than $ 20,000 but less than $ 100,000 without effective consent in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(a), (b)(1) (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Victim had suffered a stroke and appellant was a neighbor who, for a fee, helped care for victim. Victim regained most of his physical strength, but continued to have difficulty speaking. Victim's daughter visited and noticed a new car in appellant's driveway. A bank employee informed daughter that victim and appellant had been at the bank and victim had attempted to withdraw an undetermined sum of money. Victim had recently withdrawn large sums of money from other accounts. Appellant produced a notarized statement in which victim stated that he was giving the car to appellant. A decision convicting appellant of unlawfully appropriating the money in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(a), (b)(1) (1994) was affirmed. Victim was impaired in his ability to make reasonable, rational decisions, and someone who saw victim frequently should have known that. A rational fact-finder could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant exercised control over the car. The verdict was not so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong or unjust. The words &quot;diminished&quot; and &quot;capacity&quot; were easily understood by a person of ordinary intelligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the conviction because victim suffered from a diminished capacity to make rational decisions, the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the jury's verdict, and the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pled no contest to the charge of indecency with a child and was sentenced. On appeal, he complained that his conviction was void because the judge reviewed his pre-sentence report prior to making a finding of guilt and that his eight-year sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. As to the pre-sentence report, the appellate court held that the judge's review of the report did not violate appellant's due process rights. Specifically, the court found that appellant's guilt was established before the trial court even ordered the pre-sentence report. The sole use of the report, the court said, was to aid in determining whether to give appellant deferred adjudication or a probated sentence. As to the cruel and unusual punishment claim, the court held that appellant failed to inform the court what was unique about his case that would support this claim. Further, the court said, the trial court assessed punishment within the range proscribed by law. Thus, because the appellate court found no merit to appellant's arguments, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment against appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the 248th District Court, Harris County (Texas), convicting him of possession of less than one gram of cocaine in violation of Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.115(b) (1992 and Supp. 1999).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction of possession of less than one gram of cocaine. The court held that probable cause existed to search defendant because the search was incident to defendant's arrest for failing to signal two lane changes in violation of Tex. Transp. Code &sect; 545.104. The court found that the trial court's decision to give credit to the officer's fact rendition was not clearly erroneous. The drug evidence seized during the search was thus properly admitted. Defendant's sentence was properly enhanced under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.42(A)(1), (2) (1994 and Supp. 1999) because defendant's crime was a state jail felony and it was uncontroverted that he had been previously convicted of two felonies. Defendant failed to establish that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 1.15 denied him the opportunity to present evidence or violated his compulsory process and due process rights. Defendant waived all of his rights under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 1.14, and there was no requirement that he specifically waive his compulsory process right. The court therefore affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order convicting defendant of possession of less than one gram of cocaine was affirmed because the search that produced the incriminating evidence was incident to a lawful arrest and the trial court's decision to believe the officer's testimony was not clearly erroneous. Defendant's sentence was properly imposed under the sentencing guidelines and defendant failed to prove that his compulsory process rights were violated or not waived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged a trial court decision that convicted him of capital murder after a jury trial and sentenced him to life in prison. The appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court. Appellant's conviction was supported by sufficient evidence. The evidence was factually sufficient to support the finding that appellant intended to kill his victim in the course of a robbery. A witness' statement that was made in the context of the victim's description of the events made immediately after he was shot was admissible under Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 803(a) as a hearsay exception for excited utterances. A jury instruction was sufficient to remove any prejudicial effect of a prosecutor's improper closing argument. The state's capital murder scheme was constitutional. The capital murder sentencing scheme did not violate appellant's due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. V and U.S. Const. amend. XIV and did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Since appellee, the state, waived the death penalty in the instant capital murder case, the enhancement element was waived and there was no need to offer mitigating factor evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision convicting appellant of capital murder and sentencing him to a mandatory life sentence.

Appellee state's capital murder scheme did not violate due process or constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The implication of the broadcast was that appellee had a quid pro quo relationship with the restaurant owner. Appellee was transferred to a different department as a result of the broadcast and received a reprimand from his employer. The appellate court reversed denial of summary judgment on appellee's claims, holding that appellee, as a member of a group, had no cause of action for defamation because any libelous statements were directed at the group and did not single him out.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sexually oriented business sought review of a decision form the Tarrant County District Court (Texas), which granted appellee municipal adjusting board's motion for summary judgment on appellant's claims that appellee improperly denied a specialized certificate of occupancy to operate a sexually-oriented business because it conflicted with Fort Worth, Tex., City Code app. A, Ord. 3011, &sect; 18A(B)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sexually oriented adult business applied for a specialized certificate of occupancy to operate at a location that was within 1000 feet of an existing church. The city in which appellant sought the permit had a local ordinance, Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 243.006(a) (1999); Fort Worth, Tex., City Code app. A, Ord. 3011, &sect; 18A(B)(2) that restricted such establishments from operating within 1000 feet of a church, school, public park, residentially-zoned property, designated historical or cultural district, or other sexually-oriented business. Appellee adjustment board denied appellant's permit. Appellant sought judicial review of the denial, and the lower court granted appellee board's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed, reasoning that despite the fact that one of the church's halls was not connected to the church, the hall fell within the ordinance's definition of a church because people regularly assembled there for activities intended primarily for purposes connected with religious worship. The ordinance was sufficiently narrowly tailored to achieve the city's interest and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Decision of the lower court granting appellee adjustment board's motion for summary judgment on appellant's claims that it was entitled to a specialized operating permit was affirmed. The appellate court held that appellant failed to establish that appellee board's decision was illegal or that appellee board abused its discretion in denying appellant's application.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.011(a)(2)(A) (Supp. 1999). Appellant challenged the judgment, asserting the statute imposed disparate treatment for the same act based solely upon the age of the actor in violation of the equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. and Tex. Const., and the trial court erred in denying his discovery request for the criminal juvenile records of the victim and a state witness. The court held appellant's equal protection claim was reviewable, although raised for the first time on appeal, because he challenged the constitutionality of the statute itself. The court held the creation of an affirmative defense for underage children not more than three years older than the child with whom they had engaged in sexual conduct, based on the recognition of a difference in judgment, maturity, and ability to control conduct between children and adults, was not violative of equal protection. The court held appellant's request for criminal juvenile records was properly denied because he failed to establish good cause, materiality, and that the state had the information. The conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Relator claimed he was indigent and requested appointed counsel pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 157.163(b)(d) (1996). The trial court judge refused to appoint counsel for relator because it found that relator had not attempted to borrow money from relatives to hire an attorney. Therefore, the trial court judge signed an order stating that relator was not indigent and not entitled to counsel. Relator was jailed for 23 days before he was granted bail. Relator sought habeas corpus relief arguing that he was illegally restrained under the trial court's order of commitment. The habeas court set aside the trial court's order of commitment and held that whether or not relator had attempted to borrow money from relatives was an improper factor for the trial court to consider in determining relator's indigency. Therefore, the court found that the trial court unconstitutionally deprived relator of his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Disputed questions of fact concerning operation of a segregated unit in a county jail in which inmates were taught fundamentalist Christian principles required reversal of summary judgment and remand to determine whether the unit violated the Establishment Clause of U.S. Const. amend. I. Although county and county sheriff defendants contended there was a policy against proselytizing in the unit, plaintiff former inmates and county residents produced evidence that instructors were attempting to convert inmates to Christianity. However, county resident plaintiffs had no standing as taxpayers because defendant sheriff did not spend public tax money on the unit that he would not spend otherwise in operating the jail. A claim by an inmate that he was denied free exercise of religion by not being provided with the same accommodations as the Christians could be dismissed on summary judgment because an incidental burden on protected religious conduct was reasonable in relation to operation of the prison. Equal protection claims also were properly dismissed because there was no evidence of a sufficient number of inmates of other faiths to justify similar units for them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant worked part-time delivering pizza. Upon making a pizza delivery to complainant's home, appellant engaged the complainant, a 10-year old boy, in conversation. Appellant then reached down and rubbed the boy's chest both inside and outside of the boy's shirt. Appellant was charged and he pleaded guilty to the offense of indecency with a child, pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.11(a)(1). On appeal, appellant argued that the statute under which he was convicted failed to make a gender distinction between touching the breast of a male and a female child, and thus failed to provide fair notice, contrary to due process requirements. He contended that touching the breast of a male child would not ordinarily be considered sexual in nature. The court held that the statute was constitutional. It determined that it was touching accompanied with the requisite sexual intent that was criminal, and not merely touching. The statute did not prohibit innocent touching of a male child. The court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Order convicting appellant of indecency with a child was affirmed because the requisite sexual intent accompanying the touching distinguished the offense from innocent touching of a child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a survival action initiated as a personal injury suit, plaintiff, the administratrix of a nursing home patient's estate, and defendant nursing home both appealed a judgment of the Tarrant County District Court (Texas). A jury had awarded the estate $ 2.37 million in actual damages and $ 90 million in exemplary damages for injuries the bedridden patient had suffered due to the nursing home's negligent and grossly negligent medical care.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient developed severe pressure sores requiring painful debridement due to medical neglect. She died while her personal injury suit was pending. Classifying the nursing home as a health care provider&quot; and the suit as a &quot;health care liability claim&quot; under the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i (1999), the trial court reduced actual damages to $ 1.54 million, plus prejudgment interest and, under former Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 41.007 (1994), reduced exemplary damages to $ 9.48 million. On appeal, the court rejected the home's argument that art. 4590i, &sect; 11.02 was intended to cap exemplary damages as well as compensatory damages or that prejudgment interest, which was governed by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5069-1.05, &sect; 6(a) (1994), should have been added to actual damages before capping. Although the damage cap would have been unconstitutional under Texas's open courts guarantee if applied to the patient's common law personal injury claim, it was not unconstitutional as applied to the estate's survival claim. Surveyors' Medicaid inspection reports were properly admitted to prove substandard care and to impeach.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's statutory reductions of the jury's compensatory and exemplary damage awards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sheriff sought review of the decision of the 188th Judicial District Court (Texas), which issued a temporary injunction that directed him not to rely on an attorney general's opinion to support any attempt to prosecute appellee company for having a particular type of video machine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee company owned and operated video machines. Appellee filed a petition seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against appellant sheriff to prevent him from seizing or shutting down the machines based upon the authority of an attorney general's opinion, which suggested that appellee's machines were gambling devices. The trial court entered a temporary restraining order and restrained appellant from relying on the attorney general's opinion. The court reversed and held that the trial court avoided making an interpretation of the statute in question and circumvented addressing the application of the statute by simply ruling on the attorney general's opinion. The court found that the order that prohibited appellant from relying on the attorney general's opinion, without a showing that it conflicted with a judicial holding or had been declared unconstitutional, was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the temporary injunction that prohibited appellant sheriff from relying on an attorney general's opinion to prosecute appellee company. The court found that allowing the ruling to stand would have provided bad precedent for future cases, would have permitted the trial court to circumvent addressing the application of the statute at issue, and would not provide the relief sought by appellee.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellant did not have standing to challenge the ordinance under Tex. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged a decision from the County Court at Law No. 2 Tarrant County (Texas), that he was ineligible for a concealed handgun license because he pleaded guilty to a felony offense and was placed on probation, even though he was subsequently discharged from the probation and the charges were dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lower court determined that appellant was ineligible for a concealed handgun license because he pleaded guilty to a felony offense and was placed on probation, even though he was subsequently discharged from the probation and the charges were dismissed. On appeal, the court found that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4413(29ee) provided in general terms that a person who had served a felony probation was not eligible for a handgun license regardless of whether he was discharged from the probation. However, the statute did not address the situation where a defendant had been discharged from probation, his conviction had been set aside, and the indictment dismissed under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 7. Having considered the broad definitional provision of art. 4413(29ee), &sect; 1(4) and the more specific clemency provision of art. 42.12, &sect; 7, the in pari materia rule suggested that the latter controlled over the former. Because appellant did not have a prior felony conviction as that term was defined by art. 4413(29ee), he was eligible for a concealed handgun license. The court reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision below that disqualified appellant from obtaining a license to carry a concealed handgun because of his prior felony conviction, on the grounds that that conviction was set aside and dismissed. A clemency provision controlled over the definition of the term &quot;convicted&quot; found in the statute which would otherwise have disqualified appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Child was born during the marriage of appellant mother and appellant presumed father. Almost five years later, appellee filed a petition to establish his paternity. In response to appellee's petition, appellant mother moved to dismiss appellee's petition pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 160.110(f). The statute mandated dismissal of a paternity suit under certain conditions, including passage of a statute of limitations. The trial court rendered judgment declaring appellee to be the child's father. Appellant mother and presumed father sought review of the judgment. Appellee argued that appellants waived their right to rely on the statute of limitations contained in &sect; 160.110(f) by raising it in a motion to dismiss rather than in an answer. The court disagreed with that contention utilizing a rule of civil procedure. Appellee argued his paternity claim was not barred because it was filed less than two years after he was first told that appellant mother's son was his child. The court reversed the judgment in favor of appellee. The discovery rule did not apply to paternity actions. Appellee's paternity action was clearly barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury found against appellant television station and its reporter and in favor of appellee attorney and politician in a libel suit. The suit arose out of two television news broadcasts aired by appellants days before the run-off election for mayor of Houston between appellee and another.

The scheme involved one of appellee's clients who had reportedly drowned while sailing but was in fact still alive. On appeal, appellants asserted that the complained of statements were true or otherwise not actionable and there was no clear and convincing evidence of actual malice. The court found no clear and convincing evidence that appellants knowingly broadcast false statements about appellee. The corroborating evidence appellants uncovered was sufficiently probative to negate a jury finding of actual malice. Appellants' efforts to conceal the source of the story, although deceptive, did not constitute clear and convincing evidence that appellant reporter entertained serious doubts as to the truth of the broadcasts.

Water Code Ann. &sect; 49.231(a)(1) (1999) and 30 Tex. Admin. Code &sect; 293.141(a) (1997).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowner owned 40 acres of land. Appellee public entities imposed an annual standby fee on &quot;undeveloped property&quot; within appellee utility district's boundaries. Appellant's property was excused from the fees for three years pursuant to a negotiated settlement between appellant and appellee utility district. Appellee utility district applied to appellee Natural Resources Conservation Commission (commission) to impose standby fees on appellant's property. Appellant protested and an administrative law judge that appellee utility district receive the requested authority. The commission adopted the recommendation in a final order. Appellant brought suit in the trial court for judicial review of the order, an order which it affirmed in its judgment. The court looked to appellee commission's interpretation of the definitions of &quot;undeveloped property&quot; and &quot;available capacity&quot; under Tex. Water Code Ann. &sect; 49.231(a)(1) (1999) and 30 Tex. Admin. Code &sect; 293.141(a) and affirmed the trial court's judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A trial court sentenced petitioner to six months confinement, to run concurrently, for each failure to comply with his responsibilities under a divorce decree. The trial court further ordered that petitioner remain confined until he paid past child support, court costs, attorney's fees, uninsured medical expenses, and health insurance expenses. Petitioner sought habeas corpus relief, asserting that the contempt order impermissibly denied him the chance to earn good time credit, attached the specifics of the motion to enforce and the contempt order. The court held that petitioner was not denied the chance to earn good time credit because the trial court's sentence did not specify a particular release date. The court further held that it had no jurisdiction to grant relief from the civil contempts because no review was available until the criminal contempt sentence expired. The court also determined that even if it agreed on petitioner's points of error on the contested portions of the contempt finding, he would still be subject to the sentence on the uncontested portion, as the sentences were imposed to run concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner's request for habeas corpus relief from the trial court's order for criminal and civil contempt for petitioner's failure to comply with the provisions of his divorce decree was denied. The court determined that the trial court did not improperly deny petitioner the chance to earn good time credit, and the balance of petitioner's contentions were premature until expiration of the criminal contempt sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of an order of the 181st Judicial District Court of Randall County (Texas) that entered judgment, upon a jury verdict, convicting appellant of aggravated sexual assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was charged with the aggravated sexual assault of his nine-year-old daughter. At trial, the victim gave her testimony via closed circuit television, and appellant's attorney was not permitted to be in the same room with the child as she testified. After the jury returned a verdict of guilty and assessed punishment at 50 years of confinement, the trial court imposed sentence. Subsequently, appellant sought review. On review, the court affirmed because appellant's right to confrontation was not violated when the victim was allowed to testify without the presence of appellant's attorney in the room; there was no need for the trial court to make specific findings in the record before allowing the victim to testify by closed circuit television; having the victim testify from outside the courtroom without an explaining instruction to the jury did not deny appellant the presumption of innocence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order of conviction because the procedures used at trial that allowed the victim to testify by closed-circuit television did not violate appellant's right to confrontation; appellant was not harmed by the failure to specifically instruct the jury on the procedures; the record supported the decision to allow the closed-circuit testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of sexual assault and sentenced. The court affirmed the conviction and held that the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction because there was evidence that the victim's consent to sexual activity was not given and that appellant knew that her impairment was such that resistance was not reasonably expected. The court held that it was not improper for the trial court to allow the state to amend the indictment because the amended indictment alleged the same criminal offense as the original indictment, and appellant did not claim that he lacked notice to the extent that he was prevented from preparing a defense. The court held that appellant waived his right to assert error based on the grounds that Tex. Code Crim. P. art. 28.10 was unconstitutional in that it violated his constitutional right to be indicted by a grand jury because he failed to assert this in the trial court. However, the court held that appellant's indictment did not violate his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When appellant argued that the state made improper jury arguments, the court held that the arguments were permissible because they constituted proper pleas for law enforcement, and did not refer to the demands of the community. The court also held that counsel's trial strategy in failing to request a jury instruction on dependent personality disorder was not so deficient as to constitute ineffective representation by counsel, since the defense of dependent personality disorder was not well established. The court affirmed because Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 7.02 was not unconstitutional on its face and as applied to appellant because it required the state to show that appellant had both the mens rea to engage in a conspiracy and the culpable mental state to commit the underlying felony, and thus did not excuse the state from pleading and proving a culpable mental state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed appellant's conviction under statute allowing appellant to be convicted of a felony committed by a conspirator because the state was required to show that appellant had the mens rea to engage in a conspiracy and the culpable mental state to commit the underlying felony.</SPAN></P>

After appellant pled &quot;true&quot; to an enhancement paragraph in the indictment, the trial court assessed his punishment at forty-five years' confinement.

The court held that Tex.
