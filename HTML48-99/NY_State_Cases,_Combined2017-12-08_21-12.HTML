</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school brought a declaratory judgment action against defendants, a state university, the New York Commissioner of Education, and the Board of Regents, as to the validity of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3210. Pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect;&sect; 546-548, the parties submitted the controversy to the court upon their respective briefs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school was a private educational institution for girls, incorporated by a special act of the legislature. The school maintained a nursery school, a kindergarten, and an elementary school. The school did not receive any public funds and was not supported by any established religious group. The school refused to register with the New York Commissioner of Education as required by N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3210. The school alleged that the statute was not a proper and legitimate exercise of New York's police power and contravened U.S. Const. amend. IV, &sect;1 and New York Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court disagreed. The court held that the statute and the regulations established by the Board of Regents were a valid exercise of the state's police power. Because all schools were affected with a public interest, the state had the authority to regulate schools under its police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered judgment in favor of defendants, held that the regulations were valid and constitutional, and ordered that the school was enjoined and restrained from maintaining a nursery school, kindergarten, or elementary school until it registered in the manner required by New York statutes and regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">School - regulation - (1) contention of private school that Education Law (&sect; 3210, subd. 2, par. e) and regulations of Board of Regents which require it, as condition to maintenance of its nursery school, kindergarten and elementary school, to register with State Education Department are unconstitutional, overruled - (2) all schools affected with public interest and subject to reasonable regulation - (3) that private nursery schools not regulated prior to 1939 no reason for denial of State's power to do so now - (4) reasonable regulation not denial of rights - (5) State may legislate for welfare of immature children - (6) regulations as to schools' buildings, equipment, hours, etc., fall within legislative power - (7) assertion of State's interest in minimum standards no denial of rights; statute requiring registration of private nursery school and regulations enacted thereunder not beyond State's police power - (8) that no hearings had by Legislature before enactment of statute not fatal - (9) valid distinction between private and religious schools exists; no discrimination in statute against&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  private schools - (10) statute does not illegally delegate legislative power. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Upon submission of controversy a private educational institution contends that section 3210 (subd. 2, par. e) of the Education Law and regulations of the Board of Regents adopted pursuant thereto, requiring such an institution, as a condition to maintenance of its nursery school, kindergarten and elementary school, to register with the State Education Department, are unconstitutional.  Such contention is overruled and plaintiff is enjoined from maintaining such schools until registered in the manner required by the statute and the regulations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  All schools, public or private, are affected with a public interest and hence subject to reasonable regulation under the police power of the State. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  That the State had not entered the field of regulating private nursery schools and kindergartens prior to 1939, is not a sound reason for denying its power to do so now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Reasonable regulation is not a denial of the right of freedom of choice as to the education of children, or the right to teach subjects not immoral or clearly inimical to the existence of society. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  That the State, as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">parens</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> patrice</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of immature children may legislate for their safety, health, morals and general welfare, is not open to dispute. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  Regulations as to buildings, equipment, financial resources, safety appliances, sanitary conveniences, hours of study or training, and the like, all come within this general legislative power, and do not conflict with any basic rights guaranteed by either the Federal or State Constitution.  Moreover, the State may impose minimum scholastic and training standards, including qualifications for teachers, for both public and private nurseries, kindergartens and elementary schools. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  The State has a pre-eminent interest in minimum standards.  The assertion of this interest does not deny a choice of schools, or a reasonable choice as to training and curriculum. The statute requiring registration by private schools in the categories specified is not beyond the police power of the State, and the regulations promulgated thereunder are not arbitrary or unreasonable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8.  That the Legislature may have enacted the statute without legislative hearings or recorded debates is of no consequence.  The statute on its face bears the mark of a legitimate purpose, viz.: &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to legislate for the health, safety and general welfare of children. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9.  The Legislature was not required for regulatory purposes to cast both sectarian and nonsectarian schools in the same mold where, in fact, there is a distinction between such schools.  An act does not discriminate unconstitutionally against one class simply because it does not embrace all classes, where room for some distinction exists.  The Legislature may choose for regulation the class where harmful effects are more apt to exist. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10.  The statute does not illegally delegate legislative power. The power to lay out school districts, to approve plans for the erection of school buildings, to apportion public moneys and to withhold the same, to prescribe qualifications for teachers, curriculums and standards of training, are among some of the powers delegated. It would be impractical for the Legislature to cover by statutory enactment the detail and minutiae required for the adequate regulation of private schools or to attempt to set up standards that would necessarily involve the same details.  A reasonable amount of discretion may be delegated to administrative officials.  </SPAN></P>

The provision (Mental Health Law, &sect; 208, subd. 3) that such certification or sentence &quot;shall be deemed to be a judgment of the court in which the plea or verdict of guilty was entered&quot; did not contravene the constitutional limitation (N.

Such procedure is neither novel in practice nor prejudicial to defendant.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants were observed walking together and then separating, whereupon one of them approached a third party, showed him a piece of paper, flashed a roll of money and asked him for directions to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a hotel, telling him that, if he would show him where it was and accompany him there, he would make it &quot;worth his while&quot;.  When the person so accosted said that he did not know the hotel, the other defendant approached, was asked the same question and said he knew where the hotel was, whereupon both defendants walked away.  They were detained by a police officer who, after interviewing the person whom they had accosted, arrested them and found upon the person of each a &quot;Michigan roll&quot;, consisting of imitation money with a genuine dollar bill on the outside.  They were charged with fraudulent accosting under section 165.30 of the Penal Law, providing that a &quot;person is guilty of fraudulent accosting when he accosts a person in a public place and, either at that time and place or subsequently in any place, he makes statements to such person of a sort commonly made or used in the perpetration of a known type of confidence game&quot;.  At their trial, the arresting officer, who qualified as an expert, testified that they had been engaged in the &quot;handkerchief switch game&quot;.  Both were convicted.  The judgments of conviction are reversed and the complaint against them dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 165.30&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Revised Penal Law does not, on its face, require that there be a fraudulent purpose or intent and since it is not contained in the article defining larceny, cannot be read together with the provision of that article which requires intent for larceny. The standard to be applied is not set forth nor does it depend upon the understanding of a person of ordinary experience or intelligence, but, rather, it is implicit in the statute that an expert witness define the confidence game involved.  Thus, in the present case, although the actions of defendants in inquiring as to the hotel's location and possessing a &quot;Michigan roll&quot;, were not criminal per se, criminality was established by the expertise and observations of the officer, based on facts not made part of the crime by the statute itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It would be inconsistent with the plain language of the statute, which is clearly aimed at one who utters words, to hold that the playing of the confidence game had not proceeded sufficiently far to warrant the conviction of defendants.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A proceeding pursuant to sections 207 and 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law to commit an alleged addict is criminal in nature and the certification is the sentence imposed for the crime of which his guilt has been established and is deemed the judgment of conviction. However, the sole purpose of the commitment proceeding is to determine the sentence to be imposed.  Since the hearing is concerned only with this and not with guilt or innocence, a finding of addiction may properly be made upon a preponderance of the evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- loitering in or about school building -- defendant's free-speech right to distribute CORE leaflets, if constitutionally protected, was not abridged by applying to him Penal Law ( &sect; 722-b) prohibiting loitering in or about school buildings or school grounds -- since this defendant urges further on appeal that 60-day sentence was unjustified, his criminal record of narcotics and other convictions is considered; judgment affirmed -- but, as to another defendant, who may have stood 300 feet away from school grounds, judgment is reversed and new trial ordered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Penal Law ( &sect; 722-b), providing that a person &quot;who loiters in or about any school building or grounds without written permission * * * or in violation of posted rules or regulations * * * shall be guilty of disorderly conduct,&quot; was properly applied to a person who stationed himself on the sidewalk in front of a public&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  high school, near a sign which read &quot;No loitering. Persons found loitering in front of the building are subject to the charge of Disorderly Conduct&quot;, and who insisted on distributing to the crowd of students who were emerging from the building at that time handbills urging them to join CORE and to support a proposed bill which would establish a civilian board to review charges of improper police activities.  The constitutional right of free speech is not abridged by this application of the statute.  One of the principal purposes of the statute -- to help school authorities and police protect impressionable young people against distributors of narcotics, obscenity and other evils -- would be frustrated if they were unable to stop persons who appeared to bear handbills only, but who might also be carrying narcotics or other devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. This defendant also urges on this appeal that there was no justification for his sentence of 60 days in the city workhouse.  In this connection, his prior criminal record may be considered.  He has been convicted of narcotics violations three times, and once of disorderly conduct, and once of obstructing a police officer.  His record does not commend&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  him to appellate clemency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. However, as to another defendant, the judgment of conviction is reversed and fine remitted and new trial ordered. It is impossible to say, from the trial court's oral opinion, whether this defendant was convicted on testimony that he stood in front of the school building or on conflicting testimony that he stood on the street some 300 feet away from the school building. In the latter situation, he could not be said to be loitering in or about the school grounds.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- disorderly conduct -- meeting was held in area of heavy vehicular and pedestrian traffic to protest American involvement in Viet Nam; persons who used excessive force to resist proper police order to disperse were properly found guilty of disorderly conduct -- evidence of violation of any subdivision of section 722 of Penal Law will support conviction regardless of whether information charges one subdivision or another -- subdivision 3 of section 722 of Penal Law constitutionally applies to facts of this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An organization which was formed at Yale University to protest American involvement in the war in Viet Nam held a public meeting on a Saturday Summer afternoon in New York City in Duffy Square, which is a small island of concrete at the intersections of Broadway, Seventh Avenue, 46th Street and 47th Street. There was some evidence that this is a park and that the New York City Park Department Regulations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  require a permit for public meetings; however, such evidence, if any, was not relied on at the trial, and was not considered on this appeal.  Nor was there sufficient evidence that the police had banned public meetings on this island.  However, there was evidence that the meeting was attended by a group variously estimated as numbering 60 to 300 persons, that they were addressed by one defendant through a battery-powered megaphone, that the meeting interfered with pedestrian and vehicular traffic, that the police ordered the meeting dispersed shortly after it had opened, that the speaker refused to cease, that thereupon about a dozen policemen on foot and two mounted policemen forcibly dispersed the meeting, that a crowd of some 2,000 people was attracted by the commotion, and that the 17 defendants in this case actively resisted and interfered with the efforts of the police to disperse the meeting.  Judgments convicting the 17 defendants of disorderly conduct (Penal Law, &sect; 722, subds. 2, 3, 4) were affirmed by the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The duty of the police to regulate traffic and to prevent disorders and breaches of the peace in a congested vicinity justified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  their command that the meeting disperse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Even if the order that the meeting disperse was improper or unlawful, defendants' physical resistance to it was more forceful than necessary and hence was illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Evidence of a violation of any subdivision of section 722 of the Penal Law will support a conviction of disorderly conduct, regardless of whether the information charges one subdivision or another.  These convictions are valid under both subdivisions 2 and 3 of section 722.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Subdivision 3 of section 722 of the Penal Law, prohibiting congregating on a public street and refusing to move on when ordered by the police, validly and constitutionally applies to the facts of this case.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 11 defendants in this case picketed the site of a public housing project under construction, in order to protest against discrimination against Negroes by the building trades unions.  The Criminal Court of the City of New York found that several cement-mixing trucks were obstructed and halted, on the street and on an access road leading to a gate to the housing site, by some of the defendants who sat down in the path of the oncoming trucks and by others of the defendants who sat in front of the gate; that the defendants congregated on a public street, acted in a manner likely to produce violence, threatened the peace of the community, caused public consternation and alarm, and refused to move on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  when repeatedly requested by the police; and accordingly the court found the defendants guilty of disorderly conduct (Penal Law, &sect; 722, subds. 3, 4).

S. Const., 1st and 14th Amdts.).  The judgments of conviction were affirmed by the Appellate Term.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- disorderly conduct -- pickets, against racial discrimination allegedly practiced by construction contractors for State, crossed police barricade and lay down in path of truck and created clear and present danger of breach of peace; convictions of disorderly conduct (Penal Law, &sect; 722, subds. 2, 3) affirmed -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutionally</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> vague -- State does not aid or abet racial discrimination -- enforcement of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> against these defendants does not contravene their freedom of expression or deny due process or equal protection of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On the public thoroughfare in front of premises on which contractors were erecting a college for the State of New York, some 20 persons picketed, apparently peacefully, carrying placards protesting against racial discrimination allegedly practiced against Negroes in the constrution industry.  Eventually they crossed over a barricade which the police had erected at a gate to the premises, and they lay&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  down in, on and around the gateway and sidewalk and thus interfered with traffic and prevented a truck loaded with materials from entering the premises.  They were asked by the police, in vain, to leave the premises and to resume peaceful picketing on the sidewalk. Finally they were arrested and were properly charged with and found guilty of disorderly conduct under both subdivisions 2 and 3 of section 722 of the Penal Law. Said statute provides in part that &quot;Any person who with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned, commits any of the following acts shall be deemed to have committed the offense of disorderly conduct: * * * 2. Acts in such a manner as to annoy, disturb, interfere with, obstruct, or be offensive to others; 3. Congregates with others on a public street and refuses to move on when ordered by the police&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Beyond a reasonable doubt, defendants' acts presented a clear and present danger and likelihood of disorder and interference with traffic and breach of the peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The wording of section 722 (subds. 2, 3) of the Penal Law is not so vague as to make it impossible for a person of ordinary intelligence to know&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  what conduct has been made criminal and so as to make his prosecution under such a statute an unconstitutional denial of due process of law (U.  S. Const., 14th Amdt.; N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 6).  Furthermore, these defendants were charged with and were tried and convicted for violating both subdivisions 2 and 3, and not, as they seem to contend, for violating 2 &quot;or&quot; 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. After hearing testimony on this issue, the trial court properly found that the State of New York does not have any policy or practice of aiding or abetting racial discrimination if any practiced by its independent contractors, and that the State is not using section 722 of the Penal Law so as to deny to these defendants the equal protection of the laws.  (U. S.  Const., 14th Amdt.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. After hearing testimony on this issue, the trial court properly found that the enforcement against these defendants of section 722 of the Penal Law does not contravene defendants' rights of freedom of expression (U. S.  Const., 1st and 14th Amdts.; N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect;&sect; 8, 9).  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On the trial of a charge against defendant of sodomy as a misdemeanor, testimony of defendant's wife with respect to a natural marital relationship would neither prove nor disprove his ability or inclination to perform unnatural acts and was properly excluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant's guilt was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The conflicting testimony presented a question of credibility which was resolved by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A reasonable doubt precluding conviction is not established by the fact that one of three Judges presiding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at defendant's trial without a jury dissented from his conviction.  A majority decision is not unconstitutional.  Such 2 to 1 decision is not inconsistent with sections 428 and 430 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  The unanimity required under section 428 is by a jury, not by a constitutionally authorized court sitting in judgment without a jury.  A trial without jury as constitutionally authorized does not vitiate the presumption of innocence or the requirement that guilt be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The judgment of the court, albeit by two of the three members, will be arrived at in conformity with, and with respect for, the presumption of innocence and all rights which belong to the accused.  </SPAN></P>

The proceedings were dismissed on the ground that undesirability was an issue for the court under subdivision 6 of section 1410 of the Civil Practice Act. However, that statute applies to an existing tenancy either by lease or prolonged through rent control, not to one which has been terminated in a manner authorized by law.  The subject housing is not rent controlled and the landlord has the right to establish rules and procedures to terminate a lease for undesirability (Public Housing Law, &sect; 54).  The tenant may contest the fact that the authority has gone through the established procedures, but not the finding of undesirability.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant corporation executed and delivered to plaintiff a second mortgage on certain real property on October 16, 1954.  The individual defendants executed a collateral bond in the sum of $ 2,900 with 6% interest payable in monthly installments.  Twenty-two payments were made, leaving a balance of $ 1,119.32 which defendants refused to pay.  Instead of $ 2,900, approximately $ 2,000 was advanced to defendants at the time of the closing of the transaction.  An attorney and officer of plaintiff corporation stated that he told defendants that the loan would not be made at the rate of 6% and that they would be required to incorporate -- the purpose being to permit a greater interest rate than 6% -- and that he explained that title to their property would be conveyed to the corporation and the loan made to it secured by a second mortgage, and that they would be required to sign a collateral bond.  The president of defendant corporation stated that he did not know that a corporation was to be formed to take title to his one-family house.  Sufficient facts have been alleged by defendants to entitle them to a trial of the issue of fraud. If in fact defendants were&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  induced by fraud to transfer their property to the corporation, it might be sufficient to defeat the action for money loaned in the sum of $ 1,119.32 and upon the collateral bond.  Accordingly, a motion for summary judgment is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The transaction was not in violation of section 18 of the General Corporation Law and section 131 of the Banking Law. These statutes are not applicable to the discount of loans secured by mortgages on real property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 374 of the General Business Law, as amended by chapter 968 of the Laws of 1957, effective April 26, 1957, provides that no corporation may interpose the defense of usury in any action but that that provision &quot;shall not apply to a corporation, the principal asset of which shall be the ownership of a one or two family dwelling, where it appears either that the said corporation was organized and created, or that the controlling interest therein was acquired, within a period of six months prior to the execution, by said corporation of a bond or note evidencing indebtedness, and a mortgage creating a lien for said indebtedness on the said one or two family dwelling; provided, that as to any such bond, note or mortgage executed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by such a corporation and effective prior to April sixth, nineteen hundred fifty-six, the defense of usury may be interposed only in an action or proceeding instituted for the collection, enforcement or foreclosure of such note, bond or mortgage.&quot; That part of the quoted material beginning with the word &quot;provided&quot; was added by the Laws of 1957.  Chapter 968 of the Laws of 1957 is invalid insofar as it is retrospective in effect in providing that a corporation may plead usury as a defense to a contract which had a valid inception. It impairs the obligation of that contract and is invalid to such extent.  The agreement was not usurious when made and, since the agreement was valid in its inception, the Legislature could not constitutionally deprive plaintiff of all its rights therein.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- rent regulation -- removal of squatters -- (1) person occupying apartment with permission of statutory tenant after tenant quits apartment and who pays tenant substantial consideration for furniture in apartment is squatter -- (2) as to squatter, Administrative Code of City of New York (&sect; U41-7.0) does not require certificate of eviction -- (3) under Federal law no certificate of eviction needed to remove squatter; if conflict exists as to eviction provisions of Federal law and local law, Federal law takes precedence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A person who obtained possession of an apartment from a statutory tenant and who paid such statutory tenant a substantial consideration for furniture in the apartment is an intruder. In a statutory tenancy, the provisions of the lease cover the obligations of the parties unless in contravention of the statute.  Since tenant was obligated to surrender possession to landlord under the lease and his occupancy was that only&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which was continued by the statute upon the condition therein prescribed -- to pay the landlord the rent to which landlord was entitled -- the statute gave tenant no right to confer any privilege of occupancy upon a stranger by assignment.  The sale of tenant's furniture to such stranger with the intention of having the stranger continue in occupancy after tenant left is a subterfuge and evasion of the letter and purpose of the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section U41-7.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York contains no provision or definition bringing a squatter within the terms of the local law and does not require a certificate of eviction for anyone other than &quot;A tenant, subtenant, lessee, sublessee, or other persons entitled to the possession or to the use or occupancy of any apartment&quot; (subd. b, par. 5).  No evil of the emergency would be cured if a tenant, kept in possession against the will of landlord and about to remove, were permitted to substitute a stranger in his place as tenant. The emergency statutes were designed to protect tenant's occupancy. When tenant's occupancy ends, landlord is entitled to repossession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Under the Federal rent regulations a person in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  position of respondent herein may be removed without a certificate of eviction. If there is a seeming conflict between the eviction provisions of the Federal law and those of the local law, the Federal law having pre-empted the field of rent control takes precedence over the State or local law. The action of the State Legislature in enacting chapter 1 of the Laws of 1950 validating all provisions of the Local Laws of the City of New York relating to evictions and maximum rents cannot give force to a provision of a local law which is in conflict with the Federal statute controlling rents. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the State of New York and the Commissioner of Health, sought summary judgment on their action against defendant property owners for a permanent injunction restraining them from selling parcels of real estate out of a realty subdivision until a subdivision plan was filed with and approved by the New York State Department of Health and the appropriate district office. They also sought statutory penalties and to abate a public nuisance.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the State's motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of the property owners on the State's first three causes of action, holding that while the intent and thrust of both N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 1116 and N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 17-1505 were salutary and necessary, they were so vague and indefinite as to be beyond judicial construction to enforce the legislative intent. While there could be no quarrel with the legislative right to enact statutes establishing and regulating water or sewage disposal systems in realty subdivisions, such enactments were to be structured so that land owners were informed and advised as to what was required in order to protect the public's safety.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, a landowner within the Town of Black Brook, felt that its land development project, which was permissible under local law, was frustrated by the regulations and implementing action of the Adirondack Park Agency under the provisions of the Adirondack Park Agency Act (Executive Law, art 27), and brought an action seeking to declare certain sections of the act null and void.  Summary judgment is granted to defendants.  The act and the adoption pursuant to it of the Adirondack Park Land Use and Development Plan and Plan Map&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are, as a matter of law, lawful and proper in that they relate to matters other than the property, affairs or government of a local government, and are not in violation of article IX (&sect;&sect; 1, 2, subds [a], [b], par [1]) of the New York State Constitution or chapter 205 of the Laws of 1964 (Statute of Local Governments).

It follows then that the act did not require passage by the Legislature with approval of the Governor in two successive calendar years (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2, subd [b], par [1]).  The preservation of the unique qualities of the Adirondacks has long been the State's concern, and while area alone is not determinative, as against the limited bounds of the town, an area of six million acres is regulated by the act.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband challenged the fee application on several grounds. First, he alleged that the form of the wife's request for counsel fees was defective in that it did not contain a notice of motion setting forth a date for argument. The court held that the physical form of the papers submitted was not significant. Secondly, the court rejected the husband's argument that the motion was not timely under &sect; 438, because the trial court had discretion to hear the issue immediately after the final disposition. Thirdly, &sect; 438 was not discriminatory and unconstitutional, because it was reasonably related to the legitimate government interest. Without the power to award a needy wife counsel fees, her rights, in many cases, would not be adequately protected. Lastly, the court held that to deny counsel fees would be an abuse of discretion. After considering factors such as the time expended, the nature and difficulty of the problem, the results obtained, and the financial circumstances of the parties, the court awarded attorney fees to the wife.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner administrative judge filed a motion against respondent successful party for discovery under N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect;&sect; 3107, 3120 in an action to determine if the successful party's default judgment was obtained by fraud against the trial court pursuant to &sect; 217-a of the N.Y. Judiciary Law. The successful party filed a motion to dismiss the action. The attorney general filed a motion to intervene in the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrative judge filed an action to determine whether the successful party's default judgment was obtained by fraud against the trial court. The successful party claimed that the action was time-barred. The court ruled for the administrative judge because the one-year statute of limitations under N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 5015 did not apply to a court's power to examine its own judgments. Thus, &sect; 217-a of the N.Y. Judiciary Law was retroactive. Also, the fraud action was filed within the six-year statute of limitations under N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 213(9) from the discovery of the fraud. Where the action was transferred from the administrative judge to another judge, &sect; 217-a of the N.Y. Judiciary Law provided an impartial judge. The claim that &sect; 217-a failed to provide for a jury trial was irrelevant where no party requested a jury trial. The court allowed the attorney general to intervene. The court granted the administrative judge's motion for an oral examination under N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 3107 but denied the motion for discovery and production of documents under N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 3120 without prejudice unless it was needed after the oral examination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the successful party's motion to dismiss but granted the attorney general's motion to intervene in the action to determine if the successful party's default judgment was obtained by fraud against the trial court. The court granted the administrative judge's motion for an oral examination but denied the motion for additional discovery and production of documents without prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- inherent power over judgments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 217-a of the Judiciary Law creates no new grounds for vacating and setting aside default judgments beyond those grounds embraced by the concept of the inherent and unlimited power of the courts over their own proceedings.  The section merely codifies an illustrative, but incomplete, list of recognized, valid grounds upon which a court may modify or set aside its judgments, establishing orderly procedures to represent the public interest. Accordingly, the retroactive application of section 217-a to actions commenced prior to its effective date involves no exercise of power greater than that already possessed, and retroactive application is necessary to effect the legislative intent to discover abuses of court processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. No Statute of Limitations applies to the court in an action under section 217-a of the Judiciary Law, since courts are not subject to time limitations and none would be appropriate where a wrong involves an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  injustice in the use of the court's own processes.  The unlimited grounds for exercise of the court's powers over its own proceedings may not be limited in time.  If any existing limitation might be considered applicable, it would be the six-year limitation for an action based upon fraud, which runs from discovery of the fraud, and the subject proceeding would be timely thereunder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The one-year period under CPLR 5015 within which a default judgment may be vacated is inapplicable to the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The disposition of a proceeding under section 217-a of the Judiciary Law is determined by an impartial Judge solely on the basis of the doing of substantial justice, and there is, accordingly, no deprivation of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Oral examination under CPLR 3107 should precede discovery under CPLR 3120 in order to elicit information upon which the right to discovery may be intelligently adjudicated. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an effort to aid the City of New York during its financial crisis at a time&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of grave public emergency, the Legislature enacted the New York State Emergency Moratorium Act for the City of New York (L 1975, ch 874).  This act imposes a three-year moratorium on the enforcement of outstanding city notes all of which are short term obligations so as to avoid destructive actions while the city regains its financial health.  The Moratorium Act does not violate section 10 of article I of the United States Constitution by impairing contracts between the city and its noteholders. The States have a duty to prevent the literal enforcement of contractual terms in order to protect the health, safety or welfare of their citizens.  Therefore, in the public interest the economic interests of the State should be given priority over strict compliance with the contract clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Moratorium Act does not violate sections 2, 10 and 12 of article VIII of the New York State Constitution by a refusal to adhere to the restrictions therein on borrowing and securing the city notes.  The act provides for the ultimate payment of interest and full principal without relieving the city from its pledge of &quot;faith and credit&quot;.  The city is obligated to collect and allocate revenues within&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  constitutional priorities.  Although the city is not restricted in relation to its taxing power, the realistic limitations of this power were recognized by the Legislature which passed the Moratorium Act as an emergency measure so that the city could fully meet its obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 2 of article VIII of the State Constitution is not violated with respect to the limited time of two years following the initial indebtedness for redemption of city notes.  This clause is not applicable to city short term notes.  Assuming that it does apply, the Moratorium Act would be sufficient to extend the maturity date of the indebtedness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Moratorium Act is not in conflict with subdivision (i) of section 83 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act (US Code, tit 11, &sect; 403, subd [i]) which provides that no State law which prescribes a method of composition of indebtedness of municipalities should be binding on nonconsenting creditors.  The Moratorium Act permits an extension of indebtedness so as to allow the city time to pay in full.  It is not a composition plan empowering the city to discharge, cancel or force surrender of the notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Moratorium Act does not violate the Equal Protection&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution because it applies to city notes and not to city bonds.  There are distinctions between notes and bonds.  Since the city has a problem in meeting its short term note obligations of over $ 3 billion while it is capable of meeting its long term indebtedness, a moratorium has been imposed on notes and not on bonds.  This cannot be considered a constitutional violation of equal rights since both noteholders and bondholders have the right to be paid in full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A declaration of unconstitutionality of the act would be inequitable.  The public would face the unpredictable but costly results of default leading to financial disaster for the city while the noteholders would lose interest and a substantial portion of their principal.  Strict adherence to legalistic concepts is far outweighted by the equities in favor of constitutionality.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a city treasurer, filed an action against defendant gas company, seeking a declaration that the gas company's franchise of 1884 was invalid and that the relationship with the city was governed by the city charter of 1907, which required a 25 year limit to franchises and payment by the gas company of 2 1/2 percent of its gross income. The gas company filed a counterclaim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city treasurer sought a declaration that a lack of definiteness existed as to the beginning and terminating date of the franchise of 1884. The court disagreed, finding that no termination date was added to the franchise at its creation. The court held that in the absence of any conditions as to length of the duration of the rights granted, the conclusion was inescapable that the rights granted should be exercised in perpetuity and by successors to the original franchise. The city treasurer also claimed that the expressed conditions upon which the purported franchise was given were no longer maintained by the gas company. The court found that the city treasurer failed to allege a single factual violation of any express or implied condition of the grant of 1884. On the contrary, his own amended complaint alleged that the gas company maintained pipes and apparatus for delivery of its product to customers in the city. Finally, as to the city charter and its requirement of a 25 year limit on franchises, the court held that the charter was prospective in nature and did not apply to the agreement between the city and the gas company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the city treasurer's complaint and the gas company's counterclaim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- gas franchises -- franchise granted in 1884 is valid and governs defendant's relationship with plaintiff -- franchise of 1884 is not void for lack of definiteness as to commencement and termination dates; rights granted should be exercised in perpetuity -- no time limit as to duration of franchise can be found by implication -- defendant has not violated any express or implied condition of franchise grant; fact that Public Service Commission controls rates for utilities does not invalidate underlying franchise -- franchise is not governed by 25-year limit imposed on franchises by title XXIX of North Tonawanda City Charter; charter provision applies prospectively -- geographic limits of original franchise are not restricted to small part of present city -- since charter provision not applied retrospectively, 2 1/2% gross income rate set forth in title XXIX is not applicable to defendant; accordingly, defendant is not liable for money judgment and plaintiff's complaint is dismissed -- since title XXIX is inapplicable, defense of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> of Limitations and question of constitutionally are not relevant -- plaintiff is entitled</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> to have its rights in context of this fact situation determined by court of law; therefore doctrine of estoppel is not relevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In 1884 a franchise was granted to a predecessor of defendant by the Village of North Tonawanda for the furnishing of gas and gas services to its residents.  This franchise grant was expanded in 1895 to include an area which is now the City of North Tonawanda.  In 1888 a similar franchise was granted to another predecessor. The City of North Tonawanda succeeded in 1897 to the liabilities of the village, and defendant became a successor to the original franchises. Title XXIX of the City Charter of North Tonawanda was enacted in 1907 to govern franchise grants.  No franchise has ever been granted to defendant or its predecessors under this provision.  The franchise of 1884 is not void for lack of definiteness as to commencement and termination dates.  In the absence of any conditions as to length of the duration of the rights granted, these rights should be exercised in perpetuity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. No time limit as to the duration of the franchise can be found by implication.  Since the franchise gives no express time limit as to duration, its existence is perpetual. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Accordingly, it cannot be implied that the franchise is effective for a reasonable time, which time has now expired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant has not voided the franchise by violating any express or implied condition of the franchise grant.  Since the inception of the franchise in 1884 there has been an unbroken chain of performance and proper legal succession to the original franchise. Defendant has not charged more than the rate set forth in the original franchise grant and the fact that the Public Service Commission controls rates for utilities in this State does not invalidate the underlying franchise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The franchise is not governed by the 25-year limit imposed on franchises by title XXIX of the charter. This charter provision applies prospectively. The words &quot;shall be&quot; indicate a legislative intent for prospective application and no reference is made to any franchises previously granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Although the City of North Tonawanda's boundaries have expanded greatly since permission was granted in 1884 by the village, the geographic limits of the original franchise are not restricted to a small part of the present city.  The franchise was amended in 1895 by the village to include what&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are now the limits of the city.  Furthermore, in 1897 the city became liable for all the liabilities of the village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The 2 1/2 gross income rate set forth in title XXIX for the sale of gas and services in the City of North Tonawanda is not applicable to defendant since this charter provision is not to be retrospectively applied to the relationship between the parties.  Furthermore, a franchise creates a contractual right which is constitutionally protected from subsequent impairment by a municipal authority.  Accordingly, since defendant's relationship with plaintiff is governed by the franchise of 1884, which is valid, defendant is not liable for a money judgment and plaintiff's complaint is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Since title XXIX of the charter does not control the legal relationship between the parties, neither the defense of Statute of Limitations nor the question of constitutionality is relevant to the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Plaintiff is entitled to have its rights in the context of this fact situation determined by a court of law, and therefore the doctrine of estoppel is not relevant.  Accordingly, defendant's counterclaim, predicated on its rights being adversely affected, is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subcontractor entered into a construction contract that included an express waiver of its mechanic's lien rights. An alleged breach of contract led the subcontract to file a notice of lien. Thereafter, the legislature enacted N.Y.

The subcontractor sought to enforce the lien, and the contractors filed a partial summary judgment motion relying on the waiver. The court denied the motion, holding that &sect; 34 applied retroactively to prevent enforcement of the waiver. Such application of &sect; 34 did not constitute impairment of contractual rights in violation of U.S. Const. art.

Law &sect; 805-a(1) prohibiting the solicitation or acceptance of a gift with a value greater than $ 25 by a municipal officer or employee, contended that &sect; 805-a(1) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who were municipal officials, contended that &sect; 805-a(1) was unconstitutional and violative of the Due Process Clause of the Constitutions of the United States and the State of New York in that it failed to adequately set a standard by which reasonable men could reach a determination as to what were circumstances in which a gift was intended to influence the in their capacity as municipal officials and that the statute was unduly vague and unspecific. The prosecution maintained that the statute was not unduly vague in that the exercise of common sense could guide an individual in identifying the nature of the prohibited conduct. The court held that the language of the second prohibition in &sect; 805-a(1) left too much to the discretion of police or enforcement officials to determine criminality. The court was disturbed by the fact that the intent of the donor of the gift, not the intent of the municipal official accepting it, was controlling. The court found these deficiencies serious and violative of the equal protection of the law. The court, concluding that the two prohibitions in &sect; 805-a(1) were severable, retained the first prohibition and severed the second.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants were indicted for violating subdivision 1 of section 805-a of the General Municipal Law, which in general prohibits municipal officers or employees from soliciting any gift or accepting or receiving any gift having a value of $ 25 or more under circumstances in which it could be inferred that the gift&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was intended to influence him in the performance of his official duties. On defendants' motion to dismiss on the grounds that the statute is unconstitutionally vague, the first part of the statute is upheld.  The statute is severable and prohibits two separate and distinct types of conduct: soliciting a gift of any value under all circumstances, and accepting or receiving any gift of $ 25 or more, even if unsolicited, in any form, under circumstances intended or expected to influence the official in his official duties. Under the first prohibition, a municipal officer or employee is forbidden to &quot;directly or indirectly, solicit any gift&quot;.  This particular prohibition and language is clear, definite and unequivocal, so much so that no rational argument can be levied against its intent and meaning, and is therefore declared to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Under the second prohibition, a municipal officer or employee is forbidden to accept or receive any gift having a value of $ 25 or more, in any form, &quot;under circumstances in which it could reasonably be inferred that the gift was intended to influence him, or could reasonably be expected to influence him&quot;.  Such language is vague and without&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any standard or guidelines whatsoever, and accordingly, is unconstitutional as violative of the due process and equal protection clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions.  The wording does not set forth any commonly accepted or understood circumstance or set of circumstances under which it can be reasonably inferred that a gift is intended to influence or could reasonably be expected to influence an official in the performance of his duties or was intended as a reward for any official action on his part.  Nor does it contain any standard or guidelines by which such a determination may be ascertained.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff driver sought review of the denial of his application for a general preference and filed a motion for leave to reargue the denial alleging jurisdictional problems because defendant tortfeasor was a non-resident of the county to which the court transferred his action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver filed suit against the tortfeasor for injuries he and his family sustained in a car accident with the tortfeasor. The court denied the driver's application for a general preference and directed the transfer of the action to county court. The driver filed a motion for leave to reargue and alleged jurisdictional problems because the tortfeasor was a non-resident of the country to which the action was transferred. The court granted the driver's motion leave to reargue and denied his motion for a general preference. The court found that the general preference rule, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. Tit. 22, &sect; 674.1, which allowed the court to transfer tort cases to county court where the possible recovery was under a certain dollar amount was constitutional. The court held that the courts had the inherent power to control their own calendars. The court also held that the rule did not violate due process because the driver never had a vested right that was taken away.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- denial of general preference -- since plaintiffs in automobile negligence case failed to convince Dutchess County Supreme Court that they could recover in excess of $ 10,000 on each separate cause of action, application for general preference is denied; absent nonmonetary jurisdictional questions, test for general preference is whether claims asserted could result in recovery in excess of lower court's monetary jurisdiction -- general preference rule of Second Department (22 NYCRR 674.1) does not deprive plaintiffs of due process or violate their right to have damages assessed by jury -- fact that Dutchess County (Ninth Judicial District) does not have rule in regard to varying of monetary limitations upon transfers down does not violate equal protection -- where jurisdictional problems cause actions to be heard in Supreme Court that would otherwise be heard in County Court, policy in Ninth Judicial District is to conditionally deny general preferences provided defendant agrees to waive jurisdictional objections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After an automobile accident in which personal injuries were allegedly sustained, a husband and wife instituted an action against defendant in Dutchess&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  County Supreme Court.  Thereafter another action was brought on behalf of their two infant children and in the father's own behalf, and the actions were ordered consolidated.  In addition to a demand for a jury trial, the complaints alleged five causes of action wherein the wife sought $ 50,000, the children sought $ 25,000 each, and the husband sought a total of $ 36,500 (two causes of action for loss of services, one for property damage).  Demands for special damages of approximately $ 4,000 were incorporated in both complaints.  While permanent injuries were claimed for the wife and children, medical records and doctors' letters did not support those claims.  A note of issue and statement of readiness were filed and an application for a general preference was made.  The application for a general preference was denied and the action was ordered transferred to the Dutchess County Court upon the expiration of 90 days unless plaintiffs renewed the application.  Upon plaintiffs' motion to reargue, the application for a general preference is again denied.  However, if defendant does not consent to the transfer to County Court and agree not to assert in personam jurisdictional objections, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the application will be granted.  Plaintiffs failed to convince the court that they could recover in excess of $ 10,000 on each of the separate causes of action. While the Second Department rule for determining a general preference is 22 NYCRR 674.1, absent nonmonetary jurisdictional questions, the test is whether the claims asserted could result in a recovery in excess of a lower court's monetary jurisdiction, and case law holds this to be peculiarly within the court's discretion.  No medical affidavits were offered to support the claimed injury to the infants, and the letters submitted in support of the wife's claims establish an insignificant injury and apparent recovery.  The total amount of special damages ($ 4,263), absent a severe permanent injury (pain and suffering), indicates these claims are well within the $ 10,000 monetary jurisdiction of the Dutchess County Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The general preference rule of the Second Department (22 NYCRR 674.1) does not deprive plaintiffs of due process or violate their right to have damages assessed by a jury.  There is no taking of &quot;property&quot; within the meaning of the due process clause (i.e., potential maximum recovery reduced) because plaintiffs&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  never had a vested right in the inchoate prayers for relief to obtain the amount demanded.  Nor is there any &quot;access&quot; problem as plaintiffs have the County Court available, where they will receive a jury trial. The screening technique is merely a determination as a matter of law of a facet of their causes of action, a matter solely within the discretion of the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While CPLR 325 (subd [d]) gives the Appellate Divisions authority to vary monetary limitations on transfers on a county by county basis, the fact that Dutchess County (Ninth Judicial District) has no such rule does not violate equal protection. The no-transfer rule is premised on the congested state of the civil calendars in the lower courts, and this is reasonable and constitutes a valid basis for the monetary distinctions extant in various counties.  Jurisdiction has not been renounced, rather the court has exercised restraint and in its discretion, transferred cases to a more appropriate forum, which can be removed back to Supreme Court upon a proper showing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. While nonresident individuals of Dutchess County are not subject to jurisdiction of the Dutchess County Court, plaintiffs can commence their actions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Supreme Court based on nonmonetary jurisdictional considerations.  However, it is the policy in the Ninth Judicial District to conditionally deny general preferences provided defendant agrees to waive in personam jurisdictional objections upon the transfer to County Court.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For years, the Commissioner supplied the lists of exam applicants to the exam review company, which used the list for solicitation of the applicants to take its approved review course preparatory to the examination.

The Commissioner filed a motion to dismiss the petition, which the court granted. The court held that N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 88, subd.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public officers -- public's right to know -- lists of test applicants -- since Freedom of Information Law (Public Officers Law, art 6) defines in subdivision 3 of section 88 what is meant by &quot;unwarranted invasion of personal privacy&quot; to include release of names and addresses in possession of any agency if they would be used for commercial purposes, Commissioner of Education is prohibited from supplying lists of applicants for State Certified Public Accountant's examination to business that gives approved review courses -- neither State nor agencies may be estopped by acts done in prior years; it cannot be said that commissioner's decision to refuse to supply lists was arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Prior to the enactment of the Freedom of Information Law (Public Officers Law, art 6), respondent supplied petitioner with lists of applicants for the State Certified Public Accountant's examination, so that petitioner had up-to-date lists of applicants available for solicitation to take petitioner's approved review course preparatory to the examination.  Subdivision 3 of section 88 of the Public Officers Law provides that, in the absence of guidelines&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the Committee on Public Access to Records, an agency may delete identifying details to prevent an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Upon a petition to compel respondent to continue his former practice, or to allow petitioner access to respondent's records so that petitioner might itself compile the lists for use in its business, the petition is dismissed.  Subdivision 3 of section 88 defines what is meant by &quot;an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy&quot; to include in paragraph d &quot;the sale or release of names and addresses in the possession of any agency or municipality if such lists of names would be used for private, commercial or fund raising purposes&quot;.  The commercial character of petitioner's business brings it within the statutory exception and thereby prohibits respondent from further compliance with his practice of supplying the lists.  Lists of applicants for examination purposes specifically are an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That such was a long-standing practice before the enactment is irrelevant since neither the State nor its agencies may be estopped by acts done in prior years.  Nor may paragraph d be said to be unconstitutional.  The heavy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  burden imposed to reach that result has not been met by petitioner because it cannot be said that respondent's decision to refuse to supply the lists was arbitrary.  </SPAN></P>

Upon defendant's motion to suppress the visual observations of the special patrolman, as well as all testimony and physical evidence derived therefrom, the motion is granted.  The protection afforded by the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures depends on an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy. Persons using fitting rooms have an expectation of privacy, since the function of such rooms is to provide a place where a customer can try on items of clothing in private, undisturbed from the observation of others.  The surreptitious spying on shoppers as they undress and try on various garments infringes on people's reasonable expectation of privacy and is unconstitutional.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2. While the Fourth Amendment does not apply to acts undertaken by private persons, a special patrolman must be considered an agent of the government.  Special patrolmen in New York City are licensed by the city, appointed by the police commissioner, and possess powers beyond those of an ordinary citizen.  (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 434a-7.0.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The special patrolman did not have probable cause to search based on her observation of the codefendant placing a scarf in her knapsack, which she removed when approached by a sales clerk. At most, defendants' conduct was suspicious and equivocal which, without more, did not justify a search.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the administrator had the authority to do so and that he had taken into account the proper factors in arriving at the first rents. The N.Y. Priv. Hous. Fin. Law was not unconstitutional. It resulted in better housing, even if the tenants could not afford it. That was a legislative decision.

Under section Y51-5.0 (subd g, par 1, cl [m]) of the Administrative Code of the City of New York and section 33.9 of the Rent and Eviction Regulations, respondent Rent Commissioner is vested with authority to increase rents in rent-controlled buildings &quot;where he finds that there has been a rehabilitation or improvement of substandard or deteriorated housing accommodations which has been financed under a governmental program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance or tax abatement&quot;.  The new rent schedules, developed and tested in an adversary proceeding before respondent Rent Commissioner, where the tenants and their lawyers were heard and their views considered, have a factual and rational basis and should not be disturbed.  Although petitioners are suffering acute economic distress, the court is without power to overrule the judgment of the Legislature permitting a landlord to borrow public tax funds to improve his private property and then pass on the increases to tenants notwithstanding the fact that the &quot;beneficiaries&quot; of the law, which was intended to enable tenants of limited means to live in better housing &quot;without exorbitant increases&quot; in their rents, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are now compelled to pay large increases in rent, whether they can afford to do so or not.  </SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the charge. The effect of Rule 3(b) was directed at obstructions to navigation and was an attempt to maintain navigable passageways. The effects of Rule 3(b) could not be to reproach a landowner from fortifying a boundary on a navigable body of water or a waterway. While a riparian owner who sought to improve his property had to do so without obstructing the navigability of a waterway, the owner was entitled to build some form of protection to establish his boundary or to prevent the loss of soil by erosion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner driver sought review by a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding of an order of respondent Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles of the State of New York, revoking his driving license for failure to submit to a chemical breath test. He also sought an order granting him the right to apply for a conditional driver's license under N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law art. 21.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He refused a chemical breath test. The Department held a hearing to determine whether the driver's license should be revoked for failing to take the test. The arresting officer testified but the driver declined to testify, asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege. The criminal case was still pending and the hearing officer denied the driver's request to adjourn the hearing until the conclusion of the criminal trial. The court held that it could not review the revocation. The driver was required to appeal the determination through the administrative process first. The decision to refuse the driver's request for a stay pending appeal was based upon sufficient evidence, namely the testimony of the arresting officer. The court could not grant the driver's request for a conditional license because he had not first asked for it from the administrative agency. The court determined that the statutes providing for the conditional license did not violate the driver's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the driver's petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor vehicles -- revocation of licenses -- administrative appeals -- alcohol and drug rehabilitation program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On the basis of petitioner's refusal to submit to a chemical breath test following his arrest on a charge of driving while intoxicated, to which he entered a plea of guilty in now pending criminal proceedings, his license was revoked, and he filed an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Board, requesting a stay of the order of revocation pending the determination of the appeal, which request was denied.  The order of revocation is not now subject to judicial review in an article 78 proceeding, since it falls within the scope of section 263 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, providing that such a determination is not reviewable by any court unless an administrative appeal has been filed and determined.  However, the board's refusal to grant him a stay is, under that section, final and subject to judicial review, restricted to the issue of whether or not the board's action had a reasonable or plausible basis.  The record of the hearing held here contains evidence adequate to sustain the determination, the validity of which is not affected&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by his refusal to testify, since that was not the basis for the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since petitioner has not applied for, or been refused, a conditional license under article 21 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, which permits persons convicted of alcohol and drug related traffic offenses to obtain such a license during a license revocation period if they participate in a rehabilitation program, he cannot challenge the constitutionality of that article in an article 78 proceeding.  Treating the proceeding as an action for a declaratory judgment, the article does not deny him equal protection by denying him a conditional license while permitting persons convicted of more serious offenses to obtain such licenses. The right to a conditional license under the article is not an incident of conviction for an alcohol or drug related traffic offense, but a privilege which emanates from full participation in the rehabilitation program, and to limit participation therein to persons with alcohol or drug problems, which petitioner denies having, is reasonable.  Moreover, even if the article were unconstitutional, the court would have authority to declare it void, but no authority to include within its&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  scope a class of persons excluded by the Legislature.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder. At the time the crime was committed, Code Crim.

The court denied the motion. The factual setting in the instant proceeding did not present an analogous situation to the constitutional infirmity found in &sect; 720.10(2) because defendant was not only charged, but also was convicted under a statute, which provided ineligibility for youthful offender treatment. It could not be held that the exclusion from youthful offender treatment for the crime of intentional murder was arbitrary, capricious, or irrational.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was in prison serving a sentence on manslaughter and robbery convictions, filed a motion to dismiss a three-and-one-half-year-old second indictment for robbery stemming from the same incident. Defendant contended that he was denied his constitutional and statutory rights to a speedy trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 30.20, and N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district attorney contended that the word &quot;appeals&quot; in the tolling statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 30.30(4)(a), meant that during the time defendant appealed his homicide conviction, the People were not required to proceed in the robbery case. The court rejected the district attorney's claim on the basis that his interpretation of the statute would render it unconstitutional. The court held that the word &quot;appeals&quot; referred to appeals from pre-conviction proceedings and motions and not appeals from a judgment of conviction in an unrelated case. The district attorney also contended that defendant waived his right to a speedy trial by consenting to various adjournments. Defense counsel argued that the adjournments were consented to because the prosecuting attorney said that if the murder case was affirmed on appeal he would dismiss the robbery case. The court held that there was no speedy trial waiver by meaningful consent of defendant because the statutory and constitutional rights to a speedy trial would not be deemed to have been waived on &quot;good faith misunderstandings&quot; informally conducted outside of the court record, while defendant was in the state's prison.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- right to speedy trial -- multiple indictments -- where defendant had two indictments pending, one of which resulted in conviction and sentencing in December of 1973, with affirmance by Appellate Division in June of 1975, motion to dismiss second untried indictment is granted on grounds of denial of speedy trial rights; word &quot;appeals&quot; in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPL 30.30</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (subd 4, par [a]), which allows delay resulting from appeals to be excluded from time in which People must be ready for trial, refers to appeals from preconviction proceedings and motions, not appeals from judgment of conviction in unrelated case -- defendant's speedy trial rights are not deemed to have been waived on &quot;good faith misunderstandings&quot; informally conducted outside of court record, while defendant was in prison -- controversy should and could have been avoided by using proper procedures, which are outlined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In 1972 defendant had two indictments pending against him, one charging murder and robbery, the second charged robbery and other crimes.  The murder indictment went to trial and defendant was convicted and sentenced on December 3, 1973. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On June 26, 1975 the conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Division.  Upon a motion by defendant to dismiss the indictment charging robbery and other crimes upon the ground that he has been denied his constitutional and statutory rights to a speedy trial, the motion is granted.  CPL 30.30 (subd 4, par [a]), which allows a reasonable period of delay resulting from appeals to be excluded from the time in which the People must be ready for trial, does not mean that the People were not required to proceed on the second indictment while defendant appealed his homicide conviction.  A rational interpretation of the word &quot;appeals&quot; in the statute, especially in light of statutory ( CPL 450.10, subd 1; 460.20) and constitutional rights to appeal to our higher courts, indicates that it refers to appeals from preconviction proceedings and motions and not appeals from a judgment of conviction in an unrelated case.  The District Attorney's interpretation of the statute would render it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant did not waive his speedy trial rights by consenting to adjournments. While an affidavit by defense counsel alleges that he only consented to adjournments because the prosecution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  promised to dismiss the second indictment if the Appellate Division affirmed the homicide, the District Attorney denies it.  Defendant's constitutional and statutory rights to a speedy trial are not deemed to have been waived by meaningful consent on &quot;good faith misunderstandings&quot; informally conducted outside of the court record, while he was in State prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The controversy could have been and should have been avoided.  When a defendant has been convicted on one charge and has another pending, the untried case should be put on the calendar at the time of sentence. If the untried indictment cannot be disposed of by plea, the District Attorney should announce his position as to whether he intends to try the undisposed-of case.  If he will try the case regardless of the outcome of an appeal, the prosecutor should ask the court for a trial date.  If the prosecutor decides he will not prosecute in the event of an affirmance, he should announce his position in open court in the presence of counsel and the defendant.  A consent under those (or other) circumstances to an adjournment should be expressed by defendant and his counsel in open court.  Finally, the court must acquiesce to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any arrangements which could result in prolonged delays.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and the housing corporation entered into an agreement for construction of a housing project. The agreement provided that the housing corporation would pay fees to the city related to the construction stages of the development pursuant to the Redevelopment Companies Law, chapter 845 (1942). Subsequently, the legislature modified the statutes to provide for fees for the audit, regulation, and general supervision of the management of the company pursuant to N.Y. Priv. Hous. Fin. Law &sect; 118. The city brought an action to collect a judgment for the unpaid fees for the period from 1962 to 1975. The court found in favor of the city. The court found that the housing corporation was incorporated pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Redevelopment Companies Law. As such, the court held it was always subject to change in the future by amendment of that law. Therefore, the court held that any amendment to the law, as long as such amendments were reasonable, was binding on the housing corporation. The court found that the portion of the fee arrears prior to October 1966, six years before the service of the summons and complaint, was time-barred by N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 213.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant is a housing corporation organized in 1953 pursuant to the then Redevelopment Companies Law (L 1942, ch 845).  In 1963 the Redevelopment Companies Law was repealed and most of its provisions with some modifications were reenacted as the Private Housing Finance Law. Although the predecessor statute only provided for payment of fees to plaintiff City of New York relating to the construction stages of development (L 1942, ch 845, &sect; 19, as amd), defendant must nonetheless pay fees to plaintiff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  city for the &quot;audit, regulation and general supervision of the management of the company&quot; ( Private Housing Finance Law, &sect; 118).

Law art. 15-A, &sect; 555, to condemn real property owned by respondent landowner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner's property was adjacent to a parcel owned by the developer to whom the agency sought to sell the landowner's tract. The landowner asserted that the taking of his property was really for a private purpose to benefit the developer and that the developer would be unjustly enriched at the expense of the landowner. The court disagreed and granted the agency's application to condemn the landowner's property. The court noted first that its review was limited to whether the taking was for a public purpose because the question of the necessity of a taking was strictly a legislative not a judicial determination. Next, the court determined that the agency's purpose of the taking was to redevelop the area for industrial use and that such purpose was a public one. The court noted that the fact that the condemned property was to be sold to a private entity to effectuate the redevelopment did not destroy the public use purpose for which the condemnation was sought. The court also found that the landowner's due process complaint regarding the agency's failure to solicit bids for the project was collateral to the condemnation proceeding and, therefore, not properly before the court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Zausmer's objection to the condemnation on the ground that the authority by its announced intent of selling the property to the developer without giving him (Zausmer) an opportunity to bid for the land and its proposed development denied him equal protection of the law, is collateral to the issues on an application for condemnation, and is improperly raised.

The court held that: (1) the law was not an undue burden on the commerce clause; (2) to the extent that the law required those engaged in transfer operations to obtain permits upon payment of a fee, the law was a licensing or regulatory measure but the apparent purpose of the transfer charges was the accumulation of revenue; and (3) if the trial court found that the revenue aspects of the law constituted a regulatory measure, it would have to resolve the fact issues relative to the rationality of the basis for the classification in the law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Oil Spillage Ordinance of the Town of Huntington (Huntington Town Code, ch 60, &sect; 60-30 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, regulating coastal operations involving transfer of oil, does not impose an undue burden upon interstate commerce, is not inconsistent with the Federal Water Quality Improvement Act (US Code, tit 33, &sect; 1151 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and does not impermissibly infringe upon Federal admiralty jurisdiction (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Askew v American Waterways Operators</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 411 U.S. 325; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Portland Pipe Line Corp. v Environmental Improvement Comm</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 307 A2d 1 [Me], app dsmd 414 U.S. 1035). A prior motion for summary judgment made by plaintiff oil corporation, which operates a waterfront oil distribution terminal in the town, to declare the law invalid was denied on the ground that a fact issue existed as to whether plaintiff's operation was within the purview of interstate commerce (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Mobil Oil Corp. v Town of Huntington</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 72 Misc 2d 530). The oil spillage law prohibits the transfer of liquid fuel or oil in excess of 600 gallons for the purpose of storage or use without a permit issued by the town oil spillage control board.  Granting of a transfer permit having an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  annual fee of $ 100 is predicated upon the installation of safety equipment.  The $ 100,000 fund to be used to prevent spills and to clean up those which do occur is financed by imposition of a fee of one mill for every five gallons of fuel transferred by the operators of the three waterfront terminals in the town.  No provision is made for either ascertaining the cause of the spills or requiring the polluter to remove the spill or make restitution for the cost thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The spillage law does not constitute a prohibited impost on imports and exports. The transfer charges imposed are not taxes on the imports themselves but on activity relative to their importation.  The overall effect of the law is the lawful establishment of a regulatory scheme for controlling oil pollution.  The town's authority to enact a law affecting the transfer of oil from vessels upon navigable water to waterfront terminal facilities has not been preempted by the State ( ECL 17-1101).  The certificate of the Town Attorney appended to the law is presumptive evidence, unrebutted by plaintiff, that proper proceedings have been had or taken for the enactment of a local law (Municipal Home Rule Law, &sect; 27, subd&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiff's action to declare the spillage law invalid cannot be entirely dismissed.  A fact issue remains as to whether the law is an unlawful revenue-raising measure.  The $ 100 transfer permit fee is a licensing or regulatory measure which is a proper exercise of the town's police power. However, when the sums collected through a licensing or regulatory measure exceed the cost of administration, it may be deemed a revenue act which may not be imposed without an express delegation of authority from the Legislature.  Since the apparent purpose of the transfer charges is the accumulation of revenue to be used to remove oil spills no matter what the source of their creation, defendant town, at the trial, will have the onerous task of going forward with further facts which demonstrate that the fees are regulatory in nature and do not constitute an unauthorized tax levy.  In addition, a fact issue exists with respect to whether the classification inherent in the spillage law, applicable to only those terminals in the town, has a rational basis.  </SPAN></P>

It imposed a sentence of three to six years imprisonment as a second felony offender. Defendant, pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law ch. 783 (1975), filed a renewed motion to set aside the sentence.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, based upon his possession of a substance with an aggregate weight of one-eighth ounce and more containing methadone, and sentenced in March of 1974 as a second felony offender. In 1975, the Penal Law was amended so that the acts for which defendant was convicted, if&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  they had occurred after the amendments, would then constitute criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree (L 1975, ch 785).  If the acts had occurred prior to the amendment but defendant had not yet been convicted or sentenced, he still would have the benefit of the ameliorating sentencing provisions (L 1975, ch 786).  However, in the case of a defendant already sentenced, the 1975 legislation (L 1975, ch 783) provides only for the resentence of those persons convicted of class A felonies and fails to provide for the resentencing of persons convicted of the class C felony based upon aggregate weight.  Thus, if literally applied, a defendant convicted of the C felony solely because he possessed less than one ounce would be ineligible for resentence. Defendant's motion for resentence pursuant to chapter 783 of the Laws of 1975 is granted and he is deemed convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree.  The failure to provide for the resentencing of persons convicted of a class C felony based upon aggregate weight is an inadvertent oversight since it was the clear intention of the Legislature to impose the new weight standards&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  across the boards to all methadone cases.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3101(f), plaintiff claimants sought an order directing defendant insureds to divulge the liability insurance coverage available to satisfy part or all of any judgment which might have been entered.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insureds objected to the claimants' demand to disclose their liability insurance coverage on the grounds that pretrial proceedings had not been completed, but the court held that parties who permitted the contingent filing of notes of issue did so at their own risk. In addressing the insureds' argument that N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3101(f) did not speak in terms of any corporate entity issuing the insurance, the court found the argument contrary to N.Y. Gen. Constr. Law &sect; 37, which provided that the term &quot;person&quot; included a corporation. Further, disclosure of the insurance policy limits was not likely to lead to amendment of the complaint's ad damnum clause because such amendment could only be granted where the claimants showed that the damages they suffered, which were previously unknown, supported an increased demand. The court held that the likelihood of settlement was greater if the policy limits were disclosed prior to the trial, and that Rule 3101(f) was not unconstitutional because there was no confidential relationship recognized by law between an insured and his carrier.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The depositor claimed that the subpoena duces tecum violated his constitutional rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The court held that the depositor did have standing to challenge the subpoena duces tecum because the depositor was the party in interest and had a limited expectation of privacy in his bank records and the court should have provided a forum for depositors to challenge third-party process on constitutional grounds. The court determined that a showing of probable cause was not essential as long as valid legal process had been issued. The court held that the subpoena duces tecum was far too sweeping in its scope. The court determined that only the records that were directly relevant to the inquiry were available to the grand jury. Finally, the court held that there was no Fifth Amendment violation because the Fifth Amendment privilege adhered to the person and not to the documents, and there was no First Amendment violation because the government interest in obtaining all relevant testimony before the grand jury outweighed the depositor's reliance on his First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner, a target of a criminal investigation of the nursing home industry, as the real party interest, has standing under CPLR 2304 to contest the validity of a subpoena duces tecum properly issued by the Special Prosecutor for Nursing Homes and served upon respondent bank requiring production of all records relating to petitioner's business account, which he operates as a sole proprietorship, &quot;including but not limited to signature cards, corporate resolutions if any, monthly statements, deposit slips, reproduced checks, loan applications, debit and credit memos.&quot; Petitioner, as a depositor, has a limited expectation of privacy in the information he discloses to his bank as a result of transacting business in his account.  Courts should provide a forum for depositors to challenge third-party process on constitutional grounds.  Banks cannot be expected to resist a subpoena by placing themselves in contempt, and compliance by the third-party bank&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would clearly frustrate any judicial determination of the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner's motion to quash the subpoena is denied since the Special Prosecutor is authorized under subdivision 3 of section 63 of the Executive Law to issue process on behalf of the New York County Grand Jury presently investigating Medicaid fraud and abuses.  A valid Grand Jury subpoena is the proper means by which the government may obtain access to bank records of petitioner's account.  A showing of probable cause is not essential as long as valid legal process has been issued.  However, the subpoena is modified so as to limit its application only to the production of those records which reflect transactions with nursing homes, related businesses or individuals.  The Special Prosecutor is unauthorized to open a full-scale investigation of the personal affairs of anyone who has ever dealt with a nursing home in this State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioner's personal and business records in the hands of his bank are not protected under the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self incrimination.  It is the bank, not petitioner, which is the party compelled by subpoena. There is no special circumstance between petitioner and his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  bank which would be protected by the Fifth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioner is not entitled to transactional immunity under CPL 190.40 (subd 2) with respect to the evidence revealed by the records produced under the subpoena. Petitioner, while a target, is not a &quot;witness&quot; before the Grand Jury, nor is he giving any evidence for which immunity may be conferred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Compliance with the Grand Jury subpoena would not have a chilling effect upon petitioner's First Amendment rights to freedom of religious, political and personal associations.  The subpoena is limited to only those items involving transactions with nursing homes and related businesses.  Invasion of areas protected by the First Amendment is therefore unlikely.  The paramount government interest in obtaining all relevant testimony before the Grand Jury outweighs petitioner's reliance on First Amendment rights.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The only witness before the grand jury was an undercover police officer who testified to one conversation with defendant, 11 months earlier, during which defendant allegedly offered and agreed to sell heroin to the officer. The officer testified, without elaboration, that the actual sale did not occur and he never saw defendant again. The question was whether that evidence of a naked offer or agreement was sufficient to hold defendant upon an indictment charging sale. The court noted that if a mere offer was sufficient to bring a defendant within the definition of &quot;sale,&quot; then there would be no need to prove the nature of the substance transferred. Indeed, if the mere offer was sufficient to establish sale, then the introduction of drugs in evidence together with identifying testimony could be dispensed with in every case where a transfer was preceded by negotiation and agreement. The court, therefore, held that where the gravamen of the offense was an offer or agreement, the people were required to establish a specific intent to transfer the drug which was the subject of such offer or agreement. The slight evidence was legally insufficient to support the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Before the Grand Jury, the only witness was an undercover police officer who testified to a single conversation with defendant, 11 months earlier, during which defendant allegedly offered and agreed to sell heroin to the officer.  The officer also stated that the actual sale did not occur and that he never saw defendant after the conversation. Thereafter, defendant was indicted for the Class&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A felony of criminal sale of a dangerous drug in the first degree.  Although the statutes then in force (Penal Law, &sect; 220.00, subd 5; &sect; 220.44) seem on their face to proscribe the mere knowing utterance of words constituting an offer or agreement, evidence of a naked offer or agreement is insufficient to hold defendant upon an indictment charging sale.  Where the gravamen of the offense is an offer or agreement, the People must establish a specific intent to transfer the drug which is the subject of such offer or agreement.  However, there are some factual situations where the People may establish intent without being able to point to any identifiable substance as the subject of the offer or agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In the context of the officer's inconclusive testimony and the absence of any showing of other conduct by the defendant which would indicate an ability or attempt to obtain and deliver the drugs, the slight evidence is legally insufficient to support the indictment.

The matter was before the court to determine the proper application of the 1975 amendments to N.Y. Fam. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a delinquency proceeding, petitioner sought respondent's pretrial detention for 14 days on the basis of alleged acts constituting first degree rape, N.Y.

Probable cause to believe in respondent's guilt was established under the standards controlling a criminal court preliminary hearing on a felony complaint. Good cause for postponement of the trial was shown, in that petitioner had been unable to comply with respondent's request for the minutes of the alleged victim's testimony for use at trial. The victim's testimony at the probable cause hearing was deemed to be her testimony for trial purposes, with an opportunity for additional direct testimony and for respondent to cross-examine her de novo. The rules of evidence applicable in a fact-finding governed in the probable cause hearing, respondent's rights were not violated by the procedure used at the probable cause hearing, and the judge who presided over the probable cause hearing was not disqualified from conducting the trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The putative unadjudicated father of the minor children brought a proceeding for visitation. The natural mother opposed the petition. The parties were never married. The father was listed on the birth certificates of both children as their father. The mother contended that the father should have been nonsuited as being without remedy in the court. The mother argued that visitation could only be awarded to a putative father in paternity proceedings under article 5 of the Family Act, proceedings which the statute provided could only be commenced by the natural mother against a putative father and not vice versa. The mother further claimed that, even if custody was awardable in proceedings brought by a putative father against a natural mother by writ of habeas corpus, the father was entitled to bring such proceedings only in the supreme court. The court held that it could act upon and entertain a petition solely seeking visitation.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

Laws 868, &sect;&sect;22, 23, as amended by 1975 N.Y. Laws 870, which authorized appropriations as an advance to the City of New York for city purposes.

The court held that the provisions of the Act did not involve a gift or loan of credit of the State, nor did the State undertake to guarantee obligations of the City. Further, the court stated that moneys expended by the State to meet the emergency situations involving the welfare of its citizens did not constitute a dissipation of the State's credit; rather, those moneys were applied essentially for the State's own purposes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. To counter New York City's financial emergency, an Extraordinary Session of the Legislature appropriated 750 million dollars to be taken &quot;in the first instance from the local assistance fund&quot; as an advance to the City of New York, for its city purposes.  (L 1975, ch 868, &sect;&sect; 22, 23, as amd by L 1975, ch 870.) At the same time the State entered into a program of short-term borrowing to pay portions of the appropriations. The Laws of 1975 (ch 868, &sect;&sect; 22, 23, as amd by L 1975, ch 870) are constitutional and valid. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although section 8 of article VII of the State Constitution provides that the credit of the State shall not &quot;be given or loaned to or in aid of any individual, or public or private corporation&quot;, a clear distinction is made between gifts or loans of &quot;money&quot; to a public corporation, which are authorized, and gifts or loans of &quot;credit&quot; which are prohibited.  The use of short-term borrowing against revenues to obtain funds for transfer to the city involved a gift or loan of money and not of the credit of the State.  To hold otherwise would endanger all of the State's short-term borrowing, notwithstanding the specific authorizations of section 9 of article VII.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In enacting the emergency legislation, the Legislature expressly articulated facts which it regarded as establishing a situation of financial emergency both in the city and the State inasmuch as default &quot;would effectively force the city to stop operating as a viable governmental entity and create a clear and present danger to the health, safety and welfare of its inhabitants&quot; (L 1975, ch 868, &sect; 1).  The amelioration of a State financial crisis arising from the city's financial difficulties is a proper State purpose which justifies&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the State in borrowing money to meet what the Legislature regards as a State emergency. </SPAN></P>

She had also satisfied the court of her familiarity with the financial affairs of the decedent and of her investigation. The court, noting the Florida probate of the will, ruled that after a probate in another state, N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc. Act Law &sect; 1605 permitted the original probate of a will in New York only under exceptional circumstances. The court ruled that in accordance with N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father is the parent and guardian ad litem of a 24-year old child, who although never judicially declared incompetent, was receiving in-patient care at a private psychiatric hospital. The local agency denied the father's application for financial assistance for the private medical treatment for his son. After a hearing, respondent Commissioner of Orange County Social Services (commissioner) affirmed the denial. The father filed the instant N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding questioning the constitutionality of N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 360.21(e), and the statute upon which &sect; 360.21 was based, N.Y. Soc. Serv.

The court held that the age classification contained in &sect; 360.21 and &sect; 365(2) were unconstitutional. There was an invidious discrimination written into N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 365(2) because of its classification based on age and type of illness. The age classification denied the father's son the right to equal protection of the law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the entry of the police officer was an illegal invasion of the private room of defendant and an unconstitutional invasion of his privacy. The court found that the officer, in the guise of a porter, was invited by defendant into his hospital room for the purpose of permitting the officer, as a porter, to perform the necessary duties thereof. The officer, although unknown by defendant as such, but in the same manner as anyone else authorized and required to enter the room, might have accepted the invitation to enter for the very purposes contemplated by defendant. This did not constitute a breach of privacy nor did the pretense result in breach of privacy. During his visits to defendant's room, the officer neither saw nor heard anything other than what defendant exposed to him nor did the officer engage in any general search. The court held that any statements, acts, or conducts, which one exposed to the &quot;plain view&quot; of outsiders, were not protected because defendant did not exhibit any intention to keep them to himself.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting on information that defendant was carrying on illegal bookmaking and gambling activities in his private hospital room, an undercover State Police officer was assigned to the hospital with the consent of the hospital authorities and was given hospital duty as a porter. While in the room and in the presence of the defendant, the officer overheard the defendant taking bets over the phone and observed him making notes on slips of paper. The officer revealed his true identity, placed defendant under arrest and seized the gambling records.  Upon a motion to suppress the evidence seized on grounds that it was obtained as a result of an illegal search and seizure, the motion is denied.  The taking of bets and recording them, conducted in the presence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of an officer legally on the premises, constituted the commission of a crime in his presence, warranting him to immediately place the defendant under arrest and to seize contraband on the premises as an incident to the arrest. While Fourth Amendment protections extend to a man's private room in a hospital, defendant waived his right to privacy by submitting himself to a hospital where it was anticipated that porters would enter his room.  This consent was not vitiated by the fact that the porter was an undercover officer since neither precedent, public policy or logic bars the use of deception to gain peaceable entry into a private habitation.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the punishment imposed on a second-felony offender was not disproportionate, and the application of the second-felony offender statute did not comprise punishment of a status because defendant had control over such status; (2) application of the statute did not constitute an ex post facto application because the punishment inflicted was not greater than that affixed to the crime when it was committed; (3) the statute was not unreasonable and was rationally related to a legitimate state interest; and (4) double jeopardy did not apply because defendant's crimes were not the same in either law or fact.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was arrested for possession of an unloaded pistol. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since he had been previously convicted of a felony, he was indicted for criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, a class D felony (Penal Law, &sect; 265.02, subd [1]).  Using the same crime which elevates the charge against him to a felony as the basis for considering him a second-felony offender (Penal Law, &sect; 70.06), does not violate defendant's constitutional rights. Sentencing defendant as a second-felony offender would not constitute cruel and unusual punishment since when the gravity of the offense is taken into consideration, the maximum possible sentence he could receive, if convicted, is not so grossly disproportionate to the crime as to render it unconstitutional.  Nor does the predicate-felony statute punish a status since a defendant subject to its provisions has not been placed in a position he was powerless to change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Inasmuch as both the elevation of the crime from misdemeanor to felony and the application of the predicate-felony statute comes about as a relevant incident to a regulation of a present situation, the predicate-felony statute as applied here is not an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since both the weapons statute and the predicate-felony law as applied&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to defendant fulfill a clear legislative purpose, and the sentencing procedures are clear and equally applicable to each and every defendant convicted of this crime in this State, there is no denial of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The use of defendant's prior conviction in this manner does not constitute double jeopardy since the offense charged in the indictment is not the same in either fact or law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The contested procedure is not unconscionable, nor is it not in the interests of justice.  There is no reason to depart from the rationale of prior judicial decisions which have upheld this approach, especially in light of the current legislative concern with the problems of recidivism and gun control.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant filed an action pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 against respondents, Commissioner of the Schenectady County Department of Social Services (commissioner), state official, and utility company, seeking a judgment directing the commissioner to provide the claimant with an emergency grant to pay overdue utility bills.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant had been a recipient of state aid. When the claimant was automatically transferred to the federal supplemental security income (SSI) program, the claimant's utility bills were no longer paid. Fifteen months later the claimant received a bill from the utility company for past due amounts that indicated that the claimant's power would be shut of if the bill wasn't paid. When the commissioner rejected the claimant's application for emergency assistance, the claimant filed the instant action. The court rendered judgment in favor of the claimant and found that under N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 303(1)(a), the claimant's impending loss of utility services constituted an unforeseeable catastrophe that warranted emergency assistance. Considering that the claimant was never informed that his utility bill would no longer be paid and that there was no evidence that the utility company sent the claimant any bills before the cut off notice, it was clear that the claimant could not have foreseen the dilemma. Furthermore, compensation for this bureaucratic catastrophe, though not a natural disaster, was consistent with the spirit of &sect; 303(1)(a), which sought to fill the gaps left by SSI.</SPAN></P>

The county had not informed him that it would no longer be paying his utility bill after his transfer to the Federal program, nor is there any proof that the utility had sent him any bills before March, 1975, and, therefore, he could not have foreseen his present predicament. He is entitled to emergency assistance from the county, under section 303 (subd 1) of the Social Services Law, which directs social service officials to provide emergency assistance to eligible aged, blind and disabled persons who need replacement of necessities lost as a result of fire, flood or other similar catastrophe which could not have been foreseen by such person.</SPAN></P>

In view of the purposes and policy which the Legislature intended to promote by its enactment, and in view of the constitutional mandate that the State and its subdivisions are to care for the needy, and the statutory embodiments of that mandate, the aid provided for in section 303 (subd 1) cannot be limited to those who find themselves in need because of a natural catastrophe, but must also be made available to those who find themselves in need because of a bureaucratically engendered catastrophe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for murder under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.25 and asserted the affirmative defense, provided in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.25(1)(a), that he had acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse. Defendant then sought an order declaring the statutory defense unconstitutional because it necessitated his proving an element of a lesser offense. The trial court agreed and declared the affirmative defense portion of the statute invalid. It explained that the affirmative defense statute placed the evidentiary burden on defendant to establish his defense by a preponderance of evidence, as N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 25.00(2) required. Because N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.25(1)(a) shifted to defendant the burden of proving a fact critical to criminal culpability, the trial court found that it was defective and violated due process. However, to address the People's considerable burden in proving a negative state of mind, the trial court ordered defendant to serve a notice on the People containing a general statement of the &quot;extreme emotional disturbance&quot; that he claimed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the application to the extent that it found the affirmative defense portion of the murder statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 125.25 (subd 1, par [a]) of the Penal Law, which requires a defendant charged with murder to prove the affirmative defense that he &quot;acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance&quot; by a &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; (Penal Law, &sect; 25.00, subd 2) in order to reduce the crime of murder to manslaughter, violates due process by unconstitutionally shifting the burden of proving &quot;extreme emotional disturbance&quot; from the People to defendant (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Mullaney v Wilbur</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 421 U.S.  684). It is the duty of the State not defendant to bear the total burden&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in all criminal cases.  Therefore, a defendant has no duty to prove any defense by a preponderance of the evidence and to require him to do so violates due process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurant provided topless dancing as entertainment to its customers. It filed an action against the town, seeking a declaratory judgment that Town of Van Buren, N.Y., Ordinance (May 12, 1975), which banned topless entertainment in certain public places, was unconstitutional. The trial court agreed and invalidated the ordinance. It explained that, although the town claimed that the ordinance had not been intended to ban topless dancing, it was sufficiently broad to proscribe totally such performances in restaurants and bars. While the town could have drawn the ordinance more narrowly to control or prohibit certain undesirable actions by patrons or lewd and obscene performances by entertainers, it had not done so. Instead, the ordinance included within the area of its prohibition or control non-obscene performances or dances, which were a form of expression protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners were charged with a violation of the Code for having allegedly failed to register dwelling units that they owned as rental property. They moved to dismiss the charges, alleging the Code had been in general disuse for many years, there had been widespread and flagrant violations known to enforcement officials that remained unprosecuted, and prosecution against them was politically motivated; therefore, the action against them was discriminatory. In denying the motion, the court first noted that the evidence showed the Code had been enforced generally within the city, and that rental units had been registered in conjunction with the inspection thereof. Second, although in the past many properties had not been registered or inspected, there was no credible evidence that Code enforcement personnel had knowledge of specific premises in violation and had taken no action. Furthermore, the law did not require a fail-safe system of ascertaining all properties in violation as a condition precedent to the prosecution of any property owners. Finally, the property owners failed to offer any evidence that prosecution against them was politically motivated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants, charged with a violation of section 7.8 of the Housing, Property Maintenance and Rehabilitation Code of the City of Binghamton for having &quot;refused and failed to register dwelling units&quot; owned by each of them, as required by the code section, made a motion to dismiss on grounds of discriminatory enforcement. The motion is denied.  The statute has not been in general disuse for many years and any prosecution for failure to register&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">ipso facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> discriminatory. The distinction between &quot;registration&quot;, and inspection and issuance of a certificate for rental units is merely technical.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is no evidence to suggest that the prosecution was politically motivated.  It was not the failure to register alone that prompted the prosecution, but the failure to comply with a formal written request which allowed a sufficient and reasonable time for compliance.</SPAN></P>

Judgment by default was entered on April 30, 1970.  Petitioner currently owes the judgment creditor $ 564.85 with interest.  The Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act is not rendered unconstitutional solely by reason of the fact that petitioner may have failed to pay the judgment because of his indigency.

Since the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 330, subd [d]), permit petitioner to obtain a prompt stay of the suspension pending a complete hearing on the validity of the suspension, the constitutional requirements of due process have been met.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner judge and respondent banks each sought summary judgment on the judge's request to vacate all default judgments entered against debtors who were required to pay a percentage of their bad debts to the banks as liquidated attorney fees. The judge alleged that this practice constituted both the unauthorized practice of law and fee-splitting, under N.Y. Jud. Law &sect;&sect; 491 and 495, as well as usury under N.Y. Banking Law &sect;&sect; 108(4) and (5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Banks that were collecting on bad debts were also attempting to enforce contract provisions regarding attorney fees. The provisions allowed them to assess 15 percent of the unpaid balance of cash loans or overdraft loans, or 20 percent of the unpaid balance for credit card cash advances, as liquidated attorney fees, regardless of the fact that the banks used in-house counsel. The court held that such a practice constituted usury under N.Y. Banking Law &sect;&sect; 108(4)(c) and (5)(e) because the sums, if collected in full, would grossly over-reward the banks as unreasonable fees. The court noted that attorney fees could represented only actual services in a particular case. In addition, the court pointed out that N.Y. Pers. Prop. Law &sect; 413(5), enacted later, explicitly disallowed credit agreements from containing attorney fees provisions for salaried in-house counsel. Finally, the court agreed that the practice also constituted the unauthorized practice of law by the banks and fee-splitting with the attorneys, violations of N.Y. Jud.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the order of the banks' motion for summary judgment, and granted the judge's cross-motion for summary judgment, vacating the default judgments entered against the debtors for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Pursuant to provisions of the Banking Law ( &sect; 108, subd 4, par [c], cl [iii]; subd 5, par [e], cl [iii]), respondent Chemical Bank made different types of consumer loans, each of which had a form agreement containing a provision stating that in the event of default and suit to collect the unpaid amount, there would be an additional 15 or 20% of the unpaid balance added for attorney's fees, the percentage depending on the type of loan.  In 1973 the bank collected $ 70,752 in excess of what it collected in defaulted consumer obligations over what it paid its salaried in-house counsel, and in 1974 the figure was $ 37,795 plus, for each year, uncollected judgments for much more.  The excess was used for the bank's legal department's office overhead.  In a proceeding pursuant to section 217-a of the Judiciary Law to vacate the default judgments, petitioner's cross motion for summary judgment is granted.  The policy of section 108 of the Banking Law is that interest is to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  cover the general expense of lending money, with an exception to permit the collection of the actual necessary expenditures for processing a case including reasonable attorney's fees.  The bank's construction of the statute, that it may recover attorney's fees in each case although no actual attorney's fees were paid for the services rendered in that particular case, provided that it uses sums so collected towards defraying the expenses of its legal department, leads to unethical and illegal results.  By its practices, the bank has engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in violation of section 495 of the Judiciary Law. Further, the bank has engaged in conduct violative of section 491 of the Judiciary Law (sharing of compensation by attorneys prohibited) and has acted in concert with its salaried attorneys in fee splitting in violation of canon 3 and disciplinary rule 3-102 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The bank's printed uniform complaint stated that an additional percentage of the balance had become due and payable as attorney's fees, but in no case did the bank allege that it actually expended a particular sum in payment of an attorney's fee to process the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  papers in that particular case or furnish any proof that such fee was reasonable or necessary.  Therefore the bank engaged in a misrepresentation by setting forth in its complaints against consumer debtors a specific item of recovery as attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The bank routinely charged and recovered default judgments of 15 and 20% of the balance due, a rate so far in excess of what is reasonable as an attorney's fee for a default judgment that it can only be construed as a hidden charge to avoid the usury laws.  Therefore the bank engaged in usury by seeking to recover a charge in excess of the charges permitted by subdivisions 4 and 5 of section 108 of the Banking Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The bank's practice also leads to discriminatory and unequal results which would render the enabling statute unconstitutional.  By expressly stating in subdivision 5 of section 413 of the Personal Property Law that &quot;(t)he credit agreement may provide for the payment of attorney's fees * * * if it is referred to an attorney not a salaried employee of the seller or holder for collection&quot;, the 1957 Legislature clearly indicated what it understood the 1937 statute (Banking Law, &sect; 108, subds 4, 5) to mean, and more artfully&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  delineated the limitations upon the collection of attorney's fees in accordance with existing laws and ethical standards.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Housing and Development Administration of the City of New York (housing administration) and defendants, membership corporation of real property owners, and officers and members of its board of directors, filed various motions in response to the housing administration's action to enjoin defendants from a planned shutdown of boilers for maintenance purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The housing administration sought to enjoin defendants from a planned shutdown of boilers for maintenance purposes. Defendants agreed not to promote the shutdown. The court found that the proposed shutdown was organized by defendants to dramatize certain housing issues not directly related to boiler maintenance. Accordingly, the court held that the boiler shutdowns were illegal and a potential threat to the tenants' welfare, and the court permanently enjoined the shutdowns. The court dismissed various counterclaims filed by defendants. The court granted defendants' motion to amend to conform to the proof thereby raising constitutional questions about the rent control and rent stabilization laws. The court concluded that the rent control and rent stabilization laws had become unconstitutional as administered because they resulted in the deprivation of the owners' property without due process of law and denied the owners equal protection under the laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted a permanent injunction against defendants and granted the housing administration's motions to dismiss several counterclaims brought by defendants. The court also allowed defendants to plead the unconstitutional administration of the rent control and rent stabilization laws and found that the laws were unconstitutional as administered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- rent regulation -- constitutionality -- although rent control and rent stabilization laws were constitutional ab initio, they have now become </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> as administered, and are therefore declared unconstitutional; however, implementation of decision is stayed for 60 days to afford opportunity for presenting plan for administering laws so as to cure constitutional defects -- permanent injunction granted to enjoin defendants from planned shutdown of boilers for &quot;maintenance&quot; purposes -- defendants' motion to conform pleadings to plead </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> administration of rent control and rent stabilization laws is granted -- counterclaim seeking &quot;pass-along&quot; of increased fuel costs to tenants in rent-controlled apartments is denied since alleviation of that burden is primarily legislative matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding to enjoin defendants, a group primarily composed of owners of real property in New York City, from a planned shutdown of boilers for &quot;maintenance&quot; purposes, a permanent injunction is granted.  The tactic was organized by defendants to dramatize certain housing issues not directly related to boiler maintenance, is a potential threat to tenants' &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  welfare, and is legally impermissable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since access to the courts is meaningless if constitutional issues are prohibited to parties by the recognition of highly technical objections and the New York City Civil Court has jurisdiction to hear any defense to a cause of action or claim (CCA, &sect; 905), defendants' motion to conform the pleadings to plead the unconstitutional administration of the rent control and rent stabilization laws is granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although the rent control and rent stabilization laws were constitutional </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">ab initio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, they have now become unconstitutional as administered, and are declared unconstitutional. The evidence clearly establishes that the administration of these laws has resulted in wholesale deprivation of property without due process of law, as well as a denial of equal protection.  Procedures to protect property rights of both landlords and tenants as hardship applications and MBR (Maximum Base Rents) protests have become a mockery due to years of delay and total inaction in processing remedial applications.  A huge rent gap has led to a deterioration in housing units, causing total abandonment of valuable property, and the City of New York has been&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  deprived of some 600 million dollars in defaulted real estate taxes.  However, implementation of the decision insofar as it declares said laws to be unconstitutional is stayed for 60 days to afford an opportunity for presenting a plan for administering the laws so as to cure the constitutional defects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Although the court takes judicial notice of the fact that fuel costs have increased enormously in the previous 18 months and added a tremendous burden to already beleaguered property owners, alleviation of that burden is primarily a legislative matter, and therefore a counterclaim seeking a &quot;pass-along&quot; of increased fuel costs to tenants in rent-controlled apartments is denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the City Court of the City of Syracuse (New York), which entered judgment on a jury verdict convicting him of the crime of obscenity, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 235.05(1), and which sentenced him to pay a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of the crime of obscenity, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 235.05(1), which stemmed from the exhibition of an allegedly pornographic film in a local theater. Defendant was sentenced to pay a fine. Defendant appealed, and, upon review, the court reversed the judgment in the interest of justice and remitted the case to the city court for a new trial. The court held that the city court committed reversible error in its charge regarding the community standard of obscenity because the city court failed to define what &quot;community&quot; was meant. The court stated that by failing to define &quot;community&quot; to jury was allowed to define the term in accordance with its connotation as a local as opposed to a State-wide area. Thus, because there was neither a legal definition nor a factual showing as to the applicable community standard, the jury was confused, and defendant was entitled to be judged by a jury properly instructed as to the element of a contemporary State-wide community standard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment is reversed and a new trial granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- obscenity -- compulsion to preserve evidence -- community standards -- defendant was properly restrained by order to show cause from removing allegedly obscene film from jurisdiction, based upon judicial inquiry into probable cause -- compulsion to preserve film did not violate Fifth Amendment rights, since film is physical evidence and defendant was compelled to preserve rather than produce evidence -- failure to object at trial to court's instructions regarding community standards was not waiver of appeal rights, since case law thereon was not sufficiently evolved -- contemporary State-wide community standard should be applied retroactively on appeal -- court's mention of State-wide citizenship fails to comply sufficiently with case law and prosecution failed to offer evidence on applicable community standard -- accordingly, judgment of conviction should be reversed in interests of justice and case remitted for new trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The defendant was properly restrained by order to show cause from removing allegedly obscene film from the jurisdiction pending an adversary hearing. The order was signed only after judicial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  inquiry into probable cause to find the film obscene, based upon an affidavit of a police investigator who viewed the film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The defendant's Fifth Amendment rights were not violated by compulsion to preserve the film, since the film constituted physical rather than testimonial evidence and since the defendant was compelled to preserve rather than produce the evidence.  Accordingly, the film was properly admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The defendant's failure to object at trial to the court's instructions regarding the community standard by which the film was to be judged does not constitute a waiver of appeal of the issue, since case law thereon was not yet sufficiently evolved to support the defendant's present position, and the question may be reviewed under CPL 470.15 with a view to reversal in the interests of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A contemporary State-wide community standard should be applied to films and such standard should be applied retroactively on appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The trial court's mention of State-wide citizenship of the jury did not sufficiently comply with recent case law requiring full explanation and definition of the applicable community standard, and the prosecution offered no evidence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as to such standard.  Accordingly, the judgment of conviction should be reversed in the interests of justice and the case remitted to City Court for a new trial. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The male was a resident of New York and the female was resident of New Jersey. Section 13-b permitted a judge of the county in which the woman to be married resided to waive the 10-day waiting period. The court ruled that it could not be said that the residence of the female rather than of the male had any relationship, let alone a significant one, to the legislative intent of liberal granting of relief to prospective couples adversely affected by the statutory limitation on the natural and constitutional right to marry. A classification had to be reasonable, not arbitrary, and had to rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons in similar circumstances would be treated alike. The court ruled that the effect of &sect; 13-b denied the male the equal protection of the laws. The court further ruled that if a man and a woman were residents of New York or the woman was a resident of New York and the man was not, then the statutory provision was applicable. If, however, the man was a resident of New York and the woman was not, then a court in the county of the man's residence could waive the 10-day period.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners moved pursuant to section 13-b of the Domestic Relations Law for an order waiving the 10-day waiting period from the time blood specimens are taken until solemnization of the marriage.

Since the effect of the statute is to deny the male the equal protection of the laws, the motion is granted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted an ordinance that required the posting of the retail sale price of gasoline, kerosene, or diesel fuel. The ordinance was intended to prohibit fraudulent practices in the retail sale of gasoline. A county where the city was located also adopted a sign ordinance that made the requirements uniform through the county. Defendant operated a retail gasoline station in the city. As a station owner and an officer of a local gasoline dealer's association, he objected to the passage of the ordinance. The defendant sought arrest in order to test the validity of the ordinance. The court held that: (1) the ordinance was constitutional because there was no denial of due process or discrimination where the requirement that a sign be posted over every pump was not an arbitrary interference with defendant's property rights and did not violate the state or federal constitutions; and (2) the ordinance was a proper subject of the inherent police power of the city absent a showing of arbitrary action by a city council or that the ordinance did not bear any relation to the public welfare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in a five-count, consolidated indictment with the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and related crimes. On the date of trial, defendant filed a motion and sought to have the statutory imposition of a burden of proof upon him, should he raise an entrapment defense, declared unconstitutional. The matter was before the court following oral argument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant reserved his right to raise the affirmative defense of entrapment in his trial for the criminal sale of a controlled substance. He contended that the provisions of N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 25.00 and 40.05 violated his due process rights as guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment because they improperly imposed a burden of proof on him. The court noted that the affirmative defense was created by the statute, as well as the shifting of the burden of proof to defendant. It noted further that before the affirmative defense was presented to the jury for its consideration, the State was required to prove all the elements of the crime. It distinguished a Maine statute that had been declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court because it impermissibly shifted the burden of disproving the elements of a crime onto a defendant. The Maine statute required a defendant charged with murder to prove that he acted in the heat of passion on sudden provocation in order to reduce the homicide charge to manslaughter. The Maine statute at issue did not require the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to make entrapment an ordinary defense with the burden of disproving the same upon the People. It held the statute pertaining to the affirmative defense of entrapment and its shifting of the burden of proof was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- entrapment -- placing burden of proof upon defendant who raises entrapment defense (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Penal Law, &sect; 40.05</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) does not violate due process clause; defendant's motion to make affirmative defense of entrapment ordinary defense with burden of disproving same upon People is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon a trial for criminal sale of a controlled substance and related crimes, defendant's motion to make the affirmative defense of entrapment (Penal Law, &sect; 40.05) an ordinary defense with the burden of disproving the same upon the People is denied.  Placing the burden of proof upon a defendant who raises the entrapment defense does not violate the due process clause, and therefore section 40.05 of the Penal Law is constitutional.  This case is to be distinguished from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Mullaney v Wilbur</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (421 U.S. 684) where the Supreme Court examined a Maine statute which required a defendant charged with murder to prove that he acted in the heat of passion on sudden provocation in order to reduce the homicide to manslaughter, and found it unconstitutional.  Raising the entrapment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  issue in no way affects the prosecution's duty to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the crime charged, and the jury does not reach the entrapment question unless it finds defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of all the elements of the crime before them.  Also, the shift of the burden of proof does not increase the chances of an erroneous conviction.  Since the burden of proof of criminal sale of a controlled substance is left with the District Attorney, the entrapment defense does not increase the possibility that an innocent man will be convicted or that one guilty of a lesser crime will be sentenced as a more serious offender.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an arrestee, filed a motion that challenged the constitutionality of the civil arrest remedy provisions of N.Y.

He was arrested as a result of a motion for civil arrest as a provisional remedy filed by plaintiff, a joint venturer with the arrestee, in a commercial law claim for the collection of a debt allegedly owed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties formed a joint venture for the importation and distribution of brush handles and broomsticks. The joint venturer filed a civil suit against the arrestee for fraud and conversion and sought an accounting. He filed a motion for attachment of the arrestee's property in the state and claimed the arrestee was about to sell his house and move to another state, which would effectively avoid the state courts' jurisdiction. The court granted an attachment. That same day the joint venturer filed a notice to attach real property. Two days earlier the arrestee sold his house. The joint venturer moved for an arrest so the arrestee would be available to be sued civilly. The court ordered an arrest, set bail, and directed a sheriff to bring the arrestee in for a hearing mandated by N.Y. C.L.P.R. 6111. The court tentatively continued the arrest order but released the arrestee in the custody of his attorney. The court held that: (1) a clause of the civil arrest provision violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it subjected the arrestee as a man to arrest while it flatly exempted all women; and (2) it was not proven that the arrestee violated any order.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1 of CPLR 6101, which provides for civil arrest &quot;where there is a cause of action to recover damages for the conversion of personal property, or for fraud or deceit, and the person to be arrested is not a woman&quot;, is unconstitutionally discriminatory. The sex of a person has no rational relationship to the objectives of the statute, and no compelling State interest requires the sex distinction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action for damages for fraud and conversion, and also for an accounting, plaintiff moved to have defendant arrested, on the basis, not only of CPLR 6101 (subd 1), but subdivision 2 of CPLR 6101, which provides for civil arrest &quot;where the plaintiff has demanded and would be entitled to a judgment or order requiring the performance of an act the neglect or refusal to perform which would be punishable by the court as a contempt and where the defendant is not a resident of the state or is about to depart therefrom, by reason of which non-residence or departure there is a danger that such judgment or order will be rendered ineffectual&quot;.  In his affidavit in support of the motion, he had not claimed that defendant's arrest was necessary to protect the efficacy of an anticipated court order&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or to keep defendant within the court's coercive jurisdiction, but that defendant had already committed a contempt. However, there is no satisfactory proof of defendant's commission of a contempt, and, in any event, the proper remedy would have been to seek immediate punishment for it.  Civil arrest as a provisional remedy is essentially a security device, and should only be employed, if at all, when essential and appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While plaintiff's demand for an accounting could support a civil arrest order, since the failure to comply with a court-ordered accounting is an act ultimately punishable by the court as a contempt, his affidavit did not mention the accounting aspect of his case, nor does it show facts sufficient to establish his entitlement to an accounting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. While the constitutionality of subdivision 2 of CPLR 6101 need not be decided here, its desirability is questioned by the court.  </SPAN></P>

N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 341(g) provided credit for service in war after World War I, and therefore both Korean War and World War II veterans were eligible for credit under &sect; 341(g). In dismissing the petition, the court found that from a clear reading of the statutes involved, the legislature decided that World War II veterans were to be afforded extra service credits. The legislature did not exclude any war veterans from credit benefits, but merely provided World War II veterans with additional credit opportunities. The court presumed that the legislature investigated for and found facts necessary to support the legislation. The court noted that statutes conferring benefits or preferences on one group of veterans and not other groups had been consistently upheld by the courts.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A petition by Korean War veterans attacking the constitutionality of sections 302 and 341 (subd k) of the Retirement and Social Security Law, which provide additional service credit towards retirement benefits for those policemen and firemen who are World War II veterans, but not for those who are veterans of other wars, is dismissed.  It is to be presumed that the Legislature has investigated for and found facts necessary to support this legislation, and petitioners have not overcome the heavy burden upon one who attacks the constitutionality of a statute to establish its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with attempted murder and assault in the second degree and indicated that he proposed to plead the affirmative defense that he had acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance. The court on its own motion adjourned the trial date in order to consider the constitutionality of &sect; 125.25, which required defendant to affirmatively prove the defense, pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 25.00, by a preponderance of the evidence. The court evaluated a recent Supreme Court interpretation of a Maine statute and concluded that the portion of &sect; 125.25 that required defendant to prove the defense was unconstitutional. The Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause required the prosecution to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, the absence of the influence of extreme emotional disturbance when the issue was properly presented in the trial of an indictment. The prosecution was required to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged, and the reasonable doubt standard applied to the degree of an offense as well as to the fact of its commission. The invalid provision was struck from the statute but was not retroactive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, two finance companies, filed a motion for a declaratory judgment that the wage assignment statutes provided in N.Y. Pers. Prop. Law art. 3-A and N.Y. Banking Law art. 9 were not violative of the Fourteenth Amendment or N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. Defendants, two borrowers, opposed the motion and filed a cross-claim to dismiss the complaint. The New York Attorney General appeared and urged that the statutes were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The same parties were involved in a civil rights federal court action involving the issue of the constitutionality. Defendants in that action sought a judgment declaring the New York Wage Assignment statute to be unconstitutional as violative of the Fourteenth Amendment in respect to due process clause. A federal court declared the statute unconstitutional. On appeal, a federal appellate court reversed and held that plaintiffs' action in filing the assignments with defendants' employers was a private action, and not State action, to which the due process clause would be inapplicable. As to defendants' motion to dismiss, the court held that there still existed a judicable controversy based upon the stipulation between the parties to stay the execution of the wage assignment pending the completion of the litigation. As to the merits, the court held that there was state involvement in the wage assignment field. The court concluded that there was no Federal question involved because the federal appellate court unequivocally found no State action. The court, however, found that the statutes in question did not violate the New York State Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A Federal court action involving the same parties resulted in a refusal to review the issue of due process, based upon a finding that the State was not actively involved in wage assignment agreements between lenders and borrowers and, therefore, there was no State action to which the due process clause of the United States&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Constitution would be applicable.  This ends State court inquiry in respect to any Federal question.  However, on the basis of findings made by the court in the present declaratory judgment action, including a finding that the Legislature has involved the State in the wage assignment field and, during the pendency of the Federal litigation, enacted amendments to the statutes assuring due process for the borrower, it is adjudged that the statutes also comply with the United States Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, New York Housing Authority (authority), sought review of a decision of respondent, Commissioner of Environmental Conservation Department (commissioner), which found that the Authority's property was subject to the Tidal Wetlands Act (act), N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authority sought to sell land to a private developer that it had acquired through a condemnation by the city. The authority requested the commissioner to determine whether the land was subject to the act. The commissioner determined that it was. The authority applied for a moratorium permit to allow alterations otherwise prohibited by the act, and the commissioner only allowed alterations to a portion of the property. The private developer withdrew its offer to purchase and the authority filed an action. The court denied the commissioner's motion to dismiss and held that the sale of land to a private developer did not, on its face, further the ends of the authority, under N.Y. Pub. Hous. Law &sect; 2. The court held that moratoriums would be upheld as valid and not a taking of property so long as they were for a reasonable purpose and of a reasonable duration. The court held that &sect; 25-0602 was constitutional on its face and as applied to the authority, and therefore, did not sanction a taking of property without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Environmental conservation -- Tidal Wetlands Act -- New York City Housing Authority is not agency of State and, therefore, property acquired by it through condemnation is not exempt from provisions of Tidal Wetlands Act -- intention of act is to establish comprehensive system of land-use regulations after inventory of all tidal wetlands, and, since regulations have not yet been promulgated, any challenge to constitutionality of act as a whole is premature -- moratorium provided for in act, prohibiting any person from altering state of any tidal wetland prior to effective date of land-use regulations, except by special permission, is reasonable and, up to now, has been of reasonable duration -- article 78 proceeding, attacking applicability of act to property acquired by New York City Housing Authority through condemnation and also constitutionality of act is treated as action for declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York City Housing Authority is not an agency of the State, and, therefore, property acquired by it through condemnation is not exempt from the provisions of the Tidal Wetlands Act ( ECL art 25), section 25-0602 of which exempts from the provisions of the act &quot;any lands&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  now or hereafter appropriated by the state or any agency or department thereof under the power of eminent domain&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The intention of the Tidal Wetlands Act is to establish a comprehensive system of land-use regulations after an inventory of all tidal wetlands. Since the regulations have not yet been promulgated, any challenge to the constitutionality of the act as a whole is premature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 25-0202 of the Tidal Wetlands Act provides for a moratorium, prohibiting any person from altering the state of any tidal wetland prior to the effective date of the land-use regulations, except by special permission from the commissioner.  Such moratoriums have been upheld as valid and not involving an unconstitutional taking of property so long as they are for a reasonable purpose and of a reasonable duration. The subject one is reasonable, since alteration of property while the inventory required for formulation of the land-use regulations is in progress may irreparably damage wetlands, and thereby render the regulation academic before it is even effectuated.  Nor may it be said that it has, up to now, run for an unreasonable period of time.  It has been in effect for slightly less&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  than two years, and the inventory is feasible only during the summer growing season, when the wetlands can be identified.  Moreover, the act contemplates public hearings and conferences with local government officials, prudent measures considering the many interests which may be affected by the regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The present proceeding was initiated by the New York City Housing Authority as one under CPLR article 78, but, since it attacks the applicability of the Tidal Wetlands Act to property acquired by the authority through condemnation and also the constitutionality of the act, thus attacking the commissioner's very power to act and not merely the propriety of his action, it is treated as an action for a declaratory judgment. </SPAN></P>

There were signs posted restricting the admission into this section of the bookstore to persons over the age of 21. Defendant raised the defense provided by N.Y.

In order to sustain the constitutionality of the statute, the court read the affirmative defense afforded under &sect; 235.15(1) as authorizing sales to all adults and not a limited few.

He was then arrested based on the officers' opinions that defendant was intoxicated. An alcotector test later revealed that defendant was intoxicated under legal standards. The jury found defendant guilty under &sect; 1192(2). In his motion to dismiss, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The court, in dismissing the motion and rejecting defendant's arguments, held that the section under which defendant was found guilty was not a separate new crime as contended. The court held that each subsection under the statute differed only in the manner of proof of intoxication. Subdivision two of &sect; 1192 required that the State show, by the results of a chemical test administered within two hours of an arrest, that the defendant had greater than .10 of one per centum of alcohol in his blood. The end result of all the subsections of the statute would be the same, a conviction for driving while intoxicated. The court noted that some additional proof was necessary that defendant had greater than the minimum quantity of alcohol in his bloodstream at the time of driving.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with misdemeanor conspiracy, misdemeanor possession of stolen property, and possession of a handgun. Defendant filed a motion to suppress arguing that the evidence was discovered by way of an unlawful search and seizure and that the search warrant was constitutionally invalid. Defendant also filed a motion to dismiss the indictments pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 210.20 on the grounds that prosecution of defendant would constitute an injustice because of the gross impropriety of the undercover detective. The court agreed and granted the motions. The court held that the infiltration of defendant's community, without any cause or guidelines whatever for a two-year period, with daily and indiscriminate spying on a multitude of citizens and community groups, was an unconstitutional invasion of privacy. The court held that the unfair police tactics posed a real and serious threat to civilized notions of justice and that the sweeping, free-wheeling, penetrating, and extremely protracted infiltration of the entire community presented a different situation from that in which an undercover officer infiltrated a conspiracy of international drug dealers.</SPAN></P>

There was no basis under the search warrant for seizure of four out of five items, there being no reason whatsoever to believe that the property was stolen, and the evidence presented in support of the warrant is too conflicting, weak and incredible to accept.  The warrant application was submitted one day after a previous application was rejected for staleness, although it was stated that no prior application had been made, and the evidence was found in the place specified by the earlier application while the basis for the information was as stale as in the earlier application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, a county board of assessors, filed motions to dismiss the proceedings brought by petitioners, property taxpayers, and strike the testimony of an expert witness and to strike state equalization rates as applied to the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state adopted equalization rates for its counties to establish a just relationship between the valuation of all tax districts within a county. The phase of the action concerned the methodology used by a state board of equalization and assessment to arrive at the state equalization rate for the county. The state board interpreted N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law art. 12 as having limited protests to only taxing districts and that the county was not a district. The court held that: (1) under article 12, the state board was required to establish a rate for that portion of the county roll that was within a city; (2) the state board's function was to determine a fair rate for the distribution of benefits and if there was disagreement, the remedy was an article 78 proceeding or a protest at the state board's annual hearings; (3) a refusal to recognize the county as an assessing unit was a denial of equal protection of the law to the county's citizens; and (4) the state rates were statistically adequate, legally operative, and fairly representative when weighed against any other known method because it permitted a petitioner to have sought relief in the courts without prohibitive cost.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the board's motions. The court decided the applicable equalization ratios to be applied for each year that was under review.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The failure of petitioner real property owners to appraise all selected sample parcels as provided in subdivision 3 of section 720 of the Real Property Tax Law is not fatal to petitioners' inequality proceeding against respondent Board of Assessors of the County of Nassau, in which establishment of the ratio of assessment to full value of all other properties in the tax district is necessary.  The sample parcel method is costly and time consuming, and litigants in an inequality proceeding may use either sample parcels, State Board of Equalization and Assessment (SBEA) ratios after 1969 or may rely upon cross-examination or rebuttal with respect to the parcels. Neither side may dictate the method of proof, the adequacy of which is within the discretion of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Unless the SBEA rates applicable to a tax district are shown to be completely biased or improperly obtained, such rates are presumptively correct and there is, accordingly, no burden on petitioners to show that the rates were validly established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The respondent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has been improperly excluded from formal appearances at hearings according taxing districts an opportunity to protest SBEA equalization rates.  The contention of the SBEA that respondent is not a taxing district entitled to standing misinterprets article 12 of the Real Property Tax Law and fails to recognize the Nassau County Government Law.  Respondents assess all real property in the county and represent the taxing district, since town assessors have been abolished.  Denial of a hearing violates due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The SBEA rule, that only classifications of property comprising 80% of the total assessed values of the taxing unit will be sampled, results in a downward bias in ratio by excluding high ratio properties, as does the &quot;two-thirds rule&quot;, which requires that not more than two thirds of the parcels sampled be parcels sampled in a previous survey.  The procedure of using an increased number of appraisals when there is a substantial difference between market value and the SBEA's estimated new value forces a further preconception of increased market value. Nevertheless, such bias is offset to a degree by the use of increasing market values two to three years prior to formulation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the State rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. While the SBEA methodology has many deficiencies, it is as sound as has been possible and has been sanctioned by the Court of Appeals </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Guth Realty v Gingold</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 34 NY2d 440). Accordingly, the State rates are found to be statistically accurate, legally operative and fairly representative compared to any other known method.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 50-year term lease provided that the lessees were to demolish the old building and erect a new one, but the state withheld issuance of the demolition permit for eight months. The court determined that the state's unauthorized action resulted in damages that included the loss of rent for the eight month period of the taking, plus the additional cost of construction occasioned by the delay, plus the loss of profit from the new building for the period of the delay in its completion. Because the objective was to make the lessees whole, the state's damages were mitigated by the higher rents that the lessees subsequently received due to the delay.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In 1966, the Metropolitan Opera Association moved its opera performances from its old opera house in New York City to the new facility at Lincoln&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Center.  The association then entered into a 50-year lease for the &quot;Old Met&quot; wherein the lessees agreed to demolish the old building and erect a large office building on the site.  Demolition was to start within six months of delivery of possession to the lessee and completion of the 40-story building was to be within three years of such delivery.  The association was to receive stipulated rentals and at the end of the lease, it would own the building as well as continue its ownership of the land.  The rental for the first four years was $ 200,000 per year.  Claimants, a limited partnership, are the assignees of the lease. Claimants obtained possession on May 10, 1966, and made an application for a demolition permit to the Superintendent of Buildings of the City of New York on May 16, 1966.  However, as the result of an unconstitutional legislative act whereby a corporation was created with powers of condemnation for the purpose of acquiring and preserving the &quot;Old Met&quot; (L 1966, ch 691), the demolition permit was not issued until January 17, 1967, eight months after application had been made.  Claimants received $ 154,700 of the $ 200,000 deposited by the corporation as security. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Claimants are entitled to damages for the eight month appropriation of their property by the State (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Keystone Assoc. v State of New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 39 AD2d 176, affd 33 NY2d 848). The measure of damages is not limited to the rental value of the vacant land; therefore, claimants were not adequately compensated by the receipt of $ 154,700 from the $ 200,000 deposited by the corporation as security.  Claimants are entitled to compensation for the increased cost of construction and its loss of profits for the period of the delay in completion of its building which were caused by the unauthorized action of the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. However, the State's damages are mitigated since claimants, as the result of a higher rental market during the eight-month delay in completion of the building, received higher rentals than would have been received if the building had been completed eight months earlier.  The basic object is to make claimants whole.  The eight-month profit loss plus the increased cost of construction total $ 4,988,300.  From this figure the computed present value of the additional rental income over a 10-year lease term of $ 4,361,492, is subtracted leaving an award rounded to $ 626,800.  From&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such $ 626,800, the $ 150,000 principal sum which claimant received from the security deposit must be subtracted. The resultant award figure is $ 476,800 plus 6% interest from January 1, 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Claimants are awarded $ 150,000 as reasonable counsel fees and legal expenses incurred in having the statute authorizing the taking declared unconstitutional, including expenses incurred in finally obtaining the demolition permit. Counsel fees and legal expenses incurred with respect to the instant claim are not allowable. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After petitioner former wife obtained an order that modified the parties' divorce decree so as to obligate respondent former husband to pay the wife alimony until she remarried, the husband filed an action to have the alimony provision annulled, under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 248, on the grounds that the wife had been habitually living with another man and holding herself out as his wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties separation agreement provided for support payments to the wife and was incorporated in the divorce decree. In the wife's subsequent enforcement proceeding, the separation agreement was abrogated and the decree was modified to provide for alimony payments to the wife until she remarried. In the husband's &sect; 248 action, the court ruled that by showing that the wife and her live-in companion executed a lease together as husband wife and were in fact living together, the husband clearly established the factual elements required to invoke &sect; 248. The court rejected the wife's claim that the husband was barred from invoking &sect; 248 because he voluntary stipulated to the modification of the divorce decree. The court ruled that the stipulation merged with the judgment and did not bar further modification of the modified decree. The court reduced the husband's alimony obligation after it balanced the statutory grounds for annulment and the wife's use of the payments for her and her companion's joint living expenses with the wife's inability to support herself and the fact that the separation agreement, had it remained in effect, would have barred annulment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three years after the accident, the default judgment was obtained and two months thereafter, the driver was served an order of suspension of his operator's license. The driver contended that &sect; 332 was unconstitutional because it did not serve a legitimate governmental purpose in the regulation of vehicular traffic on state highways and further, procedurally, was unlawful in that its sanctions became operative without any requirement of a hearing before the Commissioner. Finding that the statute was entitled to a strong presumption of regularity and validity as an enactment of the legislature and that its predecessor designation had expressly been held constitutional by the United States Supreme Court, the court upheld the statute and dismissed the driver's petition seeking a declaration of its unconstitutionality. In so doing, the court found that the cases upon which the driver relied were inapposite and that the driver could have obtained a hearing of his liability by answering the civil judgment cause. By his failure to defend in the civil case, the driver forfeited his right to a hearing on the merits and the Commissioner was not obligated to provide such a hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a series of raids in Chinatown carried out by police officers armed with search warrants, defendants sought to dismiss the accusatory instruments charging them with crimes of promoting gambling and possession of gambling devices. In the alternative, they filed motions for preliminary hearings and the suppression of evidence. The court refused to dismiss the informations on the ground that the statutes were unconstitutional, holding that they were not vague because they gave notice to defendants of the forbidden conduct. The court also denied the motions to dismiss on the grounds of discriminatory prosecution because defendants failed to present evidentiary facts in support of their claim. However, the court granted defendants' motions for a preliminary hearing, holding that the portion of &sect; 170.75 that excluded those charged with gambling crimes from the right to a hearing to determine reasonable cause was unconstitutional as violative of the Equal Protection Clause.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendants' motions to dismiss informations charging them with crimes of promoting gambling and possession of gambling devices and denied the motions to suppress evidence seized pursuant to warrants.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- gambling -- defendants' motions to dismiss accusatory instruments charging them with promoting gambling and possession of gambling devices (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 225.05</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">225.30</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">), are denied since statutory definition of advancing gambling activity is not void for vagueness -- no evidentiary facts were submitted to support defendants' charge that People were guilty of selective and discriminatory prosecution -- defendants have right to preliminary hearings since that part of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPL 170.75</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> which excludes such hearings to those charged with gambling offenses is violative of equal protection -- motion to suppress evidence is denied since search warrants and accompanying affidavits are not too indefinite regarding phrase &quot;any other person present&quot; in warrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Arrested in a series of raids and charged with promoting gambling and possession of gambling devices (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 225.05, 225.30), defendants made omnibus motions seeking determinations that the statutes are unconstitutional and that the People were guilty of selective enforcement, or in the alternative, that they&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be granted a preliminary hearing and that the evidence seized be suppressed.  With the exception of a finding of a right to a preliminary hearing, the motions are denied.  The statutory definition of advancing gambling activity (Penal Law, &sect; 225.00, subd 4), which is found in both of the statutes under which defendants were charged, is not void for vagueness. The term &quot;materially aids&quot; has its everyday meaning, is therefore not unconstitutionally vague, and the conduct penalized is sufficiently identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The motion to dismiss upon the grounds that the People were guilty of selective and discriminatory prosecution is denied.  To invoke the defense of discriminatory prosecution one must prove that the selection of the defendants for prosecution was deliberately based on their race or religion, and no evidentiary facts were submitted in support of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendants have a right to a preliminary hearing since that part of CPL 170.75 which excludes such hearings to those charged with violating article 225 of the Penal Law (gambling offenses), while not violative of the Fourth Amendment, is in violation of the equal protection clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions.  All&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  persons accused of misdemeanors, regardless of type, volume or punishment imposed, are similarly situated with respect to the primary statutory objective of CPL 170.75, which is to grant defendants an early hearing to see if there is reasonable cause to believe that they have committed a crime.  Whatever differences to exist between gambling crimes and other crimes, they are not reasonably related to the purposes of this act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The motion to suppress evidence seized in the raids is denied since the search warrants and accompanying affidavits are not too indefinite regarding the phrase &quot;any other person present&quot; in the warrants.  The location of the premises, the descriptions, and the type of activity alleged to have been observed clearly reduced any risk that an innocent person would be swept up.  A hearing to determine the truthfulness of the affidavits upon which the warrants were issued is denied since defendants' allegations of facts are not supported as required by CPL 710.60 (subd 1).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner filed a neglect petition, alleging that the mother's four children were neglected.

The corporation counsel requested the court to issue a warrant of arrest for the mother, and the mother's attorney sought the issuance of a stayed warrant.

N.Y. Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of New York filed motions to quash the subpoenas of defendants on newspaper reporters and television stations during the evidentiary hearing and trial of defendants for felony gun possession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested with their boss, a notorious figure in the illegal drug trade, and charged with felony gun possession. The arrests received extensive publicity. Defendants filed subpoenas for various news reports for the purpose of impeaching the statements of police officers during both an evidentiary hearing to suppress evidence and the trial. The State filed motions to quash the subpoenas. The court granted the motions to quash. The court found that the press did not have a testimonial privilege under the First Amendment or under the N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court found that N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 79-h purported to protect the newspapers from contempt, but it still did not grant immunity and, although the court did not reach the issue, the section might be unconstitutional. The court found, however, that the First Amendment provided an inherent right of confidentiality for the gathering and reporting of news. The court found that this right of confidentiality could be overcome by a showing of a defendant's need for a fair trial, but defendants had not made such a showing. The court found that defendants failed to lay a proper foundation for impeachment evidence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- right of confidentiality of newsmen -- testimonial privilege -- subpoenas served by defendants on reporters for various newspapers and broadcasting stations seeking materials relating to interviews with police officers for purposes of obtaining impeachment evidence are quashed; First Amendment inherent right of confidentiality here outweighs defendants' attempts to impeach prosecution's witnesses; alleged prior inconsistent statements made by police officers were collateral to issues and irrelevant -- right of confidentiality does not rise to level of exemption from testimonial compulsion; newsmen are not entitled to absolute testimonial privilege under free press clause of First Amendment (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Branzburg v Hayes, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">408 U.S. 665);</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> New York Shield Law ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Rights Law, &sect; 79-h</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) does not create privilege exempting reporters from complying with compulsory process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants, the alleged bodyguards of a notorious figure in the illicit drug trade, were arrested on felony gun possession charges.  The arrests were widely publicized in the print and broadcast news media. In connection with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this widespread publicity, several police officers, now prosecution witnesses, were interviewed by reporters for the various newspapers and broadcasting stations. Subpoenas served by defendants on various reporters seeking materials such as notes, memoranda and unused television tapes, relating to the interviews with the officers, for the purpose of obtaining impeachment evidence, are quashed.  There resides within the First Amendment and its freedom of the press clause an inherent right of confidentiality which attaches to the gathering and reporting of the news.  A free press, protected by a moderate amount of privilege of confidentiality of news information and source, insures a free flow of information to the people, and is indispensable to the continued maintenance of our form of Government.  This right of confidentiality does not rise to the level of an exemption from testimonial compulsion.  Rather, it is a factor which must be taken into account whenever it comes into conflict with the demand of a party for production of evidence in a judicial proceeding.  The privilege of confidentiality here outweighs defendants' attempts to impeach the prosecution's witnesses.  Defendants&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  failed to lay a proper foundation for the reception of such impeachment evidence. The alleged prior inconsistent statements made by the police officers were collateral to the issues.  The information in the hands of the media was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Newsmen are not entitled to an absolute testimonial privilege under the free press clause of the First Amendment immunizing them from the obligation to appear and testify in response to a subpoena issued on behalf of a defendant in a criminal action (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Branzburg v Hayes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 408 U.S. 665). In addition, the New York Shield Law ( Civil Rights Law, &sect; 79-h), which protects members of the press who assert a testimonial privilege from liability to the sanction of contempt, does not create a privilege exempting reporters from complying with compulsory process in trials and hearings.  To do so would be to improperly hold that the First Amendment right to gather and publish news is paramount to the rights of an accused in a criminal case to due process, a fair trial and to have compulsory process to obtain evidence in his favor.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for the crimes of burglary in the first degree and assault in the first degree. The victim testified at a preliminary hearing, after which he died. The state notified defense counsel of its intention to offer the testimony of the victim at the trial pursuant to the provisions of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 670.10. Before the court was defendant's motion to preclude use of the testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the preliminary hearing, defense counsel had the opportunity to and did fully examine the victim as to the pertinent issues within the scope of the hearing, but was limited concerning the question of identification of his assailants. The court granted defendant's motion to preclude the testimony in part. The court held that to the extent that the opportunity to cross-examine existed within the scope of inquiry at the preliminary hearing, whether or not the defendant availed himself of that opportunity, the testimony was admissible at a subsequent trial. Where, on the other hand, the opportunity for cross-examination was limited by the scope of the proceedings, and cross-examination was restricted on an issue outside the scope of the proceeding, any testimony related to that point in issue would be redacted. Here, the only area in which defense counsel did not have the opportunity for cross-examination was the identification of his assailants. The court ordered that the victim's testimony was admissible, but that any reference to identification of defendant had to be redacted for use at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's motion to preclude the deceased victim's prior testimony to the extent of precluding the people from offering the prior testimony of the victim that identified defendant as the perpetrator.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was indicted for burglary and assault and a preliminary hearing was held at which time the victim testified; thereafter the victim died. Defense counsel had the opportunity&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to and did fully examine the victim as to the pertinent issues within the scope of the hearing but was limited concerning the question of identification of the assailants by the victim.  Upon a motion by defendant to preclude the District Attorney from using the victim's testimony at trial, the motion is granted to the extent of precluding the testimony to the extent that it identifies the defendant as the perpetrator. The motion is denied as to the balance of the testimony for which there was a full and adequate opportunity for cross-examination. Although CPL 670.10 allows testimony given by a witness at the hearing upon a felony complaint to be read into evidence at a subsequent proceeding when the witness has since died, the constitutional right to confrontation must be applied in determining the application of the statute.  Thus prior testimony which has been subjected to the test of cross-examination will be admitted to the exclusion of testimony not so endowed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was appointed to represent an indigent defendant who had been indicted on various charges that ranged from the unauthorized use of a vehicle to murder. The indictments followed a manhunt that received national and international publicity after a man armed with a gun had four young campers tied to trees in a secluded area of a county. Early in the representation, defendant disclosed to the attorney that he had committed three other murders and knew where bodies of two of those victims were located. This information was disclosed at trial. These circumstances led to a subsequent investigation and charges against the attorney and had a disastrous effect on the attorney's practice. The attorney contended that the events constituted extraordinary circumstances that justified an allowance of compensation in excess of the limits in &sect; 722-b, The court held that the statutory limitation as applied to the circumstances were so grossly unjust as to be unthinkable. The court made a recommendation for disposition of the attorney's claims subject to review of a presiding judge of an appellate court and corrected certain totals of hours spent by the attorney in the petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner driver challenged the revocation of his registration and driver's license by respondent, the commissioner of the state department of motor vehicles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was operating a tractor to plow snow from his driveway when an automobile on the adjacent highway went out of control and collided with the tractor. The force of the impact drove the tractor out onto the highway. The driver and the operator of the automobile were cited for violations of the New York Vehicle and Traffic Law and the driver pleaded guilty to driving an unregistered vehicle. The commissioner then revoked the driver's registration and driver's license without a hearing. The driver filed an action challenging the revocation. The court noted that the commissioner routinely relied on unsworn evidence to support his issuance of mandatory revocation notices, so a licensee was forced to seek a postrevocation hearing in the context of a judicial review pursuant to N.Y.C.P.L.R. art. 78. The court held that to interpret N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect;&sect; 318(2)(a), 318(3), 318(5) as authorizing summary revocation of a driver's license on the basis of unverified hearsay evidence without providing the benefit of a prior hearing was violative of a licensee's right to due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the driver's application to the extent that it declared null and void the commissioner's revocation of his driver's license, without prejudice to the commissioner's right to conduct an administrative hearing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only time a licensee may be entitled to a hearing before revocation of his license and registration for operating a vehicle on a public highway while financial security is not in effect, in violation of section 318 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, is if he first raises a lack of knowledge that such security was not in effect and the commissioner then exercises his discretion to call a hearing.  The commissioner is vested&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with authority to revoke a registration and a license upon the receipt of any hearsay evidence. Since continued possession of a driver's license may be essential to a citizen's livelihood, revocation thereof involves State action that adjudicates important interests of the licensee and under the circumstances a license may not be taken away without procedural due process.  Accordingly, subdivisions 2, 3 and 5 of section 318 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law are unconstitutional insofar as the commissioner may revoke a license prior to the receipt of evidence at an administrative hearing. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted in a nine-count consolidated instrument for perjury, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 210.15; larceny, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 155.35; and forgery in the second degree. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for the state's failure to have properly charged the grand jury, N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect; 190.25, subd. 6; 210.20, subd. 1, para. c; 210.35, subds. 1, 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grand jury had been read the definition of perjury in the first degree. As to each of the seven counts of larceny, the grand jury was charged that at a specified time, defendant, as attorney for an estate, stole certain monies from the estate. There were no charges as to the degrees of grand larceny, or the definition of specific words used in the statute defining degrees of larceny. There were no charges setting out defendant's rights, powers, or duties as executor. As to the forgery count, the charge given the grand jury consisted of a reading two statutes regarding forgery and portions of a third forgery statute. The court held that under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 190.25, subd. 6 the grand jury had to have received an adequate statement of the law to guide its determination. Although the record showed sufficient evidence to support the indictment, the state failed to prove that a proper charge was given the grand jury. That failure was a substantive prejudicial denial of due process rendering the grand jury proceedings defective, N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 210.35, subd. 5.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On the presentation against defendant of seven counts of grand larceny, one count of perjury and one count of forgery, the District Attorney instructed the Grand Jury by giving brief statements with respect to the first eight counts, reading a definition of perjury and reading three statutes regarding forgery. There were no instructions concerning the degrees of larceny or corroboration of perjury and no instructions covering defendant's rights and duties in his capacity as executor of an estate from which he allegedly stole money.  Although the record established that the subsequent indictment was not induced by prosecutorial zeal or misconduct and the evidence was sufficient to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  support the indictment, a proper charge was not delivered.  The failure to properly instruct the Grand Jury constituted a substantive prejudicial denial of due process rendering the Grand Jury proceedings defective.  Accordingly, a motion to dismiss the indictment is granted, with leave to resubmit to another Grand Jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The contention that the Grand Jury was unconstitutionally constituted by the systematic exclusion of women is without merit.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a methadone patient, alleged that the aggregate weight standard, as applied to that substance, was unconstitutional. The trial court denied his motion to dismiss the indictment against him on that ground. Thereafter, defendant filed a motion for reargument. The court granted reargument and adhered to its original decision. Defendant asserted that the aggregate weight standard, as applied to the unauthorized possession or sale of small amounts of treatment methadone by patients in the process of rehabilitation, deprived him of equal protection. The court noted that methadone patients had the right to legally possess controlled substances that were the subject of abuse. Moreover, the government and programs functioning under its regulation were the primary suppliers of that substance. Therefore, the government, in order to prevent itself from becoming the unwitting partner of those in whom it had reposed its trust, was allowed to exact a higher penalty from those who trafficked in methadone. Moreover, the punishment prescribed for violations of N.Y. Penal Law art. 220 was not cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant took an interlocutory appeal from the prosecution's attempt to obtain reciprocal discovery in defendant's trial on charges of attempted assault in the third degree, obstructing governmental administration, and harassment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution sought discovery of information relating to whom defendant would call to testify at trial and what those witnesses would say. Defendant challenged, contending that the prosecution had no legal entitlement to such data. The court held that: (1) N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 240.20(4) did not provide for unrestricted reciprocal discovery; (2) N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect; 250.10 and 250.20 imposed duties of notice upon defendant if he intended to rely on certain defenses; (3) the information that the prosecution sought did not constitute &quot;property&quot; exempt from discovery under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 240; (4) the information that the prosecution sought was not discoverable under a bill of particulars; (5) the protections against discovery abuse which N.Y. Crim. Law &sect; 240.20 afforded to defendant meant that he would suffer no constitutional violation by being compelled to disclose the information requested; and (6) because the prospective defense witnesses' birth dates and pretrial statements were equally ascertainable by the prosecution, the prosecution's request was denied as to that information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the prosecution's motion for discovery of the names and addresses of defendant's prospective trial witnesses, but denied the request as to their birthdates and pretrial statements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- reciprocal discovery -- since pretrial statements of witnesses intended to be called at trial are exempt property within </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPL 240.10</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (subd 3, par [b]), People's motion for discovery of defendant's witnesses' statements is denied and court modifies its previous order with respect to defendant's motion for discovery to exclude pretrial statements of witnesses made to law enforcement officials; People's request for names and addresses of defendant's witnesses is granted -- requirements that information sought be material to preparation of case and that request be reasonable ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPL 240.20</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subds 3, 4), are not to be strictly construed -- names and addresses of witnesses are &quot;tangible personal or real property&quot; within </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPL 240.10</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (subd 2) -- grant of reciprocal discovery is not abuse of discretion, nor does it violate constitutional rights of either defendant or codefendant -- court adopts American Bar Association's Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial, so far as consistent with New York law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After defendant entered a plea of not guilty and made a motion for a bill of particulars, the People moved, pursuant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to CPL 240.20 (subd 4), for reciprocal discovery of the names, addresses, birthdates and pretrial statements of witnesses whom the defendant intended to call at trial.  Since CPL 240.10 (subd 3, par [b]) defines exempt property to include &quot;records of statements made to such parties, attorneys, or agents by witnesses or prospective witnesses in the case&quot;, the court modifies its previous order with respect to defendant's motion for discovery to exclude the pretrial statements of witnesses made to law enforcement officials, and accordingly, the People's demand for statements is also denied.  Defendant's request for the names and addresses of witness may be withdrawn if he has not yet received a list of the names and addresses of the People's witnesses.  The People's motion for the names and addresses of defendant's witnesses is granted, therefore the request for birthdates is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The requirements that the information sought be material to the preparation of the case, and that the request be reasonable ( CPL 240.20, subds 3, 4), are not to be strictly construed since this would put a great burden on both parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Names and addresses of witnesses are &quot;tangible personal or real&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  property&quot; within the meaning of CPL 240.10 (subd 2) and thus discoverable under CPL article 240.  The courts have never considered a demand for names and addresses of witnesses to belong in a motion for a bill of particulars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Granting reciprocal discovery here is not an abuse of discretion, nor does it result in a deprivation of defendant's constitutional rights, since if defendant is concerned with the possibility of his witnesses being intimidated from testifying by police or prosecutorial interrogation, his remedy is to apply to the court for protective order pursuant to CPL 240.20 (subd 5).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The disclosure of the names and addresses of defendant's witnesses does not violate constitutional and statutory rights of the codefendant since he is not deprived of any rights to which he would otherwise be entitled by defendant's having to disclose specified items, as the codefendant is not bound or precluded in any way thereby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The court adopts the American Bar Association's Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial, so far as consistent with New York law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's motion for a bill of particulars because the time periods involved in the indictment concerned events that had occurred seven or eight years before. Defendant testified before a county grand jury. A judicial decision was rendered that struck the county grand jury pool as it existed at the time of defendant's testimony because there was a systematic exclusion of students as a class and the deliberate exclusion of women, which constituted illegal discrimination. Defendant asserted that he was entitled to dismissal of the indictment because the jury pool was invalidly constituted, although he provided no basis for the claim that he had been deprived of constitutional rights or had been discriminated against. Later, the validity of the grand jury was upheld on the grounds that women had been included in the grand jury and the exclusion of students as a class was insignificant, and an appellate court held that review of the later judicial decision was not proper until an accused was convicted. A new grand jury was empaneled to continue the investigation of the challenged grand jury. The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mortgagee sought to recover the proceeds of a fire insurance policy under a standard fire insurance loss payable clause on the grounds that the price it paid for the mortgaged property at a foreclosure sale was less than the total indebtedness of the mortgagor to the mortgagee. The mortgagee asserted that it was entitled to the deficiency between the sale price of the property and the mortgagor's indebtedness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagor owned a building, which carried fire insurance and was located on the mortgaged property. The building was destroyed by fire. The mortgagor defaulted on its payments to the mortgagee. The mortgagee foreclosed on the property. The mortgagee purchased the building and property at a foreclosure sale, but there remained a large difference between the value of the property discharged by the sale and the mortgagor's indebtedness. The mortgagee did not move for a deficiency judgment within 90 days of the delivery of the deed, as required by N.Y. Real Prop. Acts. Law &sect; 1371, but sought recovery of the insurance proceeds. The court held that the mortgagee's failure to comply with the deficiency judgment provision of &sect; 1371 was fatal to its claim. The mortgagee was not necessarily entitled to the proceeds, even if it complied with &sect; 1371, because if the property was determined to be worth at least the value of the mortgagor's total indebtedness, the mortgagee was not entitled to a deficiency judgment, regardless of the price paid at the foreclosure sale.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. At a mortgage foreclosure sale held subsequent to a fire in the mortgaged premises, the mortgagee purchased the property for less than the amount of the mortgage debt, and failed to timely move for entry of a deficiency judgment, as provided for in section 1371 of the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law, which also provides that, if no such motion is made, &quot;the proceeds of the sale regardless of amount shall be deemed to be in full satisfaction of the mortgage debt and no right to recover any deficiency in any action or proceeding shall exist&quot;.  Its failure to make such a motion resulted in full satisfaction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the mortgage debt by operation of law, and, consequently, in termination of the mortgagee's insurable interest.

Under the fire insurance contract, loss is payable to the mortgagee &quot;as interest may appear&quot;, and the mortgagee's interest is coextensive with the debt it is owed. The statute did not wipe out that debt, but, rather, specified the remedy for enforcing it, and, by failing to use that remedy, the mortgagee, in effect, acknowledged that its debt had been satisfied by its taking the property.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had previously determined that defendant was a youthful offender but that he was not an eligible youth. The court had determined that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 720.10, insofar as it removed youthful offender status solely on the basis of the crime charged in the indictment, was unconstitutional. The court reviewed the relevant provisions of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 720.20(3) and N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 60.01, 60.02, 60.03, 65.00(1) to determine if five years' probation was a proper sentence. The legislative intention of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 60.02 was to limit the previous discretion to sentence a youthful offender as though he was an adult. Lifetime probation under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 65.00(3)(a)(ii) was not applicable to defendant. The court imposed five years' probation on defendant although &sect; 65.00(3)(a)(i) permitted the sentence for felonies other than class A-III. Sentencing under &sect; 65.00(3)(a)(i) was appropriate because there was no other applicable sentencing provision suitable in light of the determination that it was unconstitutional to sentence defendant as an adult based on the crime charged in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York statutory scheme which authorizes licensed barbers to cut the hair of both males and females ( General Business Law, &sect; 431, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  subd 4, par [a]) while restricting licensed hairdressers and cosmetologists to cut the hair of females only ( General Business Law, &sect; 401, subd 5) is violative of the equal protection guarantees of the Federal and State Constitutions since the classification made is not based upon any reasonable distinction and is illusory.  The male who wishes to have his hair cut by a hairdresser and is compelled by law to have a barber cut his hair, suffers an infringement upon his personal rights.  In order to be licensed as a cosmetologist, a person must attend a duly licensed beauty school and take 1,000 hours of instruction including 92 hours of haircutting. In order to be licensed as a barber, a candidate must take 1,000 hours of instruction at a duly licensed barber school, and thereafter fulfill an 18-month apprenticeship. In lieu of going to barber school, a candidate may extend his apprenticeship for six months.  The fact that barber courses include 400 hours on haircutting while beauty schools only allocate 92 hours to haircutting, is not significant on the issue of constitutionality.  If a hairdresser is trained and qualified to cut the hair of a female, he is qualified to cut the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  chemically similar hair of males. One who has been employed in barbering in a barber shop for at least two years may become a full-fledged licensed barber without attending any barbering school and without proving that he has any experience in the cutting of hair of either a male or a female. The 400-hour requirement does not mean that a barbering school student is required to cut the hair of a single female. In addition, hairstyling very frequently accompanies the cutting of hair of females, as well as the cutting of hair of males with long hair. Yet the barbers' curriculum does not include a single moment of study of hair styling while the hairdresser has devoted 291 hours of schooling to that subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statutory restrictions on haircutting placed upon hairdressers do not serve the function of promoting the health of patrons. The New York rules and regulations governing sanitation in the barber shops and in beauty parlors are identical.  The laws which seek to protect the health of those who patronize barber shops and beauty parlors are also identical (see General Business Law, &sect;&sect; 404, 407, subd 4; &sect; 433, subd 3; &sect; 434, subd 1, par [c]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The fact that a male would&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  receive a haircut in a beauty salon in the presence of other males and females would have no adverse effect upon the morals of anybody.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner widow brought an action against respondents, beneficiaries of joint accounts or Totten trusts, to obtain a determination as to the validity and effect of an election to take an elective share of an estate. The beneficiaries sought an order releasing certain funds. A determination was required as to which and how much of the accounts were deemed a testamentary substitute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In New York, the legislature changed the law relating to a spouse's elective share of a decedent's estate. Previously, assets outside the decedent's estate, such as joint bank accounts, were not subject to the spouse's election.  N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 5-1.1(b) was changed to provide that assets in the form of testamentary substitutes were also subject to the spouse's election if the transaction was made after marriage and after the law's effective date. The widow brought an action to determine which of the intestate decedent's assets were subject to the election. The court held that accounts the decedent funded and held in trust for others or as joint owner were exempt from the election if all deposits had been made prior to the law's effective date and no significant changes were made to the account after that date. When the form or site of the account was changed after the law's effective date, the changes were mere formalities. However, when the decedent changed the account's beneficiary, that change was significant and subjected the funds to the widow's election. Accounts owned in survivorship with the spouse were the widow's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that some of the decedent's property in the form of testamentary substitutes were subject to the widow's election while others were exempt from the widow's election in the widow's action to determine the decedent's assets subject to the widow's elective share.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Decedent and the surviving spouse were married in 1950, and he died intestate and without issue in June, 1973.  Prior to his death, decedent had set up several varied forms of joint accounts and Totten trusts to persons other than his wife.  The wife's right to elect against testamentary substitutes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is governed by EPTL 5-1.1 (subd [b]), and transactions which fall within its purview may qualify as testamentary substitutes if decedent made the transaction subsequent to the marriage and after August 31, 1966.  In proceedings to obtain a determination as to the validity and effect of her election to take an elective share of the estate, beneficiaries of joint accounts and Totten trusts seek an order releasing approximately one half of decedent's assets, and the central question is which and how much of these funds are deemed testamentary substitutes.  Some basic situations present themselves regarding changes in the dispositions prior and subsequent to August 31, 1966, and general observations may be made.  Transfers completely effectuated prior to August 31, 1966 remain untouched by the present statute and therefore all money deposited prior to that date and where no significant change in the account was made subsequent to that date is exempt from the widow's election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A change in beneficiary after August 31, 1966 brings the account out of the exempt status and makes it a testamentary substitute, since a change in beneficiary cannot be said to be &quot;merely formal&quot;, as it completely&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  changes the disposition that will be made at the death of the depositor. Therefore, as to accounts where the beneficiary was changed after August 31, 1966, the funds are testamentary substitutes subject to the right of election of the surviving spouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Regarding accounts where some money was deposited prior to the August 31 date, and some subsequent to it, only a portion is exempt. Moneys taken from a Totten trust and deposited in a savings account subsequent to August 31, 1966 are not exempt and considered testamentary substitutes.  Portions deposited prior to the date are exempt and are not to be included in decedent's estate for the purpose of the widow's right of election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Deposits of money by decedent in joint savings accounts prior to August 31, 1966, which accounts were thereafter closed and the funds contained therein redeposited by decedent subsequent to the date in other savings banks without a change of beneficiary in the form of Totten trust accounts, are not testamentary substitutes.  Transfers from one bank to another for the same beneficiary are not &quot;deposits&quot; made after August 31, 1966 and are therefore exempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Similarly, deposits in Totten trust accounts&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  subsequent to August 31, 1966, with beneficiaries unchanged, from funds withdrawn from Totten trust accounts maintained at other savings banks, are also exempt. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 153-c of the Public Authorities Law, which was enacted after the Jones Beach State Parkway Authority had raised the toll on the Southern State Parkway from 10 cents to 25 cents, rolled that toll back to 10 cents, and established a public disclosure procedure for any future toll increases, requiring, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that a detailed report explaining the need for a proposed increase is to be submitted to the Comptroller not less than 120 days prior to the effective date of such proposed increase; that the Comptroller is to make public his recommendations concerning the proposed increase within 60 days; that the Authority shall hold a public hearing upon the proposed increase not less than 15 days prior to its effective date, and that, after that hearing, the Authority shall reconsider the proposed increase and then take such action on a toll increase as it then deems necessary and advisable.  The provision therein for a rollback of the toll is unconstitutional, but the other provisions are constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The toll rollback&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provision is an unwarranted impairment of a pledge made by the State to the Authority's bondholders, contained in section 158-a (subd 1) of the Public Authorities Law, &quot;that it will not limit or alter the rights hereby vested in the authority * * * to collect revenues * * * in order that the authority may fulfill the terms of any agreements made with the holders of such bonds&quot;.  Nor may the impairment be justified as a reasonable exercise of the State's police power designed to cure the traffic congestion on local streets caused by motorists attempting to avoid the 25-cent toll. No allusion to any such traffic emergency is contained in the language of section 153-c.  And the section only has the effect of postponing the inevitable toll increase for 120 days.  But, even conceding a legislative intent to alleviate the traffic situation, the provisions of the section are not reasonably related to that end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The full disclosure provisions of the section do not impair the State's contractual obligation to the Authority's bondholders. The ultimate and final power to set the toll rate still remains in the hands of the Authority.  But, even assuming that those provisions are a theoretical&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or technical impairment, they constitute a reasonable exercise of the State's police power to safeguard the vital interests of the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Since the unconstitutional toll rollback provision and the constitutional disclosure provisions have separate objects and there is no mutual interdependence, the rollback provision may be stricken and the remainder of the section allowed to remain in full force.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased wife's will was executed in 1953 and bequeathed to the spouse a sum, in trust, equal to the minimum amount allowed to a surviving spouse under the provisions of the New York State Decedent's Estate Law at the time of the wife's death. Subsequently, but prior to the wife's death, &sect; 5-1.1 was enacted. N.Y Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 5-1.1(c) and (b) enlarged a surviving spouses elective rights. But, N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 5-1.1(a), which applied to wills drawn before September 1, 1966, limited the spouse's right of election to the amount available under the prior law. The court found the wife intended that changes in the law enacted subsequent to the will applied to fix the standard to measure her bequest. Also, the more expansive provisions of &sect; 5-1.1 controlled over the application of &sect; 5-1.1(a). The court concluded that the right of election was a nullity so far as altering the amount of property passing to the spouse. However, because the bequest was in trust, the court treated the right of election as a limited right of election under N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 5-1.1 (c)(1)(D), entitling the spouse to take $ 10,000 from the trust's principal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In her will testatrix, who died survived by her husband and two issue, bequeathed to her husband, in trust, &quot;a sum equal to and not in excess of the minimum amount allowed to a surviving spouse pursuant to the provisions of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the New York State Decedent's Estate Law at the time of my death relative to the right of election of such spouse to take his or her share of the estate as in intestacy&quot;.  This provision is construed as a direction that there be set over to testatrix' husband, in trust, an amount equivalent to a spouse's elective share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. At the time testatrix executed her will, prior to 1966, there was only one amount provided by statute for an elective share, one third of the net estate where decedent was survived by one or more issue, and, where the surviving spouse received a life estate under decedent's will, the corpus of which was equal in amount to the elective share, he had the limited right to withdraw $ 2,500 outright (Decedent Estate Law, &sect; 18).  However, in her bequest to her spouse, testatrix employed the phrase &quot;at the time of my death&quot;, thus indicating that the law as to elective rights which was extant at the time of her death would fix the standard to be applied in measuring the quantum of the bequest, and, by the time she died, EPTL 5-1.1 had been enacted, subdivision (a) of which provides that, as to wills executed prior to September 1, 1966, a surviving spouse has the same right&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of election as he had had under section 18 of the Decedent Estate Law, but subdivision (c) of which permits a surviving spouse, for the purpose of election against wills executed after September 1, 1966, to share not only in the decedent's net estate but also in an estate consisting of specified </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter vivos</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transactions, testamentary in nature and denominated testamentary substitutes, and, where the surviving spouse receives a life estate under the will, the corpus of which is equal to the elective share, gives him the right to withdraw $ 10,000 outright. This enlargement of elective rights was the result of social legislation designed to prevent a decedent from impoverishing a surviving spouse and to give a legislatively determined equitable portion of a decedent's property to the surviving spouse, and the exception made for wills drawn prior to September 1, 1966 was reluctantly inserted into the statute only because of a fear that the new testamentary substitutes doctrine might run afoul of due process provisions and be held unconstitutional if made applicable where the will antedated the effective date of the statute.  To conclude that this was within the contemplation of testatrix&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would be unreasonable.  Therefore, and viewing EPTL 5-1.1 in its entirety and considering its purpose, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the provision containing testatrix' bequest to her husband is construed to bequeath to him, in trust, an amount equal to his elective share computed under subdivision (c) of EPTL 5-1.1, and he has the limited right to take $ 10,000 absolutely from the principal of the trust.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to the wife's affidavit in support of her motion for civil arrest, she turned over her personal jewelry to the husband to place in a hotel's safety deposit box. The following week, after she arrived home, she discovered that the husband had appropriated the jewelry to himself. She also claimed that he refused to return the jewelry, despite her repeated requests, as well as the requests of their children. The husband, in response to the statements made in the wife's affidavit, denied that the jewelry was her personal property. He also claimed that she exaggerated the value of the jewelry. The husband did, however, admit he had possession of the jewelry. The court denied the wife's motion for civil arrest because the language of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator alleged that the ordinances at issue were invalid because the operator's right to do business was unconstitutionally infringed upon.

On consideration of the operator's motion, the court granted the operator's request to dismiss the information against him after determining that part of the ordinances were unconstitutional. Specifically, the court held that parts of &sect;&sect; 90 and 92, regarding the maximum size of gasoline advertising signs, were unconstitutional, oppressive, and an undue burden on the operator's right to conduct his business despite the purpose of the ordinances to apprise consumers of product prices. In addition, the court noted that it was more reasonable to require a minimum size to prevent deception, but to place a limit on a maximum sign, without specifying the minimum size of the numbers and lettering, was clearly unreasonable and entirely failed to accomplish the purpose of the ordinances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One defendant was observed placing his hand into the pocket of another man and removing a wallet therefrom and the other defendant was observed placing his hand next to the pocket of one man and touching the purse of a woman. Section 165.25 stated that a person was guilty of jostling when, in a public place, he intentionally and unnecessarily placed his hand in the proximity of a person's pocket or handbag. Defendants argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad in that it failed to give proper notice as to what conduct was prohibited, that it failed to fix an ascertainable standard of guilt, and that it had no requirement of a culpable mental state. The court held that it was unclear what the statute meant by &quot;proximity&quot; and that the statute relied heavily upon a police officer's discretion because placing one's hands in the proximity of another person's handbag in a crowded subway could be equally consistent with guilt or innocence. However, the court was bound to hold the statute constitutional based on a decision of the Court of Appeals affirming convictions in an unrelated case in which the identical constitutional issues were raised.</SPAN></P>

Jostles or crowds another person at a time when a third person's hand is in the proximity of such person's pocket or handbag&quot;.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff president sought a temporary injunction within the framework of his action for a declaratory judgment to restrain defendant State, and its agent, the State Tax Commission, from proceeding against him personally to collect the sum of $ 54,436 assessed against the president as a person who was required to collect sales and use taxes for a corporation. The corporation had been adjudicated a bankrupt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The president's complaint alleged that the corporation transferred its accounts, inventories, and other assets to another company under security liens and factoring agreements, thereby relieving the president from any such liability. The only notice the president claimed that he received of the assessment was a notice and demand for payment of sales and use taxes due. The notice was followed by a subpoena that required the president to appear and explain how the assessed amount would be paid by him personally under penalty of contempt. It was this enforcement proceeding that the president sought to restrain in the motion. The State filed a cross motion for a dismissal of the action and the motion. The court concluded that: (1) the action was proper in form as a declaratory judgment; (2) the declaratory judgment action brought against the State did not have to be dismissed for failure to name the Tax Commission as a party defendant; and (3) the tax assessment had to be decided in the president's declaratory judgment action as an issue of fact. The court ordered the State to answer the action within 10 days of the date of the order herein with notice of entry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After the bankrupt corporation of which plaintiff was president transferred its accounts, inventories and other assets to another corporation under security liens and factoring agreements, the State Tax Commission proceeded against plaintiff personally to collect the sum of $ 54,436.80 assessed against him as &quot;a person required to collect sales and use taxes&quot; on behalf of his corporation (Tax Law, &sect; 1131, subd 1; &sect; 1133).

Since there are no statutory administrative procedures empowering the Tax Commission to hold hearings to determine who is personally liable as a &quot;person required to collect taxes&quot;, any administrative proceeding would be inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried for crimes that arose from the firing of a gun in a restaurant upon a certification that he had sufficiently recovered from his mental illness to understand the charges against him and assist in his defense. Defendant claimed that at the time of the incident he lacked the capacity to understand the consequences of his acts and that they were wrong, and raised an equal protection issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant fired at four people and did substantial damage. Charged with the shooting and possession of a weapon, defendant was found to be incapacitated and was committed for care and treatment. In three months he was certified as a controlled schizophrenic having recovered sufficiently to understand the proceedings against him and assist in his defense, and he was tried. Defendant contended that he was not guilty because of his lack of capacity at the time, pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 30.05, and to commit him afterward without proof of a current mental disability was a denial of due process and equal protection. The court held that: (1) N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.20(1) required commitment upon a verdict of acquittal by reason of mental disease or defect, but it was unenforceable as written and the trial court was left to apply it in a constitutional manner; (2) a brief period of hospitalization, for examination and report whether defendant could be released without danger to himself or to others, was no invasion of his rights; and (3) equal protection did not require that all persons be dealt with identically, but that a distinction be relevant to its purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the commitment of defendant until it was certified that he could be released on condition without danger to himself or to others, and directed that the commissioner report to the court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was indicted for various crimes after shooting a pistol at the premises of a well-known&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  restaurant in New York City.  Defendant was subsequently acquitted of all criminal charges since, &quot;as the result of mental disease or defect he lacked substantial capacity to know or appreciate the nature and consequence of his acts&quot; (Penal Law, &sect; 30.05).  Consequently, pursuant to CPL 330.20, defendant is properly committed to the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Hygiene for the purpose of determining whether he &quot;may be discharged or released on condition without danger to himself or others&quot; or whether he is presently afflicted with mental disease or defect &quot;which is likely to result in serious harm to himself or others&quot; (Mental Hygiene Law, &sect; 31.37, subd [a]) thereby requiring &quot;involuntary care and treatment&quot; (Mental Hygiene Law, &sect; 31.27).  Defendant's commitment to the custody of the commissioner without prior adjudication of need thereof and without proof of current &quot;mental disease or defect&quot;, is not a denial of due process or equal protection of the laws.  A &quot;commitment&quot; of indefinite duration without hearing or proof of necessity would be an unconstitutional invasion of defendant's rights, particularly where such safeguards are available in all other involuntary hospitalizations. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, the &quot;commitment&quot; called for by CPL 330.20 (subd 1) only means commitment &quot;for detention examination and report as to sanity&quot;.  Where the need appears to exist, a brief period of hospitalization for the purposes of examination is no invasion of a patient's constitutional rights.  The statute requires the commissioner to detain defendant only so long as should be reasonably necessary to examine him and report his findings to the court.  If the commissioner determines that defendant should continue to be detained, he shall petition for the retention of the patient (Mental Hygiene Law, &sect; 31.33).  Similarly, if he determines that defendant should be discharged or released on condition, he shall petition for such discharge or release in his report ( CPL 330.20, subd 2).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The fact that some civil commitments are based on the allegedly more stringent commitment standard of whether a person is &quot;mentally ill and in need of involuntary care and treatment&quot;, while the only allegedly more lenient commitment standard the commissioner must apply pursuant to CPL 330.20 is whether the patient &quot;may be discharged or released on condition without danger to himself or others&quot;, does not result&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in a denial of equal protection. It is not required that commitment procedures following an acquittal of a crime by reason of mental disease or defect be identical to commitment procedures in noncriminal cases so long as variation is reasonably required by variation in circumstance.  Defendant endangered the lives of four people.  Reasonable precaution must be taken so that others shall not be furthered endangered by him ( CPL 330.20, subd 2).  </SPAN></P>

In their motion for reargument, the employers contended R. 6201 and 6211 were unconstitutional to the extent they collectively permitted attachment merely upon a claimant's ex parte allegation of fraud.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an action by the trustees of welfare and pension funds, to recover for fraud on the part of defendants, who, under collective bargaining and trust agreements, were required to make payments to those&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  funds based upon the number of employee hours worked, and who, as alleged by plaintiffs and not contradicted by defendants, submitted false reports detailing employee hours and the amount due, with the result that the funds became substantially underpaid, defendants move for reargument of a prior motion by them to vacate an order of attachment obtained by plaintiffs.  In denying the motion to vacate, the court had declined to hold the New York attachment statute ( CPLR art 62) unconstitutional to the extent it permitted attachment without prior notice in an action to recover a money judgment for fraud, finding that the New York attachment statute met the requisites of procedural due process laid down in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Mitchell v Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (416 U.S. 600), wherein the validity of a Louisiana sequestration statute was upheld.  On their present motion for reargument, defendants cite </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Sugar v Curtis Circulation Co</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (383 F Supp 643), decided subsequent to the denial of their motion to vacate, wherein a three-Judge Federal court, observing that the New York attachment statute was strikingly similar to the Louisiana statute, upheld in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Mitchell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in all respects but one, invalidated the New York statute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the ground that it did not guarantee a defendant an opportunity for an immediate post-seizure hearing, at which the plaintiff must prove the grounds upon which the writ was issued.  The original determination sustaining the order of attachment is adhered to.  The decision in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Sugar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case, which has been stayed pending appeal to the United States Supreme Court, is not controlling.  Moreover, the New York statute does afford a defendant an opportunity for an immediate post-seizure hearing, since a motion to vacate may be made and a hearing obtained where the facts asserted are challenged, which is not the case here.  And that due process is necessarily violated by imposing upon a defendant the burden of proof on a motion to vacate is not nearly as clear as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Sugar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggests, nor are the New York authorities as definitive with respect to the burden of proof as it suggests.  But, even assuming that the prevailing case law does impose the burden upon the defendant, such rule is neither implicit in nor directed by the New York statute, and, therefore, should not affect its constitutionality.  </SPAN></P>

The landlord raised an affirmative defense and counter claim, contending that the tenant abandoned the premises upon her failure to tender rent and that the removal of property was authorized under the lease. The court granted the tenant's motion for partial summary judgment on her claims and determined that regardless of whether the tenant abandoned the premises or was locked out, the landlord had no right to her personal property. The court concluded that the landlord's seizure of the tenant's personal property, which was based upon the alleged non-payment of rent, and was prohibited by N.Y. Aband. Prop. Law &sect; 1310. The court denied the landlord's motion for summary judgment on its claims for past-due rent and expenses related to the removal and storage of the tenant's possessions upon a finding that the tenant was not a party to the lease agreement and that the tenant asserted ownership of the property by filing an action in conversion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner urban renewal agency filed a condemnation proceeding against respondent property owner, who alleged that the agency had no valid public use for his property and, used unconstitutional methods and procedures. He further claimed that the agency did not negotiate the acquisition of his property in good faith and that a planning commission's vote was void because a member should have disqualified himself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner disputed the agency's decision to include his property in an expanded urban renewal zone. The court noted that N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 668 (1968) established the agency and there was no contention that the it lacked authority or that statutory requirements were not met. Rather, the property owner contended that an amended urban renewal plan, which extended the original boundary to include the property owner's building, was illegal and improper. The court held that the decision to expand the renewal area and the agency finding of a public purpose were authorized acts that were not justiciable on the record presented. The proof suggested no reason for the agency to pursue negotiations with the property owner, who had in effect locked them out. There was no merit to the contention that the agency was not properly constituted under &sect; 668 and N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 553(4). Finally, a planning commission vote was not void because of a member's prior confrontation with the property owner. The challenged member was presumed to have acted properly in the public interest in the absence of facts that showed otherwise. The agency was directed to submit a judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court directed entry of a judgment favorable to the agency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent domain -- urban renewal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. It is not necessary that a plan for the use of property included within an urban renewal project be formulated prior to its condemnation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The elimination of slums, unsanitary and blighted areas has been declared to be a public purpose and, once the local authorities who have been constitutionally and statutorily empowered to determine that an area is substandard and insanitary have made their finding, not corruptly, irrationally or baselessly, it is not subject to judicial review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In determining what properties should be included within the boundaries of an urban renewal project, or subsequently annexed to the project, the test is as to the area as a unit, and not as to any one or more particular structures.  It could be found that a particular property was necessary to the project by reason of a prominent setting or key location, or other factors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. As to a claim that an urban renewal agency did not negotiate in good faith for the purchase of property now sought to be condemned, since it purchased an adjacent building for a sum greater than it offered for the subject property, and still had an unexpended appropriation, there is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  no evidence that the two structures were of comparable value, nor does the proof suggest any reason for it to have pursued negotiations further, particularly when the owner told it that the property was not for sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. An urban renewal agency which, as mandated by the statute creating it (General Municipal Law, &sect; 668), consists of the members of the city council and the Mayor, is legally constituted.  The statutory scheme of the Urban Renewal Agency Act (General Municipal Law, art 15-A) itself provides that any one or more of the members of an urban renewal agency may be an official or employee of the municipality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. As to a claim that a member of the planning commission which approved the boundaries of an urban renewal project &quot;should have disqualified himself&quot;, there is no showing that he was, in fact, disqualified or that any legal basis for his disqualification existed.  Despite an alleged &quot;severe personality clash&quot; between him and the owner of property included within the project, there is a presumption he performed his public duty honestly and in accordance with law, and no evidence rebuts that presumption.  Moreover, the landowner did not make any challenge to the member's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  qualification at a time when the issue, if he really considered there was one, could have been promptly met and disposed of or preserved for judicial consideration.  </SPAN></P>

The court issued a judgment denying the judgment creditor's claim and vacating its levy on the funds. The debtor had authority under N.Y. Pub. Hous.

As the security was pledged to the note holder before anyone else obtained claims against the debtor, and as under &sect; 47 the note holder's security interest could not be diminished by the uniform commercial code, the note holder's security interest in the funds was superior to the judgment creditor's interest in the funds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff bank commenced an interpleader action to determine adverse claims to funds on deposit in the account of defendant Housing Authority.  In November, 1969 the Housing Authority entered into a contract with defendant judgment creditor for construction of low-rent housing in the City of Troy.  Defendant judgment creditor may not satisfy its judgment, filed May 30, 1973, from the funds on deposit in the account of the Authority, since defendant United States of America, Department of Housing and Urban Development, in accordance with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the provisions of section 1401 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. of title 42 of the United States Code and section 47 of the Public Housing Law, has established a perfected security interest prior in time to the interest of defendant judgment creditor in said funds.  On March 12, 1969, in furtherance of the powers delegated to it by section 47 of the Public Housing Law, the Housing Authority lawfully executed and delivered to the United States an advance note in the amount of $ 1,848,075 secured by a first pledge of and lien on residual receipts of the low-cost housing project. As additional security, said note pledged, mortgaged, conveyed and granted unto the United States an interest in all the real and tangible property owned or to be owned by the Authority.  The Authority also executed and filed a declaration of trust creating a trust in the project in favor of the United States, including rent revenues, annual contributions and other receipts.  Such action by the Authority granted to the United States a security interest prior to everyone else in the world, incapable of being diminished by the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code ( &sect; 9-104).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The declaration of trust containing a covenant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  against alienation of the corpus is not void since inalienability of principle is not forbidden when the purpose of such restraint is to protect the beneficiary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The pledge of the Authority's bank deposits to the United States as a bondholder is not fraudulent as to defendant judgment creditor. All expenditures by the Housing Authority must have the prior approval of the United States, therefore, leave by the United States to permit necessary expenditures by the Authority immunizes those expenditures from the charge of being fraudulent conveyances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a juvenile delinquency proceeding in the Family Court of New York, New York County, respondent juvenile filed a motion to suppress firearms seized by petitioner detective from his apartment. The juvenile claimed that the seizure of the evidence violated his U.S. Const. amend. IV rights. The detective had learned of the guns when he searched another boy and found photos that showed the juvenile standing in a room and holding some firearms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile and the boy belonged to the same gang. The detective was not looking for evidence against the juvenile. However, after he found the photos, the detective located the juvenile on the street, showed him the photos, and stated that he wanted the guns. The juvenile told him he did not have those guns, but that he had some others. The juvenile let the detective in his apartment, and showed him some revolvers. The detective then seized those guns. On appeal, the court held that the juvenile did not have standing to contest the search of the other boy's person. The court also held that, having seen the photos, the detective had probable cause to &quot;stop and frisk&quot; the juvenile and to ask him a reasonable number of questions related to the guns. The court ruled that the juvenile was not entitled to a Miranda warning, or to have a parent present, when the detective questioned him briefly on the street about the guns. Further, the court held that because the detective had a reasonable fear that the guns would disappear if he took the time to get a search warrant for the apartment, exigent circumstances existed that justified his warrantless search of the apartment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the juvenile's motion to suppress the evidence of the firearms seized by the detective in the search of the juvenile's apartment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- juvenile delinquents -- searches and seizures -- police, presumably unlawfully, searched four boys on street and seized from one of them some apparently recent snapshots showing another one of them sitting in living room and holding two guns -- photographed boy cannot object to search of, and seizure from his companion -- such seized photographs showed probable cause to arrest photographed boy and to question him briefly, without warning -- he took detective to his home and indicated that guns were in dresser drawer -- since guns were easily removable, no time to apply for search warrant -- detective properly seized those guns -- in juvenile delinquency proceeding against photographed boy, his motion to suppress seized guns is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Police in a patrol car saw, in front of a &quot;club&quot;, a juvenile whom they had a warrant to arrest for possession of a gun. He, and all the others hereinafter mentioned, were members of a juvenile gang under police surveillance.  He disappeared into the club, whereupon the police&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  waited at the back door; and soon four other boys emerged into the street. The police searched all four, presumably illegally.  They found and seized, in and from the pocket of one of them, six apparently recent snapshot photographs showing another one of those four boys sitting in a living room and holding a revolver and a sawed-off shotgun.  Under the circumstances, it does not matter who owned the photographs; the photographed boy does not have any standing to dispute the lawfulness of the search of his companion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The photographs showed probable cause to arrest the photographed boy, and to stop and frisk and question him then and there, briefly, without a warrant, and without advising him of constitutional rights ( CPL 140.50; Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 436-5.0, subd g).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. When the detective said to the boy, &quot;I want those guns&quot;, the boy said he had guns in his home.  There was no time to apply to a court for a warrant to search the boy's home for guns, since meantime his companions could easily have removed the guns. The detective was not abusive to this 14-year-old boy and did not use force.  He merely accompanied the boy home, and there the boy unlocked&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the apartment door and indicated that he had guns in the top drawer of a dresser; and thereupon the detective properly found in that drawer, and properly seized, two loaded revolvers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Accordingly, in this juvenile delinquency proceeding against the photographed boy, his motion to suppress the two seized revolvers from evidence is denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court were motions by defendant tortfeasors and intervenor Attorney-General for an order dismissing the complaint on the merits and plaintiff injured parties' motions for summary judgment, in three cases which were consolidated for the purpose of determining the validity of article XVIII of the Insurance Law, the No-Fault Insurance Law. The Attorney-General also moved to dismiss for lack of the injured parties' capacity to sue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged statute precluded a action against the tortfeasor in automobile accidents, unless the economic loss exceeded $ 50,000. In all three cases, the economic loss was less than $ 500.00. Thus, under the statute, the right of access to the court so that an individual could recover for noneconomic losses was eliminated unless the party sustained a serious injury or had an accident with a noncovered person. In determining that the statute was invalid in its entirety, the court held that the legislature had no authority to take away the rights of the public, without its consent, to recover for tort injuries without at least constitutional amendment. New or supplemental legislation could not contradict or contravene the state Constitution itself, to which such legislation must be subordinate. The classification contained in the law as to serious injury was arbitrary and unreasonable. The court found that the statute did not provide a new system of benefits, but only a barred the rights of some individuals to sue in tort with absolutely nothing in return.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motions of the tortfeasors and the Attorney-General dismissing the complaints were denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- no fault automobile insurance -- article XVIII of Insurance Law is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> and invalid in its entirety; said law is unwarranted deprivation of rights of automobile accident victims to recover their actual damages from tort-feasors in trial by jury -- classifications contained in &quot;No Fault&quot; law as to &quot;covered&quot; and &quot;noncovered&quot; persons are arbitrary and unreasonable -- threshold &quot;serious injury&quot; (Insurance Law, &sect; 671) requirement is arbitrary and unreasonable; definition of terms &quot;serious injury&quot; and &quot;significant disfigurement&quot; are void for vagueness -- $ 500 medical expense threshold does not rest on rational basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The &quot;No Fault&quot; automobile insurance law (Insurance Law, art. XVIII), which provides for compulsory vehicle insurance to compensate &quot;covered&quot; persons for basic economic loss up to $ 50,000 for injuries without regard to fault, and which also eliminates the right of an individual to recover for noneconomic loss unless a &quot;serious injury&quot; (Insurance Law, &sect; 671) is sustained, is unconstitutional and invalid in its entirety. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Article XVIII is an unwarranted deprivation of the rights of automobile accident victims to recover their actual and long-recognized bodily injury damages from tort-feasors in a trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The classifications contained in the &quot;No Fault&quot; law as to &quot;covered&quot; and &quot;noncovered&quot; persons are arbitrary and unreasonable.  The statute creates a discriminatory system of coverage wherein persons who are injured by &quot;covered&quot; persons may not have access to the courts while a person injured by &quot;noncovered&quot; persons may commence an action for damages and seek recovery for pain and suffering. There is further no rational reason why an individual who is injured in a nonautomobile tort may have access to the courts while a person sustaining the same injury and effects in an automobile accident is barred therefrom, if the &quot;serious injury&quot; test requirement is not met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The classification contained in the law as to the threshold &quot;serious injury&quot; requirement is arbitrary and unreasonable and is therefore invalid as a denial of equal protection of the laws.  The definition of the terms &quot;serious injury&quot; and &quot;significant disfigurement&quot; are void for vagueness and violate the fundamental requisites&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Section 671 which defines a personal injury as a &quot;serious injury&quot; if reasonable medical costs would exceed $ 500, does not rest on a rational basis. Medical expenses vary substantially from one area of the State to another and even within areas with respect to all classifications of medical treatment.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged daughter claimed she was the decedent's legitimate child under a Florida common-law marriage and had priority to be awarded letters of administration. The court rejected the alleged daughter's claim and granted the prospective administrator the letters of administration. The alleged daughter failed to prove a common-law marriage under Florida law, where her proof at most inferred that she was born from a meretricious relationship and out of wedlock. She also failed to produce an order or filiation declaring paternity. The alleged daughter was not entitled to inherit under Florida law because all parties, including the deceased, were domiciled in New York on the date of death. New York law determined the descent and distribution of the deceased's estate because that was the alleged daughter's place of residence at the time of the deceased's acknowledgment that determined her status as to his eligibility to inherit.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner, born in Florida, is the out-of-wedlock daughter of decedent. Petitioner's mother and decedent cohabited in Florida for three years until decedent moved to Buffalo, New York, where he died on October 13, 1974.  Petitioner's mother refused to marry decedent in Florida subsequent to the birth of petitioner.  Since petitioner has not sustained her burden of proving that a valid common-law marriage, as defined by the State of Florida, existed between her mother and decedent at the time of her birth, she is not the legitimate daughter of decedent and is therefore not awarded letters of administration. The proof infers that petitioner is a child born from a meretricious relationship which does not support the common-law marriage relationship&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under Florida law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since no order of filiation declaring paternity was made by a court of competent jurisdiction, petitioner is not the distributee of decedent ( EPTL 4-1.2, subd [a], par [2]) and is therefore not entitled to letters of administration.</SPAN></P>

Decedent, in an insurance policy, acknowledged petitioner as his daughter, which under Florida law would make petitioner an heir of decedent entitled to inherit from him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People appealed from an order of the City Court of Buffalo (New York), which dismissed an information charging defendant with violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.38. The trial court found that &sect; 130.38 was unconstitutional because it denied equal protection of the law to citizens not married to each other in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the statute would make criminals of some citizens, but not others, on the basis of an unsupportable distinction and would constitutionally wrongfully deny to the former the equal protection of the law. The court rejected that conclusion. The court noted that traditionally, the system of jurisprudence in New York had recognized discriminate application and enforcement of laws as they affected certain classes of citizens such as minors and married persons. The court vacated the order and agreed with a federal court's statement that a rational foundation existed for the state's discrimination between acts of consensual sodomy committed by married and unmarried persons. No matter who the participants were, such deportment in public violated the prohibition of &sect; 130.38. The court noted that if the participants had been married to each other, they could have been prosecuted under New York State's public lewdness statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 245.00.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Section 130.38 of the Penal Law, which makes it a crime to engage in deviate sexual intercourse with another person, is not unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection to citizens not married to each other in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and section 11 of article I of the New York Constitution, since discriminate application and enforcement of laws as they affect certain classes of citizens such as minors and married persons has been recognized and a rational foundation exists for the State's discrimination between acts of consensual sodomy committed by married and unmarried persons; the argument that it is criminal for unmarried people to engage in sodomy in public, but not for married people to do so is rejected, since if the participants had been married to each other they could be prosecuted under the public lewdness statute (Penal Law, &sect; 245.00), and preventing a violation of public decency is a legitimate concern of the Legislature.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant paid his bill while preserving his rights via a protest so as to protect his property against encumbrance. The city's contention was that once N.Y. Local Fin. Law &sect; 11.00(a)(42-a) was declared unconstitutional, and a nonretroactivity doctrine was adopted, the New York Court of Appeals rendered the vehicle of protest impotent and effectively barred recovery of overpayment notwithstanding timely protest. The court granted judgment in favor of the taxpayer and rejected the city's theory. Illegal taxes, voluntarily paid were not recoverable, but illegal taxes involuntarily paid were recoverable; and, in enunciating the nonretroactivity doctrine, the New York Court of Appeals did not annul or abrogate a citizen's right to pay disputed taxes and filing a protest to the same.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion for reargument was made on the assumption that the differences between the facts alleged in the complaint and those in the creditor's opposing affidavits were so great as to require dismissal of the complaint. However, notwithstanding the possible differences in technical legal theory between the complaint and the creditor's affidavits, it was clear that both referred to the same transaction, an indebtedness arising from an allowance of a credit by the creditor to a buyer of the debtor's goods based upon a claim of breach of warranty. The creditor, acting as a selling agent, sold the debtor's goods, advancing to the debtor a sum of money with the expectation of being reimbursed from the net proceeds of the sale. The books were kept on an accrual basis. The buyer, a Canadian, was dissatisfied with the goods, obtained a credit against the creditor, who in turn sought reimbursement from the debtor. The balance due was in accordance with the complaint. The court would not vacate the attachment, which it held to be constitutional and valid, as the creditor had a meritorious complaint and attachment was necessary to secure jurisdiction over a nonresident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers alleged that &sect; 423 violated the state and federal Constitutions, as it (1) did not further the slum clearance purpose set forth in N.Y.

The court held that while the taxpayers has standing to bring the action, their motions were denied, and defendants' summary judgment motions were granted. The court held that N.Y. Real Prop.

The taxpayers failed to show that the legislators had any exclusive knowledge of facts bearing on the intention of the legislature. The court held that &sect; 423 did not violate N.Y. Const. art.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- redevelopment company projects -- tax abatement -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 423 of Real Property Tax Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (L 1974 ch 941) granting tax abatements and other benefits to redevelopment projects is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">&nbsp;section 423 is part of on-going scheme of neighborhood rehabilitation and is therefore within authorized slum clearance purpose of article XVIII of State Constitution -- redevelopment projects represent rational classification for tax abatement; section 423 does not violate Equal Protection Clauses of State or Federal Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 423 of the Real Property Tax Law (L 1974, ch 941) granting tax abatements to redevelopment company projects, without income limitations, and further subjecting the rents in said projects to rent ceilings and guaranteeing the tenants' rights to lease renewals pursuant to the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 (Administrative Code of City of New York, tit YY, ch 51), is not unconstitutional.  The purpose of section 423 is the prevention of undue hardship and dislocation to the projects, the persons and families residing therein and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the municipalities in which such projects are located.  The statute provides that the real property taxes payable on redevelopment projects upon the expiration of the 25-year tax exemption granted to such projects pursuant to section 125 of the Private Housing Finance Law (Redevelopment Companies Law of 1942), will be phased out over a 10-year period, at which time they will be fully taxable.  Although the subject redevelopment projects, owned by defendant insurance company, are no longer slum areas in need of physical rehabilitation, the tax abatements granted defendant under section 423 are nevertheless lawful since section 423 is part of an on-going scheme of neighborhood rehabilitation and is therefore within the authorized slum clearance purpose of article XVIII of the State Constitution.  Article XVIII is permissive and flexible and was not intended to deprive the State of its otherwise inherent power to achieve valid purposes in the field of housing. The 25-year program of neighborhood rehabilitation of the Redevelopment Company Law was not conceived or carried out only as a narrow program of physical reconstruction and is not required to be interpreted as such in contradiction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Legislature's determination that 10 years more is required to maintain stability of neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Redevelopment projects represent a rational classification for tax abatement. Therefore, section 423, which is a general law applicable to all redevelopment company projects in the State, does not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the State or Federal Constitution and is not an unlawful private bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiffs, as real estate taxpayers of the City of New York affected by the exemption bestowed on defendant insurance company, have a sufficiently concrete aggrievment to bring this action against both the city and the State.  The fact that plaintiffs' economic stake is small and their tax rate not demonstrably affected, does not deprive them of standing to bring suit.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had requested that the county court dismiss the indictment against him after a delay of more than two years.

Defendant renewed his motion seven months later when the case was transferred to the Supreme Court of New York for trial. The court granted the motion, holding that the additional delay on top of the prior period of delay was presumptively prejudicial. The court said that the prior ruling could not be revisited, but based its decision on the period of additional delay since the prior court's ruling. The court applied a four-part test to determine if defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial had been violated, considering the length of delay, the reason for the delay, defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to defendant. The court found that for four months the case was not brought to trial although other cases were moved through the system in that time. Prejudice to defendant was found from the inability to resume his career due to the trial delay.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- right to speedy trial -- prosecutor's delay in bringing defendant's case to trial seven months after defendant first asserted his speedy trial rights, coupled with previous two-year delay in bringing defendant's case to trial, warrants dismissal of indictment; congestion of court calendars and priority given to jail cases over bail cases did not excuse prosecutor's failure to bring defendant's case to trial -- defendant, suspended police officer, was prejudiced by loss of opportunity to resume his job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A felony complaint was filed against defendant, a New York City police officer, in the City Court of New Rochelle on May 17, 1972.  Defendant was immediately suspended from duty by virtue of the criminal charges filed against him.  Defendant was indicted on September 26, 1972, arraigned in County Court on October 4, 1972 and then released on bail. Defendant's attorney served the District Attorney with written notice of an insanity defense on January 3, 1973.  Defendant's psychiatrist died before the case was to be tried.  On June 12, 1974, two years and one month after&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the criminal prosecution had been commenced, the County Court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds finding that there had been no undue delay and that the death of his psychiatrist caused no prejudice to defendant.  However, the prosecution's subsequent seven-month delay in bringing defendant's case to trial after he first asserted his speedy trial rights, coupled with the previous two-year delay, warrants a dismissal of the indictment. Congestion of court calendars and the priority given to the trial of jail cases over bail cases is not an acceptable excuse for the prosecution's failure to bring defendant's case to trial. The prosecutor failed to demonstrate that it would not have been possible to bring defendant to trial between June 12, 1974 and January 20, 1975, when the case was called in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The decision of the County Court that the death of defendant's psychiatrist did not impair his defense, is binding.  However, defendant has nevertheless been prejudiced by the delay.  Defendant's only chance to return to service with the police department was to exonerate himself in an early trial.  Defendant's chances for exoneration have grown slimmer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  because of the delay.  The loss of an opportunity to resume a career in law enforcement is prejudicial to defendant.  The remedy of absolute discharge is the only remedy that effectively protects the individual's right to a speedy trial. Accordingly, the indictment is dismissed, defendant is discharged and his bail is exonerated.  </SPAN></P>

The corporation sought to seize its utility meter from the premises rented by the customer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation supplied utility service to the customer, and when the customer failed to make payments for such service, the corporation notified the customer of the corporation's application for an order of seizure of the corporation's utility meter from the premises rented by the customer. The customer received the notice but failed to appear before the city court, and the order of seizure was issued. The customer filed a motion to vacate the order, and the city court held that the corporation's failure to allege a demand for the return of the meter and a refusal by the customer constituted a jurisdictional defect in the corporation's affidavit supporting its application for the order and such failure precluded the granting of the order. The corporation appealed, and the court reversed, holding that the customer had notice of the corporation's application for an order of seizure and an opportunity to be heard prior to the issuance of the order of seizure and thus, demand and refusal were not required in the corporation's application for the order under N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant customer, who is in arrears for the payment of gas and electric service, denied plaintiff public utility company access to meters located inside his premises.  Plaintiff, after giving defendant prior notice of its intention to apply for an order of seizure and an opportunity to be heard, properly obtained an order of seizure ( CPLR 7102) from the Rochester City Court directing the Sheriff to break open, enter defendant's premises and seize the meters. Defendant did not avail himself of the opportunity for a hearing.  Plaintiff's failure to allege, in the affidavit supporting the application for the order of seizure, that a demand&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for return of the meters was made and that defendant refused to honor the demand, does not constitute a jurisdictional defect precluding the granting of the order of seizure.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, racehorse owners and the Horseman's Benevolent Association, Inc (racehorse owners) brought an action against defendants, state officials charged with supervising thoroughbred horse racing, the New York Racing Association (NYRA), the Jockey Club, and various racing officials employed at NYRA tracks. Plaintiffs alleged that certain statutes and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The racehorse owners filed a complaint against state officials, NYRA, the Jockey Club, and various racing officials, alleging that, as a result of the enactment of various statutes, thoroughbred horse racing was conducted as a public enterprise whose conduct was delivered by the state into the hands of the racehorse owners' competitors who operated racing for their private benefit thereby depriving the racehorse owners equal protection of the laws. The court determined that the horseracing conducted by NYRA was not a governmental activity but that a &quot;symbiotic relationship&quot; existed as a result of the financial structure of NYRA so as to require equal protection of the laws. The court found that, although the racehorse owners were entitled to equal protection, the racehorse owners had failed to demonstrate that the difference in allocation of stall space resulted from other than reasonable business judgment exercised with the intention of attracting the best available horses. The court determined, however, that certain regulations allowing the Jockey Club to suspend a jockey or disqualify an owner were an unconstitutional delegation of the state's licensing authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the statutes creating NYRA were constitutional and that, although NYRA had a symbiotic relationship to the state and NYRA's actions, therefore, constituted state action, the racehorse owners were not denied equal protection because any discrimination was based on business judgments. The count determined, however, that certain regulations constituted an unconstitutional delegation of the state's licensing authority.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A lot owner in Manhattan was erecting an office building, but was limited to erecting 400,000 square feet of floor space, since the New York City Zoning Resolution limits the floor area and height to which a building can be erected, by the size of the lot and by the floor area ratio assigned to such a lot.  However, the &quot;Definitions&quot; section (&sect; 12-10) of the zoning resolution provides, in paragraph (c) of the (unnumbered) definition of a &quot;Zoning lot&quot;, that a &quot;single ownership&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is created when a lot owner acquires a lease of the adjoining lot &quot;of not less than 75 years duration&quot;.  Here, the adjoining lot (on which is a courthouse) was and is owned by the City of New York.  After negotiations and bidding, the city leased its lot and courthouse to this adjoining lot owner for 75 years at a rental averaging $ 46,000 a year; and the city took back a sublease, at no rental, for 74 years and 364 days, of its courthouse and of all air space or floor space above its courthouse exceeding 100,000 square feet in area.  Thus the city can, if it ever wishes, increase the height of its courthouse by the allowable square feet of floor space which exceed 100,000.  Meantime, the city will realize a profit consisting of about $ 46,000 a year rent plus additional real estate taxes of about $ 175,000 a year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, foster children, parents, and state agencies, filed an action pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 to compel respondent school district to permit the foster children residing within its jurisdiction to attend its school in the upcoming term. The school district had refused admittance to the foster children because it had not received tuition payment for the foster children's instruction pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3202(5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district refused to permit the foster children to attend school for the upcoming term because the school had not received tuition reimbursement payments. Section 3202(5) mandated that the cost of instruction should be borne by the school district in which the foster child resided at the time the social services district or state agency assumed responsibility for the foster child. The state agencies argued that the statute was unconstitutional. The court issued a declaratory judgment finding the statute constitutional because it did not create an invidious distinction between classes of citizens. The foster children were not denied a free public education. The statute merely allocated responsibility for payment of the foster children's tuition. The classification was found to be rational and it accomplished a legitimate state purpose. The court held that it would be unduly burdensome to require the school district to ascertain who was responsible for tuition payments. Therefore, the school district in which the foster child resided immediately prior to his transfer to the school district would be the body responsible for the tuition payment under the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a judgment declaring that the statute was constitutional, that all social services districts and state agencies were to forward tuition reimbursement, that no school district could refuse to admit any pupil because if its failure to receive reimbursement, and that the school district in which each foster child resided immediately prior to his transfer was responsible for the child's tuition costs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent, a small and rural school district without a large school tax base, is ordered to permit petitioners, 56 foster children, to attend school within the district.  Petitioners had resided in a variety of school districts prior to their placement in foster homes within respondent school district by outside social services districts or State agencies.  Subdivision 5 of section 3202 of the Education Law, which places liability for tuition costs of foster children upon the school district&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of residence at the time the child came into the care of a social services district, is not unconstitutional.  However, the school district of present residence should not have the burden of ascertaining the responsible district or agency.  Accordingly, a presumption should be read into the statute that, unless another school district, social services district, State department or State agency has assumed responsibility for tuition payment, the school district in which the child resided immediately prior to his transfer to the school district of present residence is the body responsible for the tuition payment under subdivision 5 of section 3202.  The school district of residence immediately prior to the transfer to the district of present residence may in turn seek redress against the school district in which the pupil resided at the time the social services district or State agency assumed responsibility for his support.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff owner leased an aircraft to defendant lessee pursuant to an agreement which both authorized and required defendant lessee to furnish normal repairs and services to the aircraft. When defendant lessee defaulted under the lease, plaintiff demanded return of the aircraft which was located at the Westchester County Airport in the possession&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of defendants, aircraft service and leasing corporations.  However, defendant corporations validly asserted garagemen's liens pursuant to section 184 of the Lien Law totaling $ 80,000 or services performed and fuel supplied to the aircraft at the request of defendant lessee and were therefore lawfully entitled to maintain possession of the aircraft. Section 184, which provides that a garageman who &quot;stores, maintains, keeps or repairs any * * * aircraft of furnishes gasoline or other supplies therefore at the request or with the consent of the owner * * * has a lien upon such * * * aircraft for the sum for such storing * * * and may detain such * * * aircraft at any time it may be lawfully in his possession until such sum is paid&quot;, does not unconstitutionally deprive plaintiff of possession of the aircraft without due process of law. Defendants at no time arbitrarily seized plaintiff's property.  Rather they retained possession which was voluntarily surrendered to them.  The lawful State action under the statute is the granting of a lien to the garageman in possession for work done on the aircraft surrendered. A garageman performs services and does repairs to the very item on which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he asserts a lien.  Thus the obligation for which he seeks to maintain possession arises out of the work done to the aircraft and does not involve the seizure and holding of property to secure the payment of services rendered to an individual (cf.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Blye v Globe-Wernicke Realty Co</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 33 NY2d 15).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 184 has been applied in a constitutional manner.  Plaintiff both authorized and required defendant lessee to service and repair the aircraft. Therefore, it must be deemed to have impliedly consented to the work performed by defendant lienors. </SPAN></P>

The court denied removal because defendant would receive a fair trial since a different town justice had been elected to the town court, the case did not present any far-reaching results that would present or become a precedent, the case did not present questions that were beyond the town justice's comprehension, defendant would not be deprived of his property without due process, and the laws allowing operation of the town courts were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Section 44-8 did not violate the First Amendment because although dancing was a form of expression protected by the First Amendment, the city could proscribe expression that was directed toward an end that it declared to be illegal. Further, nude dancing was a proper subject of the state's police power. Defendants' due process rights to earn a livelihood were not violated because nude dancing was a form of illegal activity not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The ordinance had a substantial relation to matters within the field where legislative power was vested and it was reasonably calculated to achieve a legitimate purpose.

Said ordinance which prohibits a person from appearing &quot;in a state of nudity * * * in a street or public place where others are present&quot;, is not unconstitutional for vagueness. Nightclubs, cocktail lounges and similar establishments, by virtue of their accessibility to the public, fall within the statutory definition of a &quot;public place&quot; (Penal Law, &sect; 240.00, subd 1).

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York City Stabilization Reserve Corporation Act (SRCA) (Public Authorities Law, tit. 26, as added by L. 1974, ch. 594), established the Stabilization Reserve Corporation (SRC) as a public benefit corporation to assist the City of New York in providing essential services on a sound financial basis during a period of fiscal crisis (Public Authorities Law, &sect; 2533.) The SRC is authorized to sell its own bonds and notes and to pay over the sale proceeds to the city Comptroller for deposit in the city's general fund (&sect; 2536).  The bonds and notes are SRC obligations payable solely from SRC&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  revenues (&sect; 2542).  The payment of the principal of the notes is to be made out of the capital reserve fund which is to be maintained by the city provided that it first appropriates funds for such purpose (&sect; 2537, subd. 1, par. [a]).  The city is to pay the operating expenses and debt services of the SRC within the appropriations available (&sect; 2540, subd. [a]).  If the city does not make such appropriations, the State maintains the fund out of State aid to New York City funds.  Plaintiff's taxpayer's suit is dismissed.  The bonds and notes of the SRC are not debts of the City of New York; therefore, the city has not pledged its credit as security for the obligations of a public corporation in violation of section 5 of article X of the State Constitution, or failed to pledge its faith and credit for its debt in violation of article VIII of the State Constitution.  The payments from the city or the State are permissive and not mandatory regardless of the practical or moral obligation of the city to make the necessary appropriations. The money can only be provided by the city if it is appropriated out of current revenues.  The city is not authorized to issue its own obligations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to maintain the SRC fund nor is it the guarantor of the SRC notes and bonds.  The contingent obligation of the city does not constitute a debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff, as a taxpayer, has standing under section 51 of the General Municipal Law to challenge the expenditure of municipal funds and need not demonstrate any individual interest. </SPAN></P>

The court accepted jurisdiction over the case. The court held that: (1) although the Supreme Court of New York could have taken concurrent jurisdiction over the contract claim, in its discretion, if the executors had resorted to the supreme court, it would be patently unconstitutional for the legislature to forbid exercise of jurisdiction by the surrogate's court over such obviously surrogate's business as the probate of wills; (2) jurisdiction in discovery had been assumed in the surrogate's court even though debts and contract obligations might be involved.</SPAN></P>

Women comprise a significant portion of petit jury and Grand Jury venires in Dutchess County thus refuting any contention that such bodies &quot;are almost entirely male&quot;.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner applicant filed a petition initiating proceedings pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 seeking to compel respondents, the commissioner of the public works department and the chairman of the department's license board, to issue him a master electrician's license. The license board had recommended that issuance of the license should be denied, and the commissioner had denied issuance of the license for lack of candor for failure to disclose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When he was 16 years old, an applicant enlisted in the merchant marine and received an honorable discharge. Thereafter, he enlisted in the army and re-enlisted in the merchant marine and served honorably. Twenty-eight years later, he filed an application for a master electrician's license. The license board recommended issuance thereof should be approved, subject to receipt of the applicant's fingerprints. The applicant later contacted the chairman informing him of an incident in the army for which he was arrested but not charged. The board then recommended denial of a license, and the commissioner denied issuance of the license for lack of candor in failing to disclose. The applicant then initiated proceedings under art. 78 to compel the chairman and the commissioner to issue the license. The court held that: (1) the applicant's action in bringing the matter to the board's attention before the fingerprint record was received, strongly demonstrated lack of deliberate intent to conceal or suppress the incident; and (2) it was not in the interest of justice to deny him the means of making a livelihood in his chosen profession because of the action taken by him in his youth.</SPAN></P>

Respondent commissioner received a fingerprint record indicating that defendant was arrested by the F.B.I. in 1947 for larceny and received one year.  However, there is no evidence that petitioner was ever formally arrested for gun running or that he ever served time for the commission of a Federal offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with unloading a barge containing gasoline without using a floating boom of sufficient length to contain the barge in violation of Art. III, &sect; 3.4(D)(IV) of the Nassau County Fire Prevention Ordinance. At the conclusion of trial, defendant moved for an order of dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant unloaded a barge containing gasoline without using a floating boom of sufficient length to contain the barge, and it did not request an exception to boom. Defendant contended, inter alia, that the ordinance was an unconstitutional exercise of police power because the booming of barges discharging gasoline, as opposed to kerosene, diesel oil, or fuel oil, actually enhanced the risk of fire and that therefore, booming was unnecessary to accomplish the purpose of the ordinance. Although the court opined that the ordinance needed revision, it declined to declare the ordinance void because debatable questions as to reasonableness were for the legislature and not for the courts. Expert testimony established that even a small spill would be subject to ignition over an area of 600 to 800 feet for a period of 15 to 20 minutes, and the court found that the ordinance, to a certain extent, fulfilled its purpose as a safety measure. The court also held that the county had jurisdiction over its contiguous waterways, and it declined to review the constitutionality of the ordinance's exception clause because it would not be dispositive of the issue before the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion for dismissal and found it guilty of violating the ordinance requiring booming of its barge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Waters and watercourses -- navigable and tidal waters of Nassau County -- booming of gasoline barges -- defendant corporation is guilty of unloading barge containing gasoline without using floating boom in violation of Nassau County Fire Prevention Ordinance; Nassau County has right to regulate its abutting navigable and tidal waters -- ordinance which requires booming of barges except &quot;whenever certain conditions would render it impractical or ineffective&quot;, does not deny defendant equal protection of law for failure to set forth proper guidelines -- fact that need to boom gasoline is debatable is not sufficient to render ordinance void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant corporation is guilty of unloading a barge containing gasoline without using a floating boom of sufficient length to contain the barge in violation of section 3.4 of article III of the Nassau County Fire Prevention Ordinance. The Nassau County Fire Marshal has jurisdiction over the waters contiguous to Nassau County.  The State Legislature, by not including &quot;all tidewaters bordering on and lying within the boundaries&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Nassau and Suffolk counties&quot; within the definition of navigable waters of the State ( Navigation Law, &sect; 2, subd 4), either expressly or impliedly conferred upon Nassau County the right to regulate its abutting navigable and tidal waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The ordinance, which requires a floating boom to be positioned &quot;prior to discharge of any flammable or combustible liquid from any boat, barge or vessel&quot;, except whenever the Fire Marshal determines that &quot;certain conditions&quot; would render such positioning &quot;impractical or ineffective&quot;, does not deny defendant equal protection of the law for failure to set forth proper guidelines for the determination of the Fire Marshal. Since striking the &quot;exception&quot; clause would leave a complete constitutional act requiring booming at all times and under all conditions, there is no need to decide whether the &quot;exception&quot; clause is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant has not shown that the required booming of barges discharging gasoline imposes unusual and unnecessary restrictions on its business.  The fact that the need to boom gasoline is debatable, necessitating a review and revision of the ordinance, is not sufficient to render said ordinance void as an unconstitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  exercise of police power. Defendant has not overcome the presumption of reasonableness which attaches to the ordinance. The ordinance does, to some extent, fulfill its purpose as a safety measure.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grand jury was impaneled to investigate allegations of ongoing organized crime. Two witnesses raised objections to the nature of the questions and the authority of the prosecutor. The witnesses also filed motions to suppress testimony and to quash their subpoenas. The reviewing court denied the witnesses' motions and ordered them to answer the questions posed by the prosecutor. The court determined that the arguments to quash the subpoenas were without merit as the grand jury had a right to the testimony of these witnesses because they were associated, directly or indirectly, with the businesses and persons under investigation. The court determined that because the witnesses failed to sustain their burden of demonstrating any bad faith or patent invalidity in the grand jury investigation the court would not review challenges to the grand jury's authority until it had acted as dictated by N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to three counts in three indictments that included two class A-III felony counts. The prosecutor refused to recommend that the court sentence defendant to a period of probation on the ground that she had not been of sufficient material assistance in the investigation, apprehension, or prosecution of a person charged with drug violations. He also refused to accept what defendant had to offer. Defendant sought a declaration that &sect; 65.00(1)(b) was unconstitutional and a hearing on the prosecutor's refusal to recommend lifetime probation. The court held that &sect; 65.00(1)(b) was constitutional under due process and equal protection measures, that it was not vague, and that it sufficiently set forth the requirements for a recommendation of probation based on material assistance to the prosecution. The court denied defendant's request for a hearing because the prosecutor, as a court officer, was vested with wide discretion that would not be disturbed in the absence of evidence of the arbitrary or improper use of that discretion. The court noted that the existence of a potential for a recommendation of probation was not a guarantee that it would be forthcoming.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 65.00 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Penal Law which permits a sentence of probation to be imposed for a class A-III drug felony if the prosecutor so recommends upon a finding that defendant has provided &quot;material assistance&quot; in the investigation, apprehension or prosecution of a person charged with a narcotics violation (Penal Law, art 220), sufficiently sets forth what is required to procure a recommendation of lifetime probation from a District Attorney and is therefore constitutional.</SPAN></P>

A statute should not be set aside as unconstitutional by a court of original jurisdiction unless such conclusion is inescapable and the invalidity of the act is apparent on its face.</SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 5017(a) for an entry of a judgment in favor of plaintiff. Plaintiff then sought to vacate the judgment. The court held that: (1) although either party could move for an entry of judgment, regardless of whether a party had prevailed in the action, the court had inherent power to set aside the entry of judgment in the interest of substantial justice because defendant's use of such judgment was to thwart plaintiff's substantive right to an order of arrest and the court's judicial prerogative to render a decision on the motion; (2) there was no rational or reasonable basis for the sex-based classification of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss an indictment charging him with crimes stemming from his and other tribal members' forceful removal of non-Native American families from the reservation. Defendant argued that the indictment was insufficient, that jurisdiction and venue were improper, that state and federal laws were invalid, that the grand jury was prejudiced, and that he was immune from arrest and prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a member of a Native American tribe on a reservation. Defendant and other tribe members decided to remove white people living on the reservation. The tribe passed a law to bar non-Native Americans and served removal notices on them. Although it was determined that the state would effect the removal, defendant and others physically removed families of non-Native Americans. That action, and threats and forceful entries, resulted in an indictment against six Native Americans. Defendant appeared, was arraigned, and filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. The court denied the motion, holding that the indictment was proper, as was jurisdiction and venue. 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 232 was constitutional, and the allegations in the indictment were within N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 135, 140. The grand jury's composition from voter registration lists did not violate defendant's Fourteenth Amendment rights. Defendant was not prejudiced by adverse publicity in the local media, and defendant failed to comply with N.Y. Indian Law &sect; 8. Defendant was not immune from arrest and prosecution even though he was acting on the mandate of his counsel of chiefs in evicting intruders from the reservation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss an indictment against him for various crimes stemming from his and other members of his tribe's forceful removal of non-Native American families from the reservation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After the Council of Chiefs of the Onondaga Nation passed a law to bar all non-Indians from the Onondaga Indian Reservation, which is located entirely in Onondaga County, warriors and others proceeded to physically remove the non-Indians, allegedly making threats and forcible entries which resulted in the indictment of six individuals.  It was thereafter agreed that, of those six, the present defendant would appear and be arraigned, and the points raised by him in support of dismissal of the indictments would be considered.  After consideration of those points, the motion to dismiss is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The indictments allege facts which fall within the provisions of articles 135 and 140 of the Penal Law, and they comply with CPL 200.50 (subd. 7), requiring that an indictment contain a plain and concise factual statement in each count which asserts facts supporting every element of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  offense charged and defendant's commission thereof with sufficient precision to clearly apprise him of the conduct which is the subject of the accusation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. As to claimed lack of jurisdiction, section 232 of title 25 of the United States Code vests in the State of New York jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against Indians on Indian reservations within the State.  As to claimed improper venue, section 8 of the New York Indian Law vests jurisdiction over disputes arising from intrusions on tribal lands in the County Judge of the county in which those lands are situated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Section 232 of title 25 of the United States Code is constitutional.  Congress may constitutionally enact legislation controlling the affairs of Indians, with or without their consent, and, in the exercise of that power, may lawfully delegate a portion of that control to the States, including the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over crimes committed on Indian reservations by Indians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The use of voter registration lists to select possible grand jurors is constitutionally permissible, and, if, as has been alleged, Indians do not choose to vote, they are not being unconstitutionally discriminated against&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  when their nonvoting excludes them from grand jury panels.  Nor has there been a showing of systematic exclusion from grand jury service of Indians because of their race.  They may not only register to vote to avail themselves of the opportunity to be chosen as jurors, but they may respond to the invitations, issued to the general public in various ways, such as in newspapers and on television, to sign up for jury duty. And, under the jury selection process, there is no way of knowing the race or color of those whose names are on the master list of prospective jurors or of those whose names are drawn from that list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. There has been no showing that news coverage of the events involved in this case was such as to make the Grand Jury biased and prejudiced against defendant, but merely a conclusory allegation as to bias and prejudice without any factual support therefor and without specific reference to particular news articles from which a logical inference of prejudice could be drawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Under section 8 of the Indian Law, complaints about intruders on tribal lands may be made to the County Judge or a request may be made to the District Attorney by a majority of the Chiefs of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Onondaga Nation and, upon such request, the District Attorney shall make complaint as to any intrusions, and cause the intruders to be removed.  Defendant did not comply with the statute in either of the two manners provided, and, therefore, cannot claim that the District Attorney should not have appeared before the Grand Jury because he had possessed the authority to evict the intruders and failed to do so.  Moreover, under CPL 190.55, the District Attorney of the county, or his assistants, must present the evidence to the Grand Jury relating to any crimes allegedly committed within the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The fact that defendant was evicting intruders pursuant to mandates of the Council of Chiefs does not immunize him from arrest.  While the Indians have a right to govern their internal affairs, and, in doing so, may designate who is an intruder, the act of evicting those intruders goes beyond the concept of self-government and into an area which Congress and the State Legislature have pre-empted in order to avoid injury to person and property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Questions as to defendant's mental state or culpability, including his intent, and all other aspects of his conduct as it relates to the elements&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the crimes charged, are matters to be raised at the trial.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that &sect; 250.20 was amended in response to the United States Supreme Court's decision that invalidated an Oregon &quot;notice of alibi&quot; statute on the ground that it did not provide for reciprocal discovery. The court found that the New York statute was patterned on a Florida statute that withstood an attack before the United States Supreme Court. Section 250.20(2) provided that within a reasonable time after receipt of defendant's witness list but not later than 10 days before trial, the People had to serve upon defendant or his counsel a list of the witnesses the People proposed to offer in rebuttal to discredit defendant's alibi. The court found that the only essential difference from the Florida statute was the inclusion in &sect; 250.20(2) that a witness who would testify that defendant was at the scene of the crime was not such an alibi rebuttal witness. However, the court concluded that this distinction did not affect the statute's constitutionality, for such disclosure was not intended to reveal eyewitnesses to the crime.

The fact that CPL 250.20 (subd 2) provides that a &quot;witness who will testify that defendant was at the scene of the crime is not such an alibi rebuttal witness&quot; does not affect the statute's constitutionality since the disclosure of alibi rebuttal witnesses was not intended to reveal eyewitnesses to the crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in an automobile accident and was found sitting behind the wheel of the car when an officer came to investigate. Before the officer noticed defendant's slurred speech and staggered walk, defendant admitted to the officer that he was driving at the time of the accident. Defendant was ultimately arrested and given a breathalyzer test that indicated a blood alcohol content of .21. Defendant filed a motion to suppress his admission that he was driving because it occurred prior to the giving of Miranda warnings. The court denied that motion and held that where the officer was asking general questions about the accident, such warnings were not required. The court also found defendant guilty of driving while impaired, a traffic infraction, rather than driving while intoxicated. The court determined that the intoxication statute,&nbsp;N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Driving while &quot;ability * * * is impaired&quot; ( Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 1192, subd 1) is only a traffic infraction.

The difference between &quot;impaired&quot; and &quot;intoxicated&quot; is too vague to be enforceable with justice.  Therefore, subdivision 3, on account of which defendant was arrested and charged, is unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The provisions of subdivision 4 of section 209 of the Civil Service Law which mandate binding arbitration of wage disputes between a municipality and its duly organized fire and police forces are constitutional and valid.  The statute requires that disputes which cannot be resolved through&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  negotiation or mediation be referred to a three-member </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">ad hoc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arbitration panel ( Civil Service Law, &sect; 209, subd. 4, par. [c]) whose members are selected by the parties and the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB).  The determination of the panel is made &quot;final and binding on the parties&quot;.  Although the Municipal Home Rule Law and State Constitution recognize the right of municipalities to govern their own affairs and determine the compensation and conditions of employment of their employees, the procedures for the resolution of disputes between local governments and their municipal police and fire forces are appropriate subjects for State legislation since such disputes involve the health, safety and well-being of the State's populace which are clearly matters of State concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The delegation of authority to the arbitration panel is not such a total delegation of legislative discretion and authority as would render the statute invalid. The power of the panel is strictly limited and the reasonable and precise standards and guidelines to which the panel must adhere are set out in express detail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The statute, which proscribes review of the panel's determination by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any local legislative body or municipal authority ( Civil Service Law, &sect; 209, subd. 4, par. [a], cl. [vi]), does not violate constitutional due process since such determination must be deemed subject to judicial review. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment against her on the basis that the statutes upon which the charges were founded were unconstitutional. The indictment charged defendant with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold over an ounce of a substance containing 30 milligrams of methadone to an undercover officer, and she was charged with three counts, counts one and two related to the possession and sale of a substance based on aggregate weight and count three related to possession with intent to sell regardless of weight. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment and claimed that it was unconstitutional to hold her criminally liable based on the aggregate weight of the material sold. The court granted defendant's motion to dismiss counts one and two of the indictment and held that the N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 220.43 and 220.18 were unconstitutional to the extent they treated the sale and possession of methadone in an aggregate weight of one ounce or more as class A-I and A-II felonies. The court found that there was no rational basis for treating 30 milligrams of therapeutic methadone with the same degree of criminality and sanction as the same weight of more potent, illicit narcotics possessed or sold in dosage quantities at least one hundred times as great. The court held that the third count of the indictment was not unconstitutional because it was not based on weight.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the third count of the indictment, granted defendant's motion to dismiss the first and second counts of the indictment, and held that N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 220.43 and 220.18(1)were unconstitutional to the extent that they treated the sale and possession of methadone in an aggregate weight of one ounce or more as class A-I and A-II felonies, respectively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- controlled substances -- sale and possession of merely therapeutic diluted dose of methadone cannot constitutionally be classified as class A-I and class A-II felonies punishable by maximum of life imprisonment -- accordingly, counts of indictment (under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Penal Law, &sect; 220.43</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">&sect; 220.18</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 1) are dismissed -- People may resubmit those counts as sale of controlled substance in third degree and as possession of controlled substance in seventh degree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant appears to be a former narcotic addict who is now receiving, from a methadone maintenance clinic, take-home therapeutic doses consisting of a little more than one ounce of orange juice in which there are mixed and diluted merely 30 milligrams of methadone plus a few grains of filler and binder.  She allegedly sold one of her therapeutic doses to an undercover policeman.  Such a diluted therapeutic dose might well be classified as a &quot;narcotic preparation&quot;, rather than as a &quot;narcotic drug&quot; from which over 100 narcotic doses can be made from the same quantity (cf. Penal Law, &sect; 220.00, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  subds. 7, 8; Public Health Law, &sect; 3306).  Certainly, to the extent that the Penal Law ( &sect; 220.43; &sect; 220.18, subd. 1) classifies the sale and possession of a mere therapeutic dose of methadone as a class A-I and a class A-II felony respectively, punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment (Penal Law, &sect; 70.00, subds. 2, 3), the statutes contravene constitutional principles of due process and equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Accordingly, the first two counts of this indictment (under Penal Law, &sect; 220.43 and &sect; 220.18, subd. 1) are dismissed, but not the third count (under Penal Law, &sect; 220.16, subd. 1).  The People may resubmit the first two counts as a sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (Penal Law, &sect; 220.16) or a lesser included offense, and as possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree (Penal Law, &sect; 220.03), respectively.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a village mayor and trustees, brought an action against defendants, a state commissioner and comptroller, for a declaration that the &quot;additional city apportionment&quot; provisions of N.Y State Fin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Other than the addition of an allegation that &sect; 54 violated the state constitution, the complaint by the mayor and trustees raised the same issues asserted in a previous action in the federal court, which was dismissed. The mayor and trustees asserted that &sect; 54, which granted more state aid proportionately to cities than to villages abridged their privileges and immunities, deprived them of due process, and denied them equal protection. The court dismissed the complaint. The court held that res judicata barred the complaint at least insofar as alleged violations of the Federal Constitution. The court noted that while the federal court dismissed on the ground of failure to present a federal question, it did so only after finding each of the arguments for the village utterly lacking in legal substance. The court held that the federal ruling addressing identical equal protection language in the Federal Constitution was not dispositive, but was highly persuasive on the state constitutional claim. The court adopted the federal court's view that cities bear greater statutory burdens and costs, thus the distinction drawn by the Legislature was rational.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The action commenced by plaintiffs, the Mayor and Trustees of the Village of Lynbrook, challenging the constitutionality under the Federal Constitution, of the additional State aid city apportionment provisions of section 54 of the State Finance Law, is barred by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since the same claim brought by plaintiffs against the same defendants was dismissed in a prior Federal action upon the ground that plaintiffs failed to present a substantial Federal question.  The fundamental principle underlying the doctrine of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is that, in the public interest, a party shall not be heard a second time on an issue which has been settled previously by litigation between the same parties before a court of competent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jurisdiction.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiffs' claim that section 54 deprived them of equal protection of the laws under the State Constitution (art I, &sect; 11) is dismissed.  Federal decisions in cases of this kind are of highly persuasive effect as authorities in State courts, and only rarely will a statute held by the Federal courts not to be in conflict with the Federal Constitution fail to survive a State court test against a similar constitutional provision. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original action respondent state tax commission challenged an original order fixing the tax on a decedent's gross estate. The matter was argued orally before a surrogate and submitted for decision. Petitioner executor had filed the estate's return, upon which a federal audit was conducted, and had deducted certain of the decedent's securities of two Canadian corporations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original order was marked &quot;Subject to Federal audit&quot; on its face. The commission contended that the Canadian securities were assets of the decedent constituting intangible personal property includable in the New York gross estate and therefore fully taxable. The executor contended that Canada created a situs for the securities and the United States recognized such Canadian jurisdiction over shares of stock. Therefore, the executor argued, the securities should have been treated in New York as tangible personal property of the decedent located outside New York and thereby excluded from the New York gross estate, pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 956(a). The court held that: (1) the final federal determination had a binding effect upon the commission, pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 961; (2) deductions were matters of legislative grace and the executor failed to show that the deduction was clearly allowed; and (3) the decedent's Canadian stocks constituted intangible personal property as a matter of New York law and were thereby includable and taxable in his New York gross estate without regard to Canadian tax law and without any foreign death tax credit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended its supplemental order to include the Canadian securities at the values fixed in the final federal determination.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Decedent was a New York resident whose tax was fixed by order, at $ 99,450 on a gross estate of $ 1,541,819.  The order was marked &quot;Subject to Federal audit&quot;.  The New York State Tax Commission filed a notice of appeal and objected to the exclusion from decedent's gross estate of certain securities of two Canadian corporations, which had been included in decedent's Federal gross estate by the Internal Revenue Service.  The final Federal determination set the value of the securities at $ 27,731.25 which determination is binding upon the tax commission ( Tax Law, &sect; 961).  Although Canada&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  also imposed a tax on the transfer of the securities upon decedent's death, which results in the multiple taxation by different jurisdictions of decedent's intangible personal property, the Canadian stocks constitute intangible personal property as a matter of New York law and are thereby includable and taxable in decedent's New York gross estate without regard to Canadian tax law. New York cannot change or adjust the imposition of the tax law of a foreign sovereignty which defines and taxes intangible personal property of a nonresident differently than New York does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The omission by New York from its tax law of any credit for a foreign death tax is not unconstitutional.  New York taxes only the real property and tangible personal property of nonresidents situated in New York over which New York has exclusive jurisdiction, and therefore does not grant credits for foreign death taxes ( Tax Law, &sect; 249-p).  The rule regarding reciprocity of exemptions from certain death taxes between the States ( Tax Law, &sect; 249-p-A) has no effect upon the imposition of Canadian tax law against the estate of decedent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The appeal was properly noticed within 60 days from the original order ( Tax&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Law, &sect; 249-x), and the grounds upon which the appeal was taken were properly stated.  In any event, the tax commission has the right to move for a supplemental determination in respect to any increase in the taxable estate resulting from the Federal audit and final determination ( Tax Law, &sect; 962).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Accordingly, the supplemental order should be amended to include the Canadian securities at the values fixed in the final Federal determination.  </SPAN></P>

Law &sect; 599, women were granted an automatic exemption from jury service if even they were qualified as jurors. Defendant filed a motion to challenge the panel from which his jury was to be chosen, and argued that the automatic exemption violated his due process and equal protection rights because he would not receive a jury drawn from a panel representing a fair cross-section of the community. The court granted the motion. The court held that the Sixth Amendment mandated that a jury be drawn from a pool which reflected a fair cross-section of the community. After reviewing statistics from the clerk's office, the court confirmed that women were substantially underrepresented on juries in relation to the proportion of women in the population.

It is constitutionally mandated that juries be drawn from panels which reflect a representative cross section of the community, and, although the Judiciary Law makes it easier for women to serve as jurors than does the Louisiana statute declared unconstitutional in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Taylor </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Louisiana</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (419 U.S. 522), women are nevertheless substantially underrepresented in proportion to their actual&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  numbers in the population.  Such underrepresentation would deprive the defendant of his right under the Sixth Amendment to an impartial jury trial.  Since the statutory classification solely on the basis of sex is inherently suspect and deals with fundamental rights, it is subject to strict scrutiny requiring a showing of a compelling State interest to justify its use under the equal protection clause. The only possible such interest is that the care of young children would be neglected if women were required to serve on juries, a view totally without foundation and an interest which could have been achieved by a grant of an exemption to persons actually occupied in the care of young children. The historical justification for relegating women to an inferior status, based upon a rigid and empirically unsupported view of a single societal role, is no longer valid or acceptable, and the State has not met its burden.  Since the consequences will be severe and the damage irreparable if the defendant must risk his liberty by being tried by a jury drawn from a panel not conforming to constitutional requirements, the court should not hesitate to determine the constitutionality of the statute.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

Noting that defendant failed to brief or support his argument even though he had the burden of demonstrating the statute's invalidity, the court held that &sect; 220.09(10) did not violate defendant's equal protection rights because the placement of marijuana in the same schedule with heroin and other opium derivatives was not a controlling factor in the scheme of punishment for marijuana possession.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 10 of section 220.09 of the Penal Law, criminal possession of a controlled substance (marijuana) in the fifth degree, is not unconstitutional.  In proscribing the sale, possession and distribution of marijuana, the Penal Law has not classed marijuana with various narcotic drugs in violation of defendant's due process and equal protection rights since marijuana has been removed from the narcotic drug category.

Grouping marijuana in the same schedule with heroin and other opium derivatives which are generally thought to be more dangerous or harmful (Public Health Law, &sect; 3306, Schedule I), does not deprive defendant of equal protection since such grouping is not a controlling factor in the scheme of punishment for marijuana violations.  Punishment for marijuana violations is treated differently from the punishment for violations involving other more dangerous drugs.  While conviction under any of the first nine subdivisions of section 220.09 requires imposition of a prison sentence pursuant to subdivision 3 of section 60.05 of the Penal Law, a marijuana possession conviction under subdivisions 10 and 11 of section 220.09 need not result in a prison sentence.

Petitioners, Suffolk County Legislature and its appointee, sought to prohibit respondent governor from appointing the legislator pursuant to N.Y. County Law &sect; 400(7).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor's appointee argued that the county charter was unconstitutional and ultra vires since it conflicted with N.Y.

The court ruled in favor of the legislature's appointee, holding that &sect; 400(7) was not a general law because it did not apply to all counties. The court found it particularly noteworthy that neither the County Law nor the Public Officers Law was included among the chapters which &quot;charter&quot; counties were prohibited from superseding by N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 34. Moreover, there was no express statement in N.Y. County Law &sect; 400 that it was to be superior to any alternate county government law. The court concluded that the legislative grant of power contained in N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 was properly effectuated by the legislature through N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 33 and that &sect; 206 of the Suffolk County Charter was duly enacted pursuant to the power conferred upon the county by N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 33(2).

Subdivision 7 of section 400 of the County Law which provides that &quot;a vacancy in an elective county office, shall be filled by the governor by appointment&quot;, is not a general law of the State and is therefore not controlling over the provisions of the Suffolk County Charter. Section 206 was duly enacted pursuant to the power conferred upon the county by subdivision 2 of section 33 of the Municipal Home Rule Law.

The landlords sought a declaratory judgment that the Declaration was invalid, illegal, and unconstitutional.

The ETPA authorized the city to issue the declaration if the vacancy rate for the housing accommodations within the municipality were not in excess of five percent. The court held that the city council's resolution was a legislative act. The court held that the ETPA's delegation of power to the local unit of government was plainly constitutional. The legislature could pass a statute that conferred rights upon a restricted locality but became operative only in the event of an affirmative vote.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The recipient was past due on her payments to the power company. The power company had turned her power off, but then turned it on again. The recipient applied for emergency assistance pursuant to N.Y. Soc. Serv.

The county and state objected to the requested relief, and argued that the recipient had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. The court granted the recipient's petition to the extent of requiring the county to meet the recipient's immediate emergency need to pay the power company, and otherwise denied the petition. The court held that to require the recipient to exhaust her administrative remedies would have rendered the issue moot. The court held that the state had a duty to care for the needy. N.Y. Const. art. 17, &sect; 1. The court held that the loss of electrical power constituted an emergency pursuant to &sect; 13-a(6).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Organized Crime Task Force (OCTF) commenced an investigation into alleged criminal activity in connection with a municipal sewer construction project pursuant to N.Y.

Defendants were charged in a 57-count indictment, including charges of conspiracy, perjury and tempering with evidence. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the indictments, which the court granted. The court held that N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 70-a was unconstitutional on its face and as applied. The court ruled that the Act was unconstitutionally vague because it granted almost unlimited authority to the OCTF to investigate organized crime activities in two or more counties without defining &quot;organized crime.&quot; The court held that the Act violated defendants' Fourth Amendment rights by authorizing the OCTF to subpoena witnesses and evidence without showing that it was relevant or necessary to its investigation. The court further ruled that the Act violated defendants' due process rights because the OCTF was not required to inform them of the nature of the investigation before they were questioned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 70-a of the Executive Law is too vague to be constitutional, either as worded or as applied in this case.

The court held that &sect; 130.38 and &sect; 130.00 as it was encompassed by &sect; 130.38 were unconstitutional. The court found that if inquiry into or regulation of a married person's sexual conduct was an invasion of the right to privacy, then inquiry into or regulation of a single person's sexual conduct was equally violative of the right to privacy. The court could not find what overriding or compelling state interest the legislature sought to protect by enacting &sect; 130.38.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A town filed an action against a local dairy for two violations of Islip, N.Y., Town Code &sect; 35-2(L), the town's anti-noise ordinance. The dairy filed a motion to dismiss and argued that the ordinance was void for vagueness, unconstitutional, and unenforceable. The court explained that, like a statute, an ordinance was presumed to be valid and constitutional. The dairy had the burden to prove that the ordinance was void for vagueness. To determine that issue, the court considered whether the ordinance stated with sufficient clarity the rule to be obeyed, such that a reasonable person would be informed about the nature of the offense and about what the ordinance required. In this case, the ordinance declared that the operation of any machinery, equipment, pump, fan, exhaust fan, attic fan, air-conditioning apparatus or similar mechanical device, in such a manner as to create any unreasonable or unnecessary noise of unreasonable extent and duration, was prohibited.The court compared similar ordinances that had been upheld, found that this ordinance was constitutional, denied the dairy's motion to dismiss, and ordered that the matter proceed to trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant is charged in two separate complaints with violations of the anti-noise ordinance of the Islip Town Code ( &sect; 35-2, subd. L).  Said ordinance which prohibits the operation of various mechanical devices &quot;in such a manner as to create any unreasonable or unnecessary noise of such unreasonable extent and duration&quot;, is not unconstitutional.  In dealing with noise problems at this time, a more objective standard could not be reached.  The use of a decibel level standard as suggested by defendant would be a useless and inefficient standard.  The standard set up by the ordinance can fairly be interpreted by a &quot;reasonable man&quot; and is therefore not unconstitutional for vagueness. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss the accusatory instruments is denied and the matter will proceed to trial. </SPAN></P>

The gravamen of plaintiff's complaint was that defendant's magazine, in an advertising campaign, used photographs of plaintiff in 10 advertisements to promote subscriptions. Moreover, plaintiff asserted that defendant's advertisement was not an incidental use but became a collateral use with the passing of time. The court found that so long as the reproductions were used to illustrate the quality and content of the periodical in which it originally appeared, the statute was not violated, albeit the reproduction appeared in other media for purposes of advertising the periodical. The court found it commendable that under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff City sought a judgment against defendant State declaring &sect; 131 of the Pari-Mutuel Revenue Law, 1940 N.Y. Laws ch. 254, &sect; 131, as amended by 1974 N.Y. Laws ch. 439, &sect; 1, to be inapplicable to the City, or, if not, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The relief requested was based on the theory that the enactment was an unconstitutional delegation of the State's taxing power in violation of N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 1, and permitted another city, the only city qualifying under the act, to tax beyond its territorial jurisdiction. It was further alleged that &sect; 131 was incapable of compliance because of ambiguity and vagueness. The City impliedly, at least, urged that it was not a State statute that was being attacked but a law enacted by the other city, which had no right whatever to surcharge or tax the City disputing the legislation. The court disagreed with the City's position and ruled that the law in question was enacted by the State, not by the other city. When the non-party city passed the local law, that passage triggered the operation of &sect; 131 state-wide. The court further held that &sect; 131 was constitutional because the City failed to meet the heavy burden to demonstrate its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court directed judgment in favor of the State declaring the &sect; 131 constitutional and valid and required the City to follow the statute as written.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a cable company, on its own behalf and as a representative of a class, filed a petition to initiate proceedings pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 against defendants, the New York Commission on Cable Television and others, challenging the Commission's order, which implemented N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 817, and filed a declaratory judgment action seeking to declare that &sect; 817 was unconstitutional and a return of all moneys paid pursuant thereto.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 817, the Commission, which was authorized under N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 811 et seq., to regulate cable television companies, defrayed its expenses by allocating them among various cable television companies in proportion to their gross receipts. A cable company, individually and as representative of a class, initiated proceedings pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 against the Commission alleging that N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 817 imposed gross receipts tax upon proceeds from interstate commerce, violating the Commerce and the Supremacy Clause, and sought a declaration that &sect; 817 was unconstitutional. The court held that: (1) the action was not properly maintained as a class action because the cable company was not a proper representative, as some of the services it provided were not provided by a majority of cable operators; and (2) the Commission's general order implementing N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 817(2) was reasonable and lawful because there was no violation of the Commerce Clause, as gross annual receipts included only income derived from operations within the State, or violation of the Supremacy Clause, as the states had power to regulate cable television companies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the cable company's petition, which had challenged the Commission's order implementing the applicable statute, and the declaratory judgment action, which had sought to declare the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 817 of the Executive Law which assesses every cable television company a proportion of their annual gross receipts up to a maximum of 1%, in order to defray the costs and expenses of respondent Cable Television Commission, is constitutional.  Since gross annual receipts include only that income derived from operations within the State (Executive Law, &sect; 812, subd. 5), the commerce clause (U. S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3) is not violated.  In addition, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the statute does not violate either the Rules of the Federal Communications Commission (47 CFR Part 76) or the supremacy clause (U.

Ordinances art. 8 against plaintiff dance school, which was representing a class of similarly situated entities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under art. 8 the dance school was required to have a license to conduct its classes in the City. The school brought an action alleging that art. 8 was unconstitutional, and an injunction was granted prohibiting the City from enforcing it. The City sought here to have the injunction vacated, and the school sought summary judgment. The court granted the City's motion to vacate the injunction and denied the school's motion for summary judgment because art. 8 was a legitimate manifestation of the municipality's police power. The school had not sustained its burden of proving that the classifications were unreasonable, without any rational basis, or an improper exercise of the municipality's police power. Further, the limited discretion given to the City's police chief to refuse or waive the requirement of a license did not usurp the legislature's authority to legislate ordinances or statutes. Rather, the chief's discretion was merely the means of implementing the general intent of art. 8. Furthermore, the police chief's discretion was not unlimited or without any guidelines because it could only be exercised for cause.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance further empowers the Police Chief, &quot;for cause&quot;, to deny an application for a license or to waive the requirement for a license. These provisions are not arbitrary, unreasonable, unfair or unequal.  Action for a declaration of unconstitutionality is summarily dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, an auto dealer and a bank, brought a motion for summary judgment pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3212, asserting that plaintiff, the buyer of an automobile from the dealer, financed by the bank, did not create a triable issue of fact in her action for conversion following the repossession of the automobile. The dealer also sought summary judgment on a counterclaim for storage costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer had failed to make timely payments to the bank on her auto loan. After the buyer sought to pick up the vehicle from the dealer without paying for repairs, the bank paid the dealer the amount of its mechanic's lien and repossessed the car. The buyer sought damages for conversion of the car and personal property stored in the trunk, asserting that the repossession, while in accordance with N.Y. U.C.C. Law &sect; 9-503, violated her constitutional due process rights. The court granted the motion by the dealer and bank for summary judgment, with the exception of the buyer's personal property claim and the dealer's claim for storage. The court found no constitutional violation or unconscionability in the repossession, noting that the buyer expressly agreed to the self-help provisions in the contract with the bank, which were authorized under &sect; 9-503. The court found that both the buyer and the bank had an interest in the car, which was subject to due process protection. The court held that the dealer had a valid lien under N.Y. Lien Law &sect; 184, and on payment of that lien by the bank due to the buyer's default, the dealer had no choice but to transfer the car to the bank.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The plaintiff was not denied due process when the defendant bank repossessed her automobile under its security agreement contract and section 9-503 of the Uniform Commercial Code for default in payments while the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  automobile was in the possession of an automobile dealership under a lien for repairs. There is a distinction between &quot;self-help repossession&quot; under a private contract and replevin prior to a taking, even though both involve a taking prior to a judicial determination of the validity thereof, and the interests of both the buyer and the seller under the contract should be protected in a resolution of the due process question.  As the vendee-debtor, the plaintiff had title subject to her obligation to make timely payments.  The agreement expressly authorizing the &quot;self-help&quot; provisions in compliance with the statute cannot be held unconscionable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the indictment did not inform him of the exact place and time of the commission of the alleged criminal acts. The court held that the place of the offense was sufficiently stated if the indictment stated the county in which the offense was committed and that the exact time of the offense was inessential to the indictment's sufficiency unless time was a material ingredient of the crime. The court found that the indictment set forth the essential elements to secure a conviction for robbery in the first degree and further held that the indictment was sufficient even in the absence of a specification of details of the underlying evidentiary facts. The court also held that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 160.15 did not require proof that an implement brandished was capable of inflicting serious physical injury as defendant contended, although proof to the contrary adduced by defendant was an affirmative defense. The imposition upon defendant of the burden of establishing an affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence did not involve a violation of constitutional due process.</SPAN></P>

There is no requirement that separate counts be stated such that it can be determined if the offenses charged were committed at the same time or place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A statement in the indictment of the statutory elements of robbery in the first degree sets forth sufficient ultimate facts, as opposed to conclusions of law, even absent specification of underlying details, to state the specific criminal acts alleged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The imposition upon the defendant in a prosecution for robbery in the first degree of establishing the affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence that the weapon used was incapable of inflicting serious physical injury involves no constitutional violation.  The People are required to prove that the defendant displayed what appeared to be a firearm and allowance is made for rebuttal of the presumption that the weapon was loaded.  The burden of proof of the entire case and the duty of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt remain with the prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. No adequate showing has been made of defendant's need and intention&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to procure the testimony of his codefendants, that said testimony would be exculpatory or that defendant would be prejudiced by a joint trial, and defendant's application for a separate trial is accordingly denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The motion by defendant for disclosure of all exculpatory material is denied, since such disclosure is mandatory, acknowledged by the People and no order is required to force compliance upon request.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A planning director of respondent county denied petitioner city's application to construct a replacement swimming pool facility in a park. The Monroe County Planning Board (New York) affirmed the planning director's determination. The city sought review, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed facility was designed to replace to existing swimming pools; the new facility, which was to be operational year round, was located within one mile of a local airport and was within the approach path of incoming aircraft. On appeal from the Board's affirmance of the planning director's decision to deny the city's request to build the new pool, the city contended that the county was jurisdictionally divested of any power to deny the city's application and that Monroe County, N.Y., Charter &sect; 703a(a) (1965), which provided the planning director with the power of review over land use within one mile of a publicly owned airport, was invalid. On appeal, the court found that sufficient standards were set forth in N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 239-1 to delineate the discretionary power of the planning director even though such standards were not specifically found in the Monroe County Charter. The Charter referred to the criteria set forth in &sect; 239-1 as proper factors for consideration. The fact that the city's application was denied while other applications were approved did not, in and of itself, provide a basis for a claim of an arbitrary and capricious decision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- Monroe County Planning Board -- land use regulation within one mile of county airport -- Monroe County Planning Board, pursuant to Monroe County Charter, properly denied application by petitioner City of Rochester to construct swimming pool in park located within one mile of county airport; there are sufficient standards and guidelines delimiting discretionary power of planning board -- petitioner was not denied due process since it was afforded appeal to full planning board -- action taken by planning director and planning board was based upon analysis of all pertinent factors and is not arbitrary and capricious -- failure on part of planning director to comment on petitioner's 1972 application does not estop county from exercising its right of review -- planning director's power of review and approval of land use within one mile of airport is not invalid zoning action against municipality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Monroe County Planning Board properly denied the application of petitioner City of Rochester to construct a replacement swimming pool in a park located within&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  one mile of the Monroe County Airport. The Monroe County Charter gives the county planning board and the planning director the power of review over land use and land subdivision within one mile from the boundary line of any publicly owned airport within the county.  There are sufficient standards and guidelines delimiting the discretionary power of the planning board since the charter provides that the land use criteria set forth in section 239-l of the General Municipal Law shall be taken into account by the planning board in reviewing municipal planning actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner was not denied due process since it was afforded an appeal to the full planning board. Petitioner made its argument, presented its witnesses and submitted evidence in refuting the decision of the planning director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The action taken by the planning director and planning board is not arbitrary and capricious. Due deliberation, consideration and analysis was made of all pertinent factors relative to the land use proposed and the safety to airport operations and the safety to those on the ground affected by airport operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The county is not estopped from asserting its review powers under the county&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  charter. Notwithstanding the fact petitioner submitted its application for review in 1972 to the regional planning board, by submitting an application to the county planning board in 1974, petitioner has subjected itself to county review procedure.  Petitioner was aware of the county review powers and did not rely on the inaction of the county in 1972.  The failure on the part of the planning director to comment on petitioner's 1972 application cannot deprive the county of its vested right of review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The planning director's power of review and approval of land use and subdivisions within one mile of the airport is a valid police power and is not an invalid zoning action against a municipality. The sole consideration involved is safety.  </SPAN></P>

The decedent named her accountant, her attorney, and her husband as primary coexecutors, and most of her estate was located in New York when she died.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was a woman of mature years who had lived in New York for most of her life. Her will clearly reflected an intent to have her husband, her attorney, and her accountant all act as primary coexecutors of her estate to the maximum extent possible under the applicable laws of each state involved, and her relationships with the attorney and accountant were long standing. Florida law disqualified executors from service who were not residents of Florida or related to the decedent by blood. The court found that Florida's residency restriction was inequitable, and it held that the decedent had a fundamental property right to choose her own executors. The court noted that freedom to travel throughout the country was a basic constitutional right, and it stated its hope that legislative wisdom would correct the unfortunate restriction without the necessity for some estate to assume the burden of a search for judicial relief that might extend from the courts of Florida into the federal system.</SPAN></P>

Decedent's will reflects an intent to have her husband, her attorney, and her accountant act as primary coexecutors of her estate.  However, the fact that the attorney and the accountant are nonresidents of Florida, coupled with their lack of required blood relationship to decedent, disqualified them from serving as executors under the Florida statute.  The desire of decedent to circumvent the statutory restriction placed upon her in selecting her executors resulted in burdening her will with circuitous provisions otherwise unnecessary which rendered the administration of her estate unduly complex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Involved in contract disputes with local police and firefighting organizations, the city was compelled by the New York Public Employment Relations Board to submit to compulsory binding arbitration. The city petitioned for a stay of the arbitration and a declaration that N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 209, was an unconstitutional usurpation of the city's legislative authority. The court held that the statutory provisions providing for arbitration were constitutional and did not impair the &quot;home rule&quot; powers of the city. The court reasoned that the legislature has authority to mandate the terms and conditions of employment of municipal employees directly by general law without violating &quot;home rule.&quot; It followed, therefore, that the legislature could mandate the terms through the medium of compulsory and binding arbitration. The legislature could, in the interest of public health and welfare, require the settlement of disputes. Since, police and firefighting organizations were of great public interest, the legislature had authority to supersede &quot;home rule&quot; authority in such matters relating to the employment of those groups.</SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. &sect; 212(8) violated the requirements of equal protection under both federal and New York State Constitutions. The class affected by &sect; 212(8) was class A drug felons. The court noted that the right to have parole terminated in the discretion of the parole board was a fundamental right. Under &sect; 212(8), the State treated class A drug felons differently from other class A felons and applied a detrimental difference to only those convicted of class A drug felonies. The court stated that to continue the drug, nondrug distinction beyond the grant of parole was irrational. The court held that it made no sense to predicate different treatment on the assumption that a defendant's decision of whether or not to engage in illegal drug activities would be affected by the eligibility for discharge from parole, especially where the discharge was entirely discretionary. The court concluded that &sect; 212(8) was unconstitutional to the extent that it excluded class A drug felons from its operation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provision of subdivision 8 of section 212 of the Correction Law which excludes class A drug felons from parole discharge is unconstitutional, since there is no rational basis for a distinction between class A drug and nondrug felonies with respect to parole. The grant of parole is a determination that the parolee has been sufficiently rehabilitated to return to society on a permanent basis, and the standards relied upon for the determination in each case are the same.  In any event, discretionary discharge is so tentative that it can have no impact upon the statutory purpose of deterring the drug trade, and different treatment cannot be predicated upon the assumption of such effect.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff natural mother filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus seeking to obtain the return of four of her children living as foster children with respondent foster parents. The foster parents filed a motion to dismiss. Foster parents and respondent Department of Social Services of the County of Nassau, New York, filed a motion for alternative relief seeking an order to stay the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The natural mother voluntarily placed her children in foster care. The foster parents had two children for two years and two children for four years. The foster parents and the foster children joined in a federal class action that sought to redress the alleged denial of due process and equal protection of law under the United States Constitution to foster children and foster parents in New York State living together for more than one year. Upon review, the court determined that the provisions of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7003(a) did not require dismissal of the mother's writ of habeas corpus. The court decided that the stay issued in the federal class action restraining the social services department from removing the children from the foster parents' home did not affect returning a child from foster care to the care of a natural parent. The court found that the issue of the mother's writ was not before the federal court, the mother was not a party to the federal action, and federal courts generally leave custody decisions to state courts. The court concluded that it was not required by comity and justice to stay the custody proceeding brought by the mother.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner natural mother who voluntarily relinquished her four children in the custody of the Department of Social Services for placement in foster homes pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus, seeks&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to regain custody of her children who are currently living with respondent foster parents.  In a class action now pending before a three-Judge Federal panel involving the constitutionality of State laws and regulations governing removal of children from the care of foster parents in New York, a temporary restraining order was issued which restrained the Commissioner of the Department of Social Services from removing the four children from their foster parents' home.  However, such order does not mandate dismissal of petitioner's writ pursuant to CPLR 7003 (subd. [a]) since petitioner is not a party to the class action and the issue of custody which is the subject of the writ, is not the issue before the Federal court where the issue relates to the constitutionality of a statute.  Since there are two separate and distinct issues involved, petitioner is not precluded from litigating the issue of custody in State court which is the proper forum to determine custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

In addition, a stay would have the effect of unduly prejudicing the rights of the natural mother whose rights are paramount in such foster care cases and must be protected.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and six other stores were charged with violating the Blue Laws, but defendant was the only supermarket charged. It presented evidence that on the three Sundays it was alleged to have violated the Blue Law, a number of other stores in the area were also selling items in violation of the law. The district attorney testified that it was his office's policy to respond to complaints about stores violating the Blue Law, but not to initiate complaints itself. In this case, competing merchants sent employees to purchase items from defendant and other stores on Sundays and then filed complaints. In addition to expressing economic concerns, the complainants said that some of their employees were worried about possibly having to work on Sundays and that they felt that all stores should be obeying the law. Stating that the motivation of the complainants appeared to be a blend of altruism, practicality, and economics and that selective enforcement alone did not violate a defendant's right to equal protection, the court held that defendant had not met its heavy burden of establishing that the People consciously and intentionally discriminated against it in enforcing the law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selective enforcement of the Sabbath laws (General Business Law, art. 2) does not amount to an unconstitutional denial of a defendant's right to the equal protection of the laws, unless the defendant establishes intentional and invidious discrimination.  The defendant in this case is a large corporation which owns many retail supermarkets. It has not established such a defense.  Although the Sabbath laws are confusingly and illogically worded, it is for the Legislature to amend or repeal the laws.  Defendant's motion to dismiss these criminal prosecutions is denied.  </SPAN></P>

Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 720.10(2)(a), which under its explicit terms made defendant not eligible for youthful offender treatment upon conviction because one of the counts of the indictment charged a class A felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 18-year-old defendant had been indicted for a class A felony arising out of an alleged sale of cocaine, and other related offenses, occurring when he was age 17. Previously the court held that the &sect; 720.10(2)(a) restriction was unconstitutional and granted youthful offender treatment to an otherwise eligible youth who had pleaded guilty to an indictment charging a class A felony. Anticipating that the court would render the same ruling for defendant, the People claimed lack of standing on the argument that only a defendant convicted of less than a class A felony had cause to complain of the alleged unconstitutionality of the statute. It was asserted that defendant must go to trial and if convicted of a less than an A felony, he may then challenge the statute. The court found that the People's interpretation of &sect; 720.10(2)(a) was not what the Legislature intended and that in order for it to prove the lack of standing claim the statute would have to be rewritten to substitute the word &quot;convicted&quot; for &quot;indicted.&quot;</SPAN></P>

A defendant pleading guilty to class A felony charges has standing to challenge the constitutionality of the section under the due process clause, since the Legislature has not rewritten the statute to make conviction the basis for denial of youthful offender treatment.  </SPAN></P>

The employee brought this action seeking to secure his right to continued employment. The court ruled that the employee could not be removed without a hearing to determine whether there was cause to terminate his employment.

The state filed an application to reargue the case and the employee brought a cross motion that asserted that the court should have vacated the disciplinary notice. On reargument, the court adhered to its former determination. The court denied the cross motion of the employee, and refused to alter its decision to require a hearing on cause before the employee's firing could be upheld. The court noted that the Lloyd-Lafollette Act relied upon by the employee was constitutional and did not create an expectation of employment on the part of the employee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the statute violated an legislative policy of punishing inchoate crimes less severely than completed crimes and that it violated due process. He claimed that the penalty for an attempted murder of a police officer should be treated as a class B felony, as it would be if the intended victim were not a police officer. The court stated that while New York's legislature had generally preferred to provide lesser penalties for inchoate crimes, the legislature in some cases had specifically decreed that attempted crimes be punished to the same extent as completed ones. Moreover, the court stated, the legislature's enactment of a provision raising the classification of attempted murder of a policeman from a class B to a class A felony should be viewed for what it was: a clear expression of intent on the part of the legislature to increase the penalty for this inchoate crime, not to reduce it. To hold the statute invalid, the court stated, would interfere with this legislative intent. The court then held that the statute did not violate due process. It found that the statute had a rational basis in fact and was by no means arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant stands convicted of having attempted, in May, 1973, to murder a peace officer who was performing his official duties. At that time, such an attempt was a class A felony (Penal Law, &sect; 110.05, as amd. by L. 1972, ch. 292).  A class A felony is punishable by an indeterminate sentence with a maximum of life imprisonment (Penal Law, &sect; 70.00, subd. 2, par. [a]).  Even if, in this instance, the attempt is punishable as severely as the completed crime, the statute is valid and constitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court was called upon to decide whether the mother, as custodial parent, had the prerogative of making the determination as to when and under what circumstances, if at all, the child could see her father, or whether the court should exercise its authority as parens patriae to temper the &quot;best interests of the child&quot; maxim with a recognition that the father of a child, even though illegitimate, had a right to association with his child. The court granted visitation rights to the father. The court recognized that the interest of the father of an illegitimate child in retaining custody of his child was cognizable and substantial. The court found that to deprive him of the child's custody without a hearing as to his fitness as a parent was a denial of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that (1) it was not in the child's best interest to be shielded by the mother from all future contact with her father, and (2) the child's best interests required that she should have some continuing association with a father who had amply demonstrated his love and concern for his daughter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For about 3 1/2 years, a couple lived together in Florida without marriage, and had a daughter who was about 2 3/4 years old when the woman moved out and took their daughter with her.  Thereafter, the man, who dearly loves his daughter, offered to marry the woman, but she refused.  From time to time the woman did permit him to visit the daughter; but recently the woman married a man in New York State and has had a child by him; and now the woman lives in New York State and she refuses to permit the father of her daughter to visit the girl, who is now 6 years old.  This devoted father of this out-of-wedlock child has set up an irrevocable trust fund for his child's benefit, and he has devised his residuary estate for her benefit.  Psychiatric testimony and other testimony has been presented by both sides.  All the parties are emotionally normal and intelligent but the mother persists in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  influencing the child against its natural, loving father.

The court passed upon the challenge as to the constitutionality of &sect; 165.30, finding that the court took cognizance of the well established principle that the statute, like all other legislative enactments, was supported by a strong presumption of validity. Further, to establish the contrary, the unconstitutionality of the statute had to be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt, which defendant had not done.

The essence of the offense is the intent to swindle and defraud the victim after gaining his confidence. The statute is broad and comprehensive in its terms and is designed to cover any swindling operation.  Rules of conduct must necessarily be expressed in general terms and depend for their application upon circumstances, which by the very nature of the crime, vary from case to case.  </SPAN></P>

As such, the political decision, namely what type and the terms of a collective bargaining agreement contract the city would make an bind itself to, was removed from the jurisdiction of elected public officials and placed within the jurisdiction of the appointive public arbitration panel. The court found that the chapters were unconstitutional because they created invidious discrimination based on wealth without reasonable classification. The principle of one-person, one-vote was applicable to local governmental units. Because the elected local legislature of the government involved and the appointed public arbitration panel were both official bodies, and because the power of the former had to terminate before the latter could exist, the court made the determination that the one-person, one-vote rule applied to the public arbitration panel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A habeas corpus proceeding was brought on behalf of petitioner relator, who was being detained pursuant to an order of the family court pending trial. A probable cause hearing was held at which a determination was made that there was probably cause to believe that the charged acts were committed and that the relator committed them. After the hearing the relator was ordered remanded to a juvenile center, without bail, pending his trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The relator challenged the validity of the remand order. A petition based upon information and belief was filed in the family court accusing the relator of acts, which if committed by an adult, would constitute murder in the second degree, manslaughter in the first degree, assault in the first degree, reckless endangerment in the first degree, criminal possession of stolen property in the third degree, and menacing in the first degree. The issue was whether preventive detention could validly be imposed in the family court for juveniles who were accused of being juvenile delinquents. On appeal, the court held that there could be no compelling state interest in prohibiting preventive detention for adults while allowing it for juveniles, and thus N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 739(b) had to be declared unconstitutional. The court held that it was irrational to conclude that persons under the age of 16, who were found to have a propensity to commit crime, needed to be kept from society while persons over 16 who were found to have an equal, or greater, propensity to commit crime could not, by virtue of that fact alone, be confined.</SPAN></P>

This provision amounts to an unconstitutional denial of the equal protection of the laws.  Accordingly, despite a finding made by the Family Court after a hearing that there was probable cause to believe that a 15-year-old boy had committed acts which, if committed by a person aged 16 or more, would constitute murder, manslaughter, assault, reckless endangerment, menacing, and criminal possession of stolen property, and despite a finding by the Family Court under said&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  subdivision (b) of section 739, the Supreme Court in Kings County released the boy on his own recognizance. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state initiated an action against the dog owners after they refused when tendering their dog license fee to pay an additional 10 cents as provided for in N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. &sect; 109-b, subd 2. On appeal, the court reversed the lower court's judgment upon finding that the burden for the 10 cent tax being placed on dog owners as a class had a fair and substantial relationship to legislation relating to the study of dog diseases, that the classification of dog owners as the taxpayers therein was reasonable and that all dog owners were being treated alike, and that those who own dogs should rightfully help bear the financial burden of the study of dog diseases as they affect not only dogs but man and other animals as well. The court determined that the 10 cents provided for in &sect; 109-b was a tax and not a fee and that the legislative intent was that the 10 cent tax imposed was not to be used exclusively for the study of diseases of dogs but as such diseases affect man and other animals as well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's affirmance of the city court's decision dismissing action of the state and declaring unconstitutional a statutory dog-licensing tax.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff mortgagee's action to foreclose a consolidated building loan, defendant mortgagor challenged both the ex parte appointment of a receiver and the right of the mortgagee to have a receiver appointed on notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action to foreclose the mortgage that secured a construction loan for buildings containing hundreds of condominiums, the mortgagee had a receiver appointed in an ex parte proceeding pursuant to the terms of the mortgage and N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 254, which was also referred to in the mortgage. The court denied the mortgagor's motion to vacate the appointment of the receiver, because the issuance of the ex parte order was not constitutionally defective under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the mortgagor had agreed to the ex parte process in arm's length negotiations at which he was represented by counsel, and because N.Y. C.P.L.R. 6405 entitled him to move immediately to vacate the receivership. The court held that even if the appointment of a receiver ex parte was constitutionally defective, that defect was cured by the subsequent motion and the opportunity to be heard fully on the issues. The court limited the powers of the receiver, however, because the mortgage lien only applied to, and did not give the receiver title to, the unsold units and the interest of those units in the common areas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied mortgagor's motion to vacate the appointment of the receiver because the ex parte procedure, to which mortgagor had agreed at arm's length, did not violate his due process rights.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant corporation is the owner of a large parcel of real property which includes 458 condominium units.  Of the 458 units constructed, 284 have been sold.  Plaintiff is the lead-lender on a construction loan in the amount of $ 16,000,000 which is secured by a consolidated building loan mortgage. Defendant defaulted in repaying the $ 4,814,521 balance due under the mortgage&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  whereupon plaintiff commenced an action to foreclose the mortgage. Pursuant to a covenant in the mortgage, plaintiff, by an ex parte order had a receiver appointed for the collection of rents and profits issuing from the mortgaged premises.  The receiver was given the additional authority to sell the remaining condominium units and to generally manage the premises.  The issuance of the ex parte order was not constitutionally defective since the covenant in the mortgage which provided for the appointment of a receiver entitled plaintiff, pursuant to section 254 of the Real Property Law, to such an ex parte appointment. Moreover, even if the appointment of a receiver ex parte was constitutionally defective that defect was cured by the opportunity afforded the parties to be heard on the issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since the Condominium Act (Real Property Law, art. 9-B) places the authority and responsibility for the management of the condominium in the board of managers, defendant, as the sponsor of the project has no right to operate and manage the project, therefore, any court-appointed receiver has no right to collect rents from the professional or commercial space in the condominium buildings, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to undertake repairs to the common areas, pay taxes thereon or perform any of the functions a receiver normally performs, since the powers of the receiver cannot exceed those of defendant.  In addition, since the board of managers has responsibility for the management of the condominium, it is doubtful that the unit owners as individuals could legally consent to giving the receiver the broad powers requested by plaintiff.  There is no legal authority to grant the receiver the power to take over the management of the condominium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The receiver has no authority to sell any of the unsold condominum units.  However, he may apply to the court to lease such units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Among the actual powers given to the receiver is the power to lease and manage those portions of the real property which are encumbered by plaintiff's mortgage but which are not part of the condominium offering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. It is suggested that all the parties concerned and the receiver attempt to reach some agreement as to a plan for the management of the property pending the determination of the action.  </SPAN></P>
