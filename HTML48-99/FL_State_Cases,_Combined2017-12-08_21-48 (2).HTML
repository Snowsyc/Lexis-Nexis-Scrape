<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county property appraiser sought reversal of the order of the Circuit Court for Pasco County (Florida), dismissing on untimeliness grounds an action challenging the decision to grant an agricultural classification to appellee property owners' property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county property appraiser denied appellee property owners an agricultural classification for their property. Appellees turned to the county board of tax adjustment, which granted them the agricultural classification they sought. Appellant then filed suit against appellees in circuit court seeking to enjoin the board from enforcing its decision. Appellees moved to dismiss, arguing that pursuant to Fla. R. App. P. 3.2, appellant's action was untimely. The circuit court granted the motion, noting the untimeliness under Rule 3.2 and further declaring Fla. Stat. ch. 194.171(2), which granted additional time to file the action appellant pursued, to be unconstitutional. On further appeal, the state supreme court reversed the order. The court noted that the appellate rules did not apply because appellant's action was really an original lawsuit rather than an appeal of an administrative action. Because the legislature could set statutes of limitations, Fla. Stat. ch. 194.171(2) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court declared that the statute setting the time period for filing appellant's action was a constitutional statute of limitations.

Stat. ch. 95.11(3)(c) (1975) violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner completed construction of a building. More than 12 years after petitioner's completion of construction, respondent was injured in the building in the course of his employment. Respondent sued both the owner of the building and its builders. When petitioner moved for summary judgment based on the statutory 12 year ban on lawsuits proscribed in Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(3)(c) (1975), the trial court declared the statute unconstitutional. This allowed respondent to proceed with the lawsuit notwithstanding the seeming bar of the statute. The supreme court affirmed the trial court's decision. The supreme court found that Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(3)(c) (1975) created absolute immunity from suit for certain professionals and contractors connected with the construction of improvements to real property after the expiration of 12 years from the completion of the building. The supreme court determined that the statute abolished respondent's right to sue petitioner for his injuries and provided no alternative form of redress. The supreme court concluded that Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(3)(c) (1975) violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order dismissing the information against appellee. Appellee was charged with dealing in stolen property, which was dismissed by the trial court on the grounds that Fla. Stat. ch. 812.012 to 812.028 (1977) were facially invalid under the federal and state constitutions because they failed to provide adequate notice of the prohibited conduct. On review, the court held that the statutes were constitutionally sound because reasonable persons had adequate notice of the types of conduct proscribed, finding there was clearly no constitutional prohibition against a law enforcement officer providing the opportunity for a person who had the willingness and readiness to break the law. The court held that it was only when the government's deception actually implanted the criminal design in the mind of the defendant that the defense of entrapment came into play. The thrust of the entrapment defense was to focus on the intent or predisposition of the defendant to commit the crime, and where a defendant sought acquittal by reason of entrapment he could not complain of an appropriate and searching inquiry into his own conduct and predisposition as bearing upon that issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order dismissing the information against appellee was reversed and remanded because the statutes were constitutionally sound in that reasonable persons had adequate notice of the types of conduct proscribed. The court held that the focus was on the predisposition to commit to commit the crime, and entrapment was only available where the government's deception actually implanted the criminal design in the mind of the appellee.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also challenged a circuit court's denial of defendant's requested jury instruction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was charged by indictment with the offenses of first-degree murder and robbery. The trial court convicted appellant of crimes charged and sentenced appellant to death. Appellant contended that error was committed when the trial court excused certain prospective jurors because of their conscientious objection to the death penalty. The supreme court held that a death sentence could not be carried out if the jury that imposed or recommended it was chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty. The supreme court held that the trial court did not commit reversible error when it allowed the removal for cause prospective jurors. Appellant also complained that gruesome and inflammatory photographs were admitted into evidence, saying that they were unduly prejudicial. The supreme court held that that the photographs were admissible into evidence because they were relevant to the issue presented. The supreme court concluded that the death penalty statute was constitutional. Accordingly, the supreme court affirmed the convictions and sentences imposed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion. Defendant executed a promissory note under seal and eventually defaulted on the repayment schedule. Plaintiff eventually filed suit on the promissory note, and defendant filed a motion to dismiss because Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(1) (1975) amended the statute of limitations from 20 years to only five years. The trial court denied plaintiff's motion. On review, defendant argued that the statute was retroactive; plaintiff claimed that it was not and that the statute of limitations in effect at the time of execution and default was controlling. The court found that the legislature had the power to shorten statutes of limitation retroactively as long as a reasonable time to file suit was provided those with existing causes of action. The court held that the statute contained a savings clause of one year, which was a reasonable time to allow retroactive application within constitutional parameters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged his conviction in a second trial for first-degree murder and his sentence to death following a jury recommendation of life imprisonment from the trial court (Florida).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted appellant of first-degree murder and the trial court sentenced him to death following a jury recommendation of life imprisonment. Appellant had previously been brought to trial on a charge of first-degree murder, but a hung jury necessitated a second trial. Appellant argued that he was unconstitutionally twice placed in jeopardy when the state sought to prosecute him for first-degree murder, since an earlier negotiated plea of guilty to second-degree murder had been accepted by the trial judge. The court held that the double jeopardy clause did not bar the reprosecution of an accused who willfully refused to perform a condition of a guilty plea accepted by the trial court on that basis. Further, the state was not barred from bringing the second prosecution on the original charge despite the fact that the vacated plea had been for a lesser degree of criminality. With respect to the trial court's imposition of the death sentence, the court found that the more severe penalty was not so clearly directed by the sentencing evidence that it should override the considered judgment of the jury. The court affirmed the conviction, but vacated the death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed appellant's conviction of first-degree murder and remanded the case with directions to enter a sentence of life imprisonment. The double jeopardy clause of the Florida and federal constitutions did not bar his being tried for first-degree murder. The death sentence was vacated because the jurors had information appropriate to their weighing responsibility under the statute and they found that it favored life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Before the court for consideration were the following certified questions: 1.Did Fla.

Did the special provisions of existing statutory law referred to in Fla. Stat. ch. 687.031, which created statutory exceptions to the general law of Florida governing interest and usury, violate Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 11(a)(9), as being special laws fixing interest rates on private contracts? Appellant borrowed money evidenced by a note from appellee who was entitled to receive interest at the maximum rate allowed by Florida law. Appellant contended that under the usury statute, the note was usurious on its face. The court concurred with the rationale of the trial court and agreed with appellee that the classifications created by the legislature through enactment of ch. 687.031 and 656.17(1) were reasonable and that these laws were general laws, which operated uniformly throughout the state upon these classifications.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants alleged that appellee charged them interest which exceeded the 10 percent per annum lawful interest rate, which amounted to usury in violation of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants challenged the validity of Fla. Stat. ch. 77-183 (1977), under which employers could secure state registration of their apprenticeship programs only upon a determination of need by the Bureau of Apprenticeship, asserting that the statute was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to an administrative agency because it failed to delineate any factors or considerations impacting whether need was shown. The statute's predecessor permitted registration whenever a demand was made. The reviewing court agreed with appellants, finding that the term &quot;need&quot; was susceptible of so many conflicting applications that the agency and the courts could not ascertain the legislative intent in the absence of any statutory factors or considerations. Thus, the court held the statute to be unconstitutional, reinstating the previous statutory language, reversing the judgment, and remanding the case with instructions to enter judgment for appellants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, city utilities commission, sought review of a decision in favor of respondent power company by the First District Court of Appeal (Florida), which held that Fla. Stat. ch. &sect; 119.11(2) (1975) controlled over Fla. R. App. P. 5.12(1) regarding the stay of orders on appeal. That court also held that the attorney-client and work product privileges did not extend to discovery under Fla. Stat. ch. &sect; 119.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The power company sought inspection of the commission's planning, operation, and maintenance records under Florida's public records laws during litigation, but the commission denied access to those records prior to the removal by its attorney of privileged or confidential documents. The power company obtained a writ of mandamus, and the order was affirmed on appeal. On further appeal, the court reversed that part the decision which gave precedence to the statutory rule and affirmed the ruling that the protections of judicially created privileges of confidentiality did not extend to public records. The court held that when the commission filed its notice of appeal from the order requiring it to open records for inspection, the filing of that notice acted as an automatic stay of the lower court's order. The court also held that public records had confidentiality by statutory exemption or by express exemptions under general or special law.

The court ruled that the policy of &sect; 193.461 (4)(a)3. was to promote agricultural use of land. Further, the court held that the legislature intended to limit application of the statute to those cases where land was rezoned from an agricultural use to a non-agricultural use at the owner's request.

Petitioners sought recovery from respondents. Respondents alleged that petitioners failed to meet the threshold requirements for the Florida Automobile Reparations Reform Act, Fla.

Respondents also alleged that no property damages were to be awarded. The court held that property damages were always recoverable. Thus, it reversed the judgment that petitioners were not entitled to property damages when the requirements for the no-fault insurance act were not met. However, it affirmed in favor of respondents that petitioners were not entitled to damages for the loss of consortium. The court held that the threshold requirements under ch. 627.737 had to be met before petitioners could collect for a loss of consortium.

The statute prohibited the joinder of a motor vehicle liability insurer as a defendant in a lawsuit brought against its insured. The court determined that the joinder of a motor vehicle liability insurer was a procedural aspect of trial reserved to the rulemaking authority of the Supreme Court by Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(a) of the Florida Constitution, and the statute has impermissibly encroached on a prerogative of the judiciary. The statute was not a substantive right which the legislature could freely grant to or withhold. The plain language of Fla. Stat. ch. 627.7262(1977) provided that the joinder of insurers was merely a procedural step in the conduct of a motor vehicle tort lawsuit. Further, the court held that the timing of joinder during the course of a trial was a matter of practice or procedure assigned by the Constitution exclusively to the Supreme Court of Florida.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the trial court failed to set forth its reasons that the statute was unconstitutional, but the court concluded that it was because of the trial court's uncertainty as to the meaning of common bookmaking scheme. The court held that the term was sufficiently clear and required proof that appellees engaged in a joint plan with three or more persons to take or receive wagers upon the specified contests. Appellant also argued that the trial court erred when it determined that the information was insufficient. The court held that pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 849.25(3) (1975), appellant had to have proven that appellees were engaged in a bookmaking scheme with three or more persons, but it was not essential to prove the identity of these persons, and as such the information did not require the naming of these individuals.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two defendants entered nolo contendere pleas for criminal offenses. They were sentenced. The state filed a motion to impose additional court costs, as authorized by the Florida Crimes Compensation Act (Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 960 (1977), which was enacted to fund and dispense money to needy victims of certain crimes. The trial court denied the state's motion and found that the Act was unconstitutional because it denied equal protection and due process. The court reversed because the legislature could levy fines for various offenses and use that revenue in a manner designed to further a legitimate public purpose. Because the Act had the potential to benefit any citizen, even those that may have previously committed an offense, it was created for a legitimate public purpose and Fla. Stat. ch. 960.20 (1977) and Fla. Stat. ch. 960.25 (1977) were constitutional, as they related to a surcharge to criminal offenders. Insofar as Fla. Stat. ch. 960.25 (1977) imposed a direct charge on civil fines, it was unconstitutional because such a fee was required to have a reasonable relation to the statute, and those fees could not be so excessive such that they constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of two counts of sexual battery in violation of Fla.

On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's conviction but remanded to the trial court with instructions to vacate appellant's death sentence and to impose upon him instead two sentences of life imprisonment. The trial court should have sustained the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment unless the facts suggesting a death sentence had been so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ. Although appellant's crime was loathsome and revolting, there was no showing of extraordinary cruelty or of violence or injury beyond that which was necessarily attendant upon a child's rape.

Stat. ch. 372.922. The trial court dismissed the information and declared the statute and its implementing regulations unconstitutional. Appellant challenged this decision. Appellee argued to the court that the statute and its regulations lacked clear criteria for making permit decisions, and appellee lacked proper notice of the conduct prohibited. Appellant argued that the statute's language was sufficiently definite to comprehend that a permit was required to possess certain wildlife and that the regulations elaborated the specific details. The court ruled that the statute itself was constitutional because it was not vague, and it informed an average person of what conduct was prohibited. The court, however, ruled that the implementing regulations were unconstitutionally vague because they provided inadequate standards for issuance of a wildlife permit. The court held that the valid statute could not be constitutionally applied using invalid implementing regulations.

Plaintiff State of Florida filed criminal complaints against several defendants for violations of Fla. Stat. ch. 409.325(2)(a). Two separate trial courts dismissed the charges on the ground that the language &quot;in any manner not authorized by law&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. Plaintiff appealed. The supreme court found that the Florida legislature intended to incorporate the federal law and regulations that were in effect when ch. 409.325(2)(a) was enacted. Then, the court reversed the trial courts' decisions dismissing the criminal charges against defendants because, when an individual participated in a welfare program, he incurred a duty to ascertain what conduct was required of him; thus, the statute was not vague if its language allowed a person of ordinary intelligence to know what conduct was prohibited. The statute was sufficiently definite to inform defendants that their conduct in selling non-food items for food stamps was proscribed.</SPAN></P>

The standard by which land development regulations were to be measured was not articulated by the legislature but was to be determined as the sole province of the administrative agency through formulation of principles. This violated the doctrine of nondelegation of legislative power. Under this doctrine, fundamental, primary policy decisions should have been made by members of the legislature who were elected to perform those tasks and administration of legislative programs should have been pursuant to some minimal standards and guidelines ascertainable by reference to the establishing enactment. The court held that the statutory standards for exercise of the power to designate areas of critical state concern were inadequate and that the delegation consequently violated Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decisions of the lower court upholding the challenges of appellee land developers against appellant governor, finding that the statute was an unconstitutional delegation to an administrative body of legislative power to make fundamental policy decisions without adequate standards for doing so.</SPAN></P>

The lower court denied appellant's motions, and appellant pleaded nolo contendere to all charges, specifically reserving her right to appeal. On appeal, the decision of the lower court was affirmed. The state supreme court held that the informations were sufficient to inform appellant of the nature of the offenses charged and did not mislead or embarrass her in the preparation of her defense or subject her to double jeopardy. The court also determined that precedent had resolved the issue of the constitutionality of the statutes in favor of their validity. The court further held that because the giving of a jury instruction involved issues of law and fact, depending in part upon the evidence presented, the lower court's ruling on a pre-trial request for instructions was not appealable on a plea of nolo contendere.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant county commissioner was charged with using his official position to secure a special privilege in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 112.313. It was alleged defendant secured a special privilege for a person by locating a public road adjacent to the person's property, thereby enhancing the value of the person's property. The trial judge dismissed the information and ruled that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The state appealed the decision. On appeal, the reviewing court stated the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it did not convey a sufficiently definite warning regarding the proscribed conduct. The court stated it was a customary duty of county commissioners to make determinations relating to construction of new roads and improvement of old ones. In making such determinations, certain private owners were benefited instead of others. To say that such decisions were criminal in nature was incredible and justified the conclusion of many highly qualified citizens to refuse to serve in public office. To impose punishment under the statute violated the fundamental precepts of due process. The order of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued that the statute failed to give fair notice that criminal penalties could be imposed for &quot;oral,&quot; as well as recorded, bet taking. The court held that the statute met the controlling standards for overcoming vagueness because persons of ordinary intelligence could not reasonably conclude that unwritten bet-taking did not violate a law prohibiting &quot;book&quot;-making. Defendants' overbreadth challenge, which rested on the premise that a writing was an indispensable element of the offense of book making, failed as well. The court also upheld the affidavit upon which undercover officials obtained a wiretap on defendants' phone. The court held that the affidavit included a full and complete statement that other investigative procedures had been tried or appeared unlikely to succeed, as required by ch. 934.09(1)(c) (1975).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was charged with theft in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 812.012, 812.014. He contended that the statutes under which he was convicted were unconstitutional. The court found that the statutes had a plain legal meaning that was readily ascertainable from the common law and decisional law of the state. The fact that some words had two or more meanings did not necessarily render them unconstitutionally vague because it was manifestly clear to a person of ordinary intelligence what was intended by the legislature's use of each term in the context of the theft statutes. As for the prohibition against &quot;other conduct similar in nature,&quot; the court opined that the principle of ejusdem generis was properly employed to sustain its use in the statute's provision. Moreover, because the terms were sufficiently definite and similar, it cannot be said that the legislature had failed to provide adequate standards to guide prosecutorial or judicial discretion in the enforcement of the law. Accordingly, the trial judge ruled correctly in upholding the constitutionality of the statutes, and the order denying the motion to dismiss was affirmed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's order, which denied appellant's motion to dismiss theft charges was affirmed because the statutes under which appellant was charged were not unconstitutionally vague and uncertain, nor did they improperly delegate legislative power.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant failed to prove there was no rational basis for the statute. There was authority supporting the position that the health hazards of cannabis justified its proscription and classification. Although there was substantial expert opinion to the contrary, the opinions supporting the statute were sufficient to constitute a continuing rational basis for the act. The court also held that the punishment provided for the sale and possession of cannabis, by Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After entering nolo contendere pleas, defendant was convicted of distributing obscene material in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 847.07 (1975). Defendant appealed the convictions, claiming that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 847.07 (1975) was impermissibly vague. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that in determining whether an obscenity statute was vague the court could consider not only the statutory language, but also any prior constructions given to the statute by case law. Applying this standard, the court found that defendant was put on notice that the content of its films would be considered obscene. The court also upheld the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 847.08 (1975), which provided for production of allegedly obscene materials for the purpose of determining whether there was probable cause to believe that said material was obscene. Although the production was initially made to the police, the process that followed involved the presentation of an affidavit to a magistrate who then determined whether probable cause existed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner city brought a complaint to quiet title to a tract of land. Respondent corporation moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that petitioner's claim was barred by the Marketable Record Title Act (act). The district court granted the motion. Petitioner contended that its claim was not barred by the act because the root of title relied upon by respondent was a wild deed. Respondent countered that the root of title was not a wild deed. On appeal, the court initially held that the act was constitutional because it was designed to simplify conveyances of real property, which concerned the public welfare. Moreover, because the act provided a reasonable time to protect property interests, it was not unconstitutional as a retroactive statute. As to the deed, the court held that the wild deed was merely a link in a chain commencing before the effective root of title. Also, the deed properly constituted a root of title because it did not reflect that it was a wild deed nor did it appear that there was any defect in the makeup of the deed. On this basis, the court approved the judgment of the district court in dismissing petitioner's complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 3(b)(1), appellant handicapped students sought direct review of two trial court orders, consolidated on appeal, that upheld the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 230.23(4)(m)7 (1977). Both cases involved insufficient funding of appellants' private education by appellees, public school board and state education agency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant handicapped students attended private schools because the public schools lacked services to meet their physical needs. Due to a change in school funding policy pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 230.23(4)(m)7 (1977), appellee school board paid only part of their tuition. Appellants' parents sought reimbursement of the balance in court. Both cases were preliminarily dismissed. On review, the court upheld the statute as constitutional under the more stringent state provision, Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The court held that the statute allowed schools to scale tuition payments to the severity of the child's handicap and thus was reasonably based on a student's particular needs. The statute denied appellants a state mandated free education only where private programs were not available within the tuition cap. Appellants had not provided sufficient facts upon which the court could make that determination. In one case, the court accepted as true all well-pled facts and found that appellant had stated a cause of action requiring remand. In the other case, however, which was dismissed on summary judgment, the court was procedurally compelled to affirm the final order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court upheld as constitutional the school funding statute that limited appellee school board's tuition reimbursement of appellant handicapped students' private education. The court reversed and remanded one case, finding that appellant had sufficiently pled a cause of action; in the other case, however, the trial court order of dismissal was affirmed based upon the procedural posture of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with four counts of battery on a law enforcement officer and a fire fighter, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 784.07 (1977). Defendant moved to dismiss, but the trial court denied his motion. He pled nolo contendere to one of the counts and appealed the denial of his motion to dismiss. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling. The court rejected defendant's argument that the definition of &quot;fire fighter&quot; was vague and overbroad and could not convey a sufficiently definite warning of the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practice. The court found it clear that the legislature intended to give special protection to those who protected the public's life and property by risking his life in fighting fires. Thus, the statute provided an individual of common intelligence with sufficient warning of the proscribed conduct. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the statute violated equal protection without comment. Finally, the court rejected defendant's argument that the statute was unconstitutional because its title failed to express the subject of the enactment, finding that it sufficiently gave fair notice of its contents.</SPAN></P>

The district court held that Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 7E-1.06(15), (16), which imposed strict liability on horse trainers under certain circumstances, was invalid under existing principles of law.

Code Ann. r. 7E-1.06(15), (16), which prohibited the possession of unauthorized drugs or any device by which such drugs could be administered in an area where horses are kept, and which required that all medications, whether authorized or not, be kept in locked storage. After holding that the rules were invalid because they imposed strict liability, the district court certified the issue of whether a thoroughbred horse trainer was an absolute insurer under the rules. The court answered the question in the affirmative, held that the absolute insurer rules for thoroughbred horse trainers were valid, and quashed the opinion below. The court determined that the rules constituted a reasonable means of eliminating or minimizing the possibility of illegal drugging by placing total responsibility on the person most capable of controlling the problem. The court concluded that the rules were a valid exercise of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lower court vacated the final judgment and remanded the case for a new trial holding that severances and prohibitions of mentioning insurance coverage to juries were harmful, and declaring that Fla.

On appeal, the court held that the issue was whether the prohibition against the mention of insurance coverage was procedural and therefore, within this court's domain, or a part of a substantive right, properly within a legislative waiver of sovereign immunity. The trial in this case proceeded without constitutional error. And, although the severance was an error, no one was hurt by it in light of the verdict for the school board. The jury was not unaware of anything the plaintiff was entitled to reveal to it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision of the lower court and remanded the cause with instructions to reinstate the final judgment on the grounds that the severance was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowners sought review of a judgment from the Leon County Circuit Court (Florida), which found for appellee state and held that The Big Cypress Conservation Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 380.055, was constitutional. Appellants alleged that the statute violated Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 11(a), which banned the issuance of state bonds pledging the state's full faith and credit except to finance or refinance the cost of state capital projects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Holding that the acquisition of land under Fla. Stat. ch. 380.055 for donation to the federal government was a proper state project under Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 11(a), the court affirmed the judgment for appellee state. The court held that the eventual control of the land by the federal government did not detract from the state status of the project, noting the state's interest under Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 7, in conservation and the protection of natural resources, which interest was enforceable through ch. 380.055 and appellee's agreement with the federal government. Furthermore, the court held that the donation of land under a navigable state waterway did not violate the constitutional trust imposed on that land for the people of the state. Even if the donation were characterized as a sale, the court still held that the trust was not violated, because the sale had been authorized by law, and the law's goal of environmental protection was unquestionably in the public interest. The court also held that appellants had no remedy for appellee's alleged breach of a promise regarding the order of acquisition of the land, finding no proof of such a contract in the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment for appellee state. The court held that a law that authorized the use of state full faith and credit bonds to finance the purchase of environmental sensitive lands was a constitutionally valid state project, in light of the proposed donation of the lands to the federal government. The court also held that the donation or even sale of land under navigable waters to the federal government was not a breach of trust.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the captain of a shrimp boat, was charged with two violations of Fla. Stat. ch. 370.13(2)(f) (1974). Appellant and several other shrimpers were trawling in an area which was also being fished by crabbers who, in preceding days, noticed the loss of several traps. Upon investigation, appellant was found to have some of the traps in his boat's nets. Appellant argued the statute under which he was charged was unconstitutionally vague and broad. The trial court found the statute constitutional and convicted appellant of violating it by molesting traps belonging to another without the owner's permission. Appellant was placed on two years probation and fined $ 500. The Florida Supreme Court found the statute was not vague in that its wording was sufficient to put an average man on notice of the prohibited conduct, but it was unable to determine whether the trial court's judgment was based on a finding of willfulness or negligence. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court was reversed, and the matter was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court held that the constitutional issues raised were frivolous and that the other issues raised by appellant were meritless because the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the conviction and the allegation of vagueness of the statutory provisions was unfounded. Rejecting appellant's contention that the statute constituted a use of criminal penalties to enforce contractual rights in violation of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 (1968), the court noted that Fla. Stat. chs. 559.41, 559.43 (1975) embodied the public purpose of protecting the public from unsightly and ill-kept cemeteries. Finally, the court determined that the information was sufficient to charge appellant with the crime for which he was convicted and that there was no fatal variance between the charges in the information and the proof offered at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a felony conviction, filed a motion with the trial court for setting bail pending appeal, and alleged, among other things, that the provisions of Fla.

Finding that probable cause had been found on other felony charges pending against defendant and holding that ch. 903.132 and Fla. R. Crim.

On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court found that defendant had been charged with, and probable cause had been found for, seven separate crimes; that release on bail pending appeal was not guaranteed by the U.S. Const. amend. VIII or the Florida constitution; that the court acted within the guidelines of the statute and criminal procedural rule; and that the court's action was reasonable and not arbitrary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was convicted of cocaine possession and was sentenced to imprisonment. To avoid immediate incarceration, petitioner requested bond. The prosecution contended petitioner was not entitled to bond because both Fla. Stat. ch. 903.132(1) and Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.691(a) provided bond pending appeal was not available to a person convicted of a felony who had been previously convicted of another felony and whose civil rights had not been restored. Petitioner challenged the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 903.132(1) and Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.691(a) on the grounds that they denied him equal protection by creating a classification that affected his fundamental rights in a way which was not the least restrictive means of effectuating the state's objective. The court noted it was well established that there was no absolute constitutional right to bond pending appeal of any state criminal conviction, whether misdemeanor or felony, first or subsequent. The court continued that because there was no fundamental right affected, and petitioner conceded the state's compelling interest, it was clear that these provisions did not contravene any constitutional notions of equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner's request for a writ of habeas corpus was denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner Florida Real Estate Commission sought to enjoin respondent corporation from selling its real property through three salaried, non-licensed employees pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 475.01(2). The statute provided that those who sell real property have to be licensed, except for individuals who are dealing with their own property. Under the exception, one officer could sell property belonging to a corporation. The injunction was not issued, and the court held that ch. 475.01(2) violated respondent's right to equal protection. Petitioner appealed. The supreme court affirmed the ruling of the trial court. It found the law was unconstitutionally restrictive because respondent's ability to sell corporate real property was unduly limited in that only one unlicensed corporate employee could sell its property. The court found the &quot;one officer&quot; limitation bore no reasonable relationship to the protection of the public, in part, because an injured party had direct recourse against a corporation whose employee sold the real property under the doctrine of respondeat superior.

The court reversed appellant's conviction because the trial court erred in admitting evidence of sexual activities of others.

The only mitigating factor found by the trial court was the lack of significant criminal history. There was substantial evidence to support the conviction and the findings of aggravating factors. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred by failing to grant a mistrial when it was disclosed during the trial that another defendant had been convicted. This court, however, held that the evidence was admissible under the circumstances of the case and that there was no absolute necessity to declare a mistrial. Defendant also argued that because a co-participant in the murder received a sentence of years, the imposition of the death penalty against defendant was unconstitutionally applied. However, defendant formulated the plan to kill the victim and was the actual perpetrator of the crime. The convictions and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and the death sentence imposed upon him. A review of the record showed no error and showed that capital punishment was warranted. The sentence should not be reduced merely because another participant received a sentence for a term of years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's car insurance policy with appellee included uninsured motorist coverage on two vehicles, each vehicle carrying uninsured motorist coverage for injury or death of one person and for each occurrence.

The insured filed suit for declaratory judgment alleging he had access to $ 200,000 uninsured motorist coverage for the death of each child and that the uninsured motorist coverage was excess over the liability coverage of the other person involved in the accident. The insured alleged he was entitled to stack the coverages applicable to each of the two vehicles for the claim of each decedent. On appeal, the court reversed that part of the judgment finding that application of Fla. Stat. &sect; 627.4132, regarding the stacking of coverage, to appellant's insurance contract did not violate the Florida constitution.

The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to empanel a new jury for re-sentencing because the matter was remanded solely for the purpose of ensuring that appellant had an opportunity to challenge the presentence report, which was accomplished by correcting the record.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged with violations of the lottery laws and were adjudged guilty and sentenced.

The supreme court disagreed and held that the statute under attack was constitutional. The legislature, while it did not legalize any gambling device that would in effect amount to a lottery, had inherent power to regulate or to prohibit any and all other forms of gambling. Recognizing the vice of lotteries, the legislature had written into ch. 849.093 stringent limitations against abuse. The statute, which permitted non-profit and veterans' organizations to play only bingo and guest games, provided a source of recreation and social intercourse, and, thus, promoted the general welfare. Additionally, the statute removed bingo profits from the purview of organized gambling.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">By consolidated appeals from the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit (Florida), the court was asked to review substantially identical orders that passed upon the constitutionality of a theft statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 812.014(1) (1977). The trial court dismissed informations that charged defendants with various theft offenses because the legislature's revision rendered the statute unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In consolidated appeals, the prosecution sought review of substantially identical orders that held the state's theft statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 812.014(1) (1977), was unconstitutional. The trial judge granted defendants' motions to dismiss the informations that charged them with various theft offenses and concluded that the legislature's revision of the statute left it worded in such a way as to render it unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The trial judge found two features of the statute to be fatally defective. First, noting that the predecessor larceny statute specifically proscribed commission of the offense &quot;with unlawful intent,&quot; the trial judge ruled that the deletion of the word &quot;unlawful&quot; in the revised statute eliminated the element of specific criminal intent, thereby contravening due process requirements. Second, the trial court found that the term &quot;endeavors&quot; as used in ch. 812.014(1) was impermissibly vague. The appellate court disagreed and reversed the orders dismissing the informations against defendants. The court held that there was no evidence to support the notion that omission of the word &quot;unlawful&quot; eliminated specific criminal intent as an element of theft.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the orders that dismissed the informations against defendants and the cases were remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the court's opinion that the jurisprudence of the state recognized the element of specific criminal intent as a necessary requisite to a larceny conviction, notwithstanding that the larceny statute lacked an express directive that the intent was &quot;unlawful.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's decision and held that appellees, illegitimate children, were the natural children of decedent and could take equal shares in decedent's estate with all decedent's natural children. The court also affirmed the trial court's decision that the applicable probate statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 731.29(1) (1973), was unconstitutional. The statute required a written acknowledgement of paternity by the father of an illegitimate child in order for the child to inherit from the natural father. The court held that the appropriate test to determine whether the statute violated principles of equal protection was to examine whether the statutory differentiation on the basis of illegitimacy was justified by the promotion of recognized state objectives. The court held that the state did have a legitimate interest in protecting the orderly descent of its citizens' property, however, less stringent means were available to effectuate that objective. The court noted that the current version of the contested statute allowed for paternity to be established by a writing or by adjudication, thereby promoting state objectives without unduly punishing illegitimate children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's decision that held that appellees, illegitimate children, were decedent's natural children and were entitled to equal shares in decedent's estate with decedent's natural children. The court held that a statute that required appellees' father to acknowledge paternity in writing was unconstitutional because the statutory differentiation for illegitimate children was not justified by recognized state objectives.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the repealed statute dealt with conflict between official duties and private interests of public officials as it applied to public works contracts. The was straight on point as far as it applied to appellee, but for the enactment of ch. 112.314(1), which was broader and proscribed the transaction of any business in an employee's official capacity with any business entity of which he had an interest. The court held that when the broader statute was passed adding criminal penalties, ch. 839.07 (1973)'s vitality disappeared. Therefore, appellee, who took part in awarding a public works contract to a company in which he had an interest, was not subject to prosecution under ch. 839.07 (1973) because the statute was void by implication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari directed to the First District Court of Appeal (Florida), contending that the court erred when it affirmed a judgment that a complaint challenging an ad valorem real property tax assessment need not be filed within the 60-day period prescribed by Fla. Stat. ch. 194.171(2) (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner tax collector sought certiorari review of an appeals court judgment, which affirmed a trial court judgment that a complaint challenging an ad valorem real property tax assessment need not be filed within the 60-day period prescribed by Fla. Stat. ch. 194.171(2) (1975). Respondent taxpayers' basis for challenging the formulation stemmed from the use of the term &quot;statute of limitations&quot; in binding precedent, and the reluctance of lower courts to treat the statute as jurisdictional. Recognizing that its decision was in conflict with those of other courts, the appeals court nonetheless held that the statute did not create a jurisdictional bar to the commencement of a tax assessment challenge. The court indicated that the resulting conflict could be remedied by the state supreme court. However, the supreme court held that to remedy the conflict it was required to quash the appeals court's judgment because neither the lower courts nor respondents had suggested any invalidity or defect in the reasoning that prompted an early characterization of the statute as one of jurisdictional non-claim, rather than as one establishing an affirmative defense of the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment, which held that a complaint challenging an ad valorem real property tax assessment did not have to be filed in 60 days, was quashed because while an inappropriate label was attached to the statute by a recent decision, the substance and purpose for the statute was not altered, and there was no reason to recede from earlier decisions that the statute created a jurisdictional bar to the commencement of a tax assessment challenge.</SPAN></P>

The motion was dismissed, and appellant was convicted. On review, appellant argued that the statute making child sexual battery a crime was vague, that his motion to dismiss the indictment should have been granted because death, a penalty for the charged crime, was cruel and unusual punishment in relation to the crime, and that punishment for the crime by life imprisonment without eligibility for parole until twenty five years were served in prison was cruel and unusual punishment. The court ruled that appellant was not under a sentence of death and that the punishment for a minimum of twenty five years service in prison was not decided against appellant. The court affirmed the judgment convicting appellant, concluding that members of the public could read the statutory definition of sexual battery and the statute which outlawed child sexual battery and know, without any difficulty, what conduct was outlawed.</SPAN></P>

No appeal was taken and that decree became final. In 1973, the trial court held respondent in contempt for assessing taxes on petitioner's undeveloped property. Relying on caselaw from another appellate district, the appellate court held that respondent was not estopped from asserting the invalidity of the agreement. The court quashed the appellate decision, holding that even though the earlier decree had erroneously allowed respondent to contract away its taxing powers, that final decree had been rendered by a court of proper jurisdiction and was binding in a second suit between the same parties.

Appellee and manufacturer each paid one-third of the verdict, but appellant refused to pay its full share. Appellee paid the differential and filed suit against appellant under the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act (Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 768.31 (1975). Appellant moved to dismiss, asserting that the Act was unconstitutional as applied to municipal corporations. Affirming the lower court's judgment for appellee, the court first determined by reviewing legislative intent that municipal corporations were &quot;persons&quot; subject to the Act. The court then held that the Act neither affected appellant's vested rights nor imposed on it any new duty. Instead, the Act lessened appellant's potential liability at common law by equitably dividing it among all offenders. Thus, application of the Act to appellee's case, pending when the statute was enacted, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act applied to municipal corporations and was constitutionally applied to cases pending at the time the statute was enacted.</SPAN></P>

After receiving a statement of particulars, appellant filed three motions to dismiss. The first motion sought dismissal on the grounds that appellant had been illegally detained and arrested. Appellant then filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.190(c)(4), alleging that there were no material disputed facts and the undisputed facts did not establish a prima facie case on any of the three counts. The final motion to dismiss filed by appellant was directed solely to the counts charging false imprisonment and alleged that ch. 787.02 was facially unconstitutional in that it was vague, indefinite, and ambiguous. The trial court denied all three motions. Appellant thereafter pled nolo contendere to all three counts and was adjudicated guilty of each. The court affirmed and held that the wording of ch. 787.02 was sufficiently explicit and not so vague that persons of common intelligence were required to guess at its meaning and differed as to its application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, intervening cemetery company, challenged an order of the lower court holding that a portion of the state's cemetery licensing statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 559.39(2)(1977), was unconstitutional and improperly applied and ruling that appellee state comptroller improperly denied the license application of appellee, intervening cemetery company. The court declined to rule on the constitutionality of the statute, finding that its holding that the denial of the license request was improper obviated the need to address that issue. The court held that appellee comptroller erroneously considered new statutory criteria in denying the license, which amounted to an improper retrospective application of the statute. The court further determined that the filing of a declaratory judgment action and petition for mandamus were appropriate, despite the lack of exhaustion of administrative remedies, because the circuit court had jurisdiction to enjoin enforcement of facially unconstitutional agency rules without exhaustion of remedies, and Fla. Stat. ch. 86.011(2)(1975) provided for the request of coercive relief in conjunction with a declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner state brought criminal charges against respondents for the criminal sale of unregistered securities. Respondents claimed that Fla. Stat. ch. 517.17, which put upon respondents the burden of establishing the right to a statutory exemption, violated their constitutional rights to due process and their privilege against self-incrimination. The trial court agreed and declared the statute unconstitutional. Petitioner appealed the trial court's order to the district court of appeal, which in turn transferred the appeal to the court. The court reversed the trial court's order and remanded for further consistent proceedings. The lack of an exemption was not an element of the offense of sale of an unregistered security as defined in Fla. Stat. ch. 517.07. Rather, the existence of an exemption was a defense available to respondents. There was no due process violation in requiring respondents to plead and prove their defense. Similarly, the privilege against self-incrimination was not violated by the availability of a defense where respondents would be required to break their silence to assert the defense.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's order denied the motion and upheld the law. The trial court convicted appellant. Appellant challenged the conviction. Appellant argued that the definition of chemical substance in ch. 877.11(2) was overly broad because it included a range of ordinary products beyond just those intended to be prohibited. Appellant argued that although the law was limited to certain physical states resulting from inhalation, it remained overbroad because those conditions were subjective and occurred from non-criminalized causes. Appellant alleged the statute's language did not clearly inform an average person of what conduct was prohibited. The court agreed with appellant's contentions and ruled the law unconstitutional.

Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 914.04 (1975), both were granted immunity in exchange for their testimony regarding the financial affairs of their law partner for possible criminal charges. Petitioners were of the opinion that the immunity granted extended to disciplinary proceedings brought by respondent state bar. Respondent commenced disciplinary proceedings against petitioners based upon those transactions involved in the criminal investigation. By petition for writ of prohibition, petitioners requested the court to halt further action by respondent, claiming disciplinary immunity. The court held that a grant of immunity under the statute did not immunize attorneys from disciplinary proceedings instituted or imposed by or under authority of the rules of the court. However, the court held that where it appeared that the greater good to society would be served by granting immunity from disciplinary action to an attorney, it would do so.

The court found that petitioner's proposal would have violated due process because it would have permitted one party to discuss the merits of a case with the judges while excluding other parties. The court rejected petitioner's argument that the rules had to be in substantial compliance with the model rules, finding that pursuant to Fla.

I, &sect; 5. On review, the state supreme court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 112.532(3) was constitutionally valid. However, the supreme court determined that appellant had no right to sue for defamation greater than any right under Florida law without Fla. Stat. ch. 112.532(3). Accordingly, the supreme court reversed the summary judgment granted in favor of appellee and remanded the action to the trial court so that appellant could have the opportunity to amend his complaint to bring an action for libel against appellee.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 847.04 (1975) was reversed because the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. While a police officer was present at appellant's father's house, appellant made derogatory comments about appellant's father. Appellant was charged with open profanity. Appellant brought a motion to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motion and entered appellant's conviction pursuant to a plea of nolo contendere. Appellant sought review, claiming that the statute improperly sought to regulate pure speech and was vague. The state supreme court reversed appellant's conviction, holding that the statute was unconstitutional. Because the statute was vague and sought to regulate speech that was neither &quot;fighting words&quot; nor directed at anyone in particular, appellant's conviction under the statute was improper.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court quashed the district court's decision which reversed respondent's conviction for obtaining property in return for a worthless check pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 832.05 on the grounds that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to instruct the jury that intent to defraud was an element of the offense. The district court had certified two questions essentially asking whether intent to defraud was an essential element of the crime of obtaining property by a worthless check. The court held that it was not. The criminal offense of obtaining property in return for a worthless check, described in Fla. Stat. ch. 832.05, required as an essential element knowledge of insufficient funds on deposit in the bank on which the check was drawn, but it did not require intent to defraud. Further, the court rejected respondent's argument that the statute was unconstitutional under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, the provision barring imprisonment for debt except in cases of fraud. The purpose of the provision was not the collection of debts, but the banning of the circulation of worthless commercial paper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A witness heard touch tone telephone sounds coming from the area around defendant as he talked on a public telephone.

After defendant was convicted, he contended that chapter 817.482 was unconstitutionally vague and the information did not adequately advise him of the charge against him. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and upheld the statute. The statute was not vague because it sufficiently explained the offensive conduct.

Defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for 125 years pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 812.13 (1975). Defendant argued that a sentence in excess of life expectancy was unlawful under Fla. Stat. ch. 812.13 (1975). Specifically, defendant contended that his imprisonment could not be for a term of years exceeding life imprisonment. The state supreme court reviewed the sentencing guidelines under Fla. Stat. ch. 812.13 (1975). The supreme court held that life expectancy was irrelevant to limitations on terms of incarceration for criminal misconduct. Although a sentence of 125 years imprisonment presumptively exceeded the life expectancy of defendant, the practical effect was no harsher than if a trial court had imposed the maximum sentence of life. The supreme court affirmed the conviction and sentence entered against defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee was issued a traffic citation and charged with a second degree misdemeanor when for refusing to sign the summons as required by Fla.

Appellee moved to dismiss on the grounds that the statute's title failed to notify the public that the statute created a criminal penalty for willful refusal to sign a traffic citation and based on violation of the single-subject rule. The lower court granted the motion, and the prosecution appealed pursuant to Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 3(b)(1). The court held that under Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6, for a legislative enactment to fail, the conflict between it and the state constitution had to be palpable, and the requirement that the title explain the statute only required that everything in the statute was reasonably related to the title.

After a non-jury trial, appellant was found guilty as charged. Prior to sentencing, appellant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal court, alleging ch. 796.07(3)(c) was unconstitutional. The federal court held that appellant did not have to exhaust her state remedies and stayed all proceedings against appellant in the state court, including sentencing. The federal circuit court reversed and directed appellant to exhaust her state remedies. Subsequently, appellant was adjudicated guilty. Appellant sought review. The circuit court transferred the matter to the court. The court affirmed the conviction and the order that held ch. 796.07(3)(c) was constitutional because ch. 796.07(3)(c) was not unconstitutionally vague, and the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 827.03(3) sufficiently conveyed a definite warning to defendant as to the type of conduct that would render him liable to its penalties. Therefore, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague or overly broad in content.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee, an importer/exporter of wholesale liquor, filed suit against appellant state regulatory agency regarding a statute requiring appellee to obtain a license before transporting &quot;in-bond&quot; goods for out-of-state distribution and use, Fla. Stat. ch. 561.14(4) (1975). The trial court held that the statute violated the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. Affirming that decision, the court noted that the state's sole interest was to prevent a diversion of liquor from foreign commerce into the stream of state distribution. In that vein, the state had imposed licensing, bonding, reporting, and inventory regulations on liquor importer/exporters such as appellee. But, the federal government's extensive regulations governing liquor transfer through the state more than adequately addressed the state's concern. State regulations merely duplicated the federal effort. The court thus held that the supplementary regulations set forth in Fla. Stat. ch. 561 (1975) were an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. The court noted that its ruling did not prohibit a state from requiring that exporters register with the state for identification purposes.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 78.068 (1976) did not fail to meet due process requirements of either the state or federal constitution. Appellee creditors brought actions to obtain pre-judgment writs of replevin against appellant debtors, which would allow appellees to take property from appellants prior to judgment. The writs were issued according to procedure set forth under ch. 78.068 and appellants filed motions to dissolve the writs on the basis that the replevin statute violated their due process rights and was therefore unconstitutional. The court found that ch. 78.068 met the five part test for minimum due process requirements.

Stat. ch. 839.25(1)(c ) to be vague and susceptible to arbitrary application in violation of Fla. Const. art I, &sect; 9 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 839.25(1)(c ) was unconstitutional under the due process guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. In two separate cases, defendants, who were city employees, were charged with official misconduct under ch. 839.25(1)(c ). The court held that under ch. 839.25(1)(c ), official misconduct was the violation by any public servant of any statute, rule, or regulation pertaining to the office of the accused, whether they contain criminal penalties or not and regardless of how minor or trivial. A public servant was defined in a related statute as any public officer, agent, or governmental employee, whether elected or appointed. The court held that although ch. 839.25(1)(c ) required that the public servant's act be committed with corrupt intent, this standard was too vague to give men of common intelligence sufficient warning of what is corrupt and outlawed because all that is necessary for intent to be corrupt is that it be done with knowledge that the act is wrongful and with improper motive. Therefore, the court found that ch. 839.25(1)(c ) did not limit prosecutorial discretion in any reasonable way.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted on two counts of murder in the first degree. The jury recommended and the trial judge imposed a sentence of death. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion for change of venue. It was his contention that, due to pretrial publicity, it was impossible for him to receive a fair and impartial trial in the county as several prospective jurors knew one of the victims or knew witnesses who would testify at trial. The court noted that knowledge of the incident because of its notoriety was not, in and of itself, grounds for a change of venue. The test for determining a change of venue was whether the general state of mind of the inhabitants of a community was so infected by knowledge of the incident and accompanying prejudice, bias, and preconceived opinions that jurors could not possibly put these matters out of their minds. The prospective jurors, when questioned, stated that they could decide the issues between the state and the appellant based upon the evidence heard and the exhibits examined in the courtroom. Nothing in the record to indicated that the trial judge abused his discretion in denying appellant's motion for change of venue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee non-resident parent corporation and its subsidiaries commenced suit under Fla. Stat. ch. 199.242(1) to contest intangible personal property tax assessments rendered against them by appellant state agency. Appellant challenged the final judgment in appellees' favor, arguing that the trial court erred in concluding that the statute was unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. In affirming, the state supreme court concluded that the statute violated the principles of equal protection in that the unequal treatment of identical receivables was based solely on the residence of the parent corporation and was not differentiated in any way on the basis of where the receivable arose or its actual contacts with the state. While the state enjoyed a wide latitude in placing conditions upon the entry of foreign corporations to transact business within its borders, once a foreign corporation had been admitted to transact business therein, it must be afforded equal protection of the laws of the admitting state to the same extent as domiciliary corporations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Certiorari was granted to review a decision of the First District Court of Appeal (Florida), which affirmed a Public Employees Relations Commission order holding that a sheriff was a public employer within the definition of Fla. Stat. ch. 447.203(2) (1975) and that a deputy sheriff was a public employee within the definition of Fla. Stat. ch. 447.203(3) (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent associations filed petitions for certification with the Public Employees Relations Commission (PERC), seeking certification as representatives of certain deputy sheriffs for the purpose of collective bargaining. Petitioner sheriffs filed motions to dismiss the petitions, asserting that sheriffs were not public employers under Fla. Stat. ch. 447 (1975). PERC denied the motions, and the court of appeal upheld the decision. The supreme court affirmed the court of appeal's conclusion that the definition of &quot;public employer&quot; in ch. 447.203(2) encompassed sheriffs. The court determined that a public office was an agency of the state and that the constitutionally created office of sheriff was an agency of the sovereign power from which it derived its authority. The office of sheriff possessed the requisite control over the terms and conditions of its personnel's employment. However, the supreme court quashed the court of appeal's decision insofar as it held that a deputy sheriff was a public employee. The court found that the language of ch. 447 did not reveal legislative intent to include appointed deputy sheriffs within the definition of &quot;public employee.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Stat. chs. 934.02(2), 934.03, and 934.06 (1975), claiming that the statutes were overly broad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When prosecuting defendants for extortion, the state attempted to use as evidence an electronically recorded conservation between the victim and one defendant, in which defendant made threats. The recording was made without defendant's prior consent, however, and law enforcement officials were not involved in the recording. The trial court granted a motion to suppress, and the supreme court affirmed. The supreme court held that an extortionary threat delivered personally to the victim at home was an &quot;oral communication&quot; under Fla. Stat. ch. 934.02(2), but that the electronic recording of such oral communication without the consent of all parties to the communication was prohibited by Fla. Stat. ch. 934.03, and Fla. Stat. ch. 934.06 expressly prohibited the use of such electronic recordings as evidence. The court found that because the electronic recording did not fall within any of the situations permitting interception under Fla. Stat. ch. 934.03(2), ch. 934.06 contained no exception to the prohibition against its use. The supreme court held that Fla. Stat. chs. 934.02(2), 934.03, 934.06 (1975), were clear, unambiguous, and not overly broad and were, therefore, constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed a judgment of the trial court that suppressed an electronic recording of a conversation between the victim and defendant, in which defendant made extortionary threats to the victim, because defendant never gave prior consent to the recording. Therefore, pursuant to statute the recording could not be used as evidence. The court held that the statutes at issue were not unconstitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees were charged with petit larceny, having twice previously been convicted of that offense.

The court reversed and remanded, finding the statute was constitutional. The court overruled the holding of Nichols v. State, 231 So.2d 526 (Fla. 2nd DCA 1970) to the extent it allowed prosecutors to present to the jury the issue of the historical fact of a prior conviction or convictions. The court found the statute created a substantive offense to be tried in the circuit court when felony petit larceny was charged, without bringing to the jury's attention the fact of prior convictions as an element of the new charge. The court held the trial court, in a separate proceeding, was to determine the historical fact of prior convictions and questions regarding identity in accord with general principles of law and by following the procedures in Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court heard consolidated appeals from two county courts that found the Florida Insurance and Tort Reform Act of 1977 (act), 1977 Fla.

The act created an incentive fund for good drivers to encourage safe driving and allowed assessment of civil penalties for certain traffic violations. The court found that only 1977 Fla. Laws ch. 77-468, &sect; 42, was unconstitutional because it improperly used police power to take private property from one group of individuals solely for the benefit of another, limited class of individuals; it violated equal protection; and it violated U.S. Const. art. III, &sect; 6, which mandated that a law must embrace only one subject matter. The state's police power could not be invoked to distribute funds arbitrarily and discriminatorily to a special class of private individuals. The court found that 1977 Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of denial of its motion to dissolve writ of garnishment, premised on appellee's judgment against debtor, challenging the constitutionality of Fla.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 77.01 &amp; 77.03 (1975), based on failure to provide appellant with prior notice and opportunity to be heard on issue of whether it, in fact, held wages or other monies owing to the garnishment of debtor. The court determined the statutes were constitutional where neither due process clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, nor any provision of Fla. Const. required prior notice to debtor, or hearing on entitlement to an exemption before writ of garnishment issued. The court also held it was abuse of discretion not to dissolve default against appellant where it did not have actual notice of the proceedings against it, and appellee should have had no greater rights against appellant than debtor would have had. Accordingly, statutes were held to be constitutional, and the case was remanded with directions to dissolve default and set aside the final judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner appealed an order of the lower court that found the bifurcated trial system established by Fla. Stat. ch. 921.131(1), for the adjudication of guilt and insanity in criminal trials, denied a defendant his right to due process of law under the state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was charged with burglary and entered a plea of not guilty with intent to rely on the defense of insanity. Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss, challenging the constitutionality of the statute that provided for a separate trial on the issue of insanity following trial on the issue of guilt. The trial judge ruled that Fla. Stat. ch. 921.131(1), which provided for a separate trial on insanity, constituted a denial of due process, but upheld the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 921.131(10), which repealed Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.210. Thus, the trial court held the defense of insanity no longer existed. The court found that an insanity defense existed at common law, thus the court found that an insanity defense remained in existence. The court also found that the bifurcated trial system denied petitioner the right to due process of law because intent was an element to most crimes, and under the bifurcated trial system no evidence of insanity was admissible during the guilt or innocence stage of the trial, which gave an irrebuttable presumption that the intent existed. Creation of that presumption would alleviate the state from proving each element beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment of the lower court that found relevant state statute was unconstitutional was affirmed because bifurcation of the trial of guilt and the trial on insanity violated petitioner's due process rights. The court found that because an insanity defense existed at common law, the trial court should not have found that an insanity defense did not exist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant leaseholders sought review of a judgment from the trial court (Florida) that found for appellees and held that 1976 Fla. Laws. ch. 361, pertaining to reductions in lease payments to a state agency commensurate with the assessment of ad valorem taxes on the leasehold property, created an indirect exemption from taxation which violated Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3 (1968).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Finding that an effective exemption from ad valorem taxes unconstitutionally favored appellant leaseholders over other taxpayers, the court affirmed the judgment. At least some appellants obtained leaseholds from a state agency while the leaseholds were not subject ad valorem taxes under a prior law. The exemption was subsequently repealed; the legislature later allowed appellants to offset, by 1976 Fla. Laws ch. 361, their rent by the amount of the ad valorem taxes. Holding that ch. 361 effected an unconstitutional exemption from ad valorem taxes not authorized by Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3 (1968), the court affirmed the judgment for appellees. The court held that ch. 361 was a tax relief bill, notwithstanding the legislative findings of fact in the preamble to ch. 361, which couched the bill in terms of equitable or contractual relief. To the contrary, the court found that the county had not been unjustly enriched by improvements made to the leaseholds, that it was clear from many leases that no promise not to levy ad valorem taxes had been made to appellants, and that certain appellants who obtained leases after repeal of the exemption actually reaped a windfall from ch. 361.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment for appellees, and held that a statute allowing an offset to rent due a state agency for ad valorem taxes on property the state let to appellant leaseholders was an unconstitutional tax relief measure. The court pierced the legislative findings in support of the statute, noting that the findings were mere conclusions largely contrary to the actual facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the County Court of Polk County (Florida), which convicted him of the use of open profanity as proscribed by Fla. Stat. ch. 847.04 (1975). Appellant alleged that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague and violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of shouting obscenities in public within earshot of his father and other bystanders. The court, finding that Fla. Stat. ch. 847.04 (1975) lacked statutory language to support an authoritative construction that it only criminalized the use of &quot;fighting words,&quot; held that the statute violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 4, and reversed appellant's conviction. In doing so, it receded from State v. Mayhew, 288 So.2d 243 (Fla. 1973). The court distinguished ch. 847.04 from other profanity laws which were constitutional, or had been held capable of a constitutional construction. The court noted that ch. 847.04 barred the use of profane, vulgar, and indecent language without reference to its effect on a person hearing the language. The court stated that what had saved, or could have saved, the other statutes was their inclusion of a standard that arguably brought the profanity within the &quot;fighting words&quot; exception to free speech. While the court emphasized that it always tried to construe a statute to uphold its constitutionality, it could not do so in this case, given the dearth of legislative expression of intent to criminalize the use only of &quot;fighting words.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed appellant's conviction for the use of profane language. The court found no statutory language to support an authoritative construction limiting the criminalized speech to &quot;fighting words.&quot; Absent such support, the court could not embark on a wholesale judicial rewriting of the statute to cause it to conform to the constitutional dictates of free speech. The court receded from State v. Mayhew.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the ordinance did not violate Fla. Const. art.

Appellant argued that the statute unconstitutionally violated her U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV rights because it was vague, overbroad, and included a prohibition against using constitutionally protected words. The court overturned appellant's conviction and struck the first portion of the statute because it was not narrowly tailored to further a legitimate state interest and encompassed speech protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of violating Fla. Stat. ch. 849.06 (1975), which criminalized permitting anyone under the age of 21, other than those in the armed services, to frequent any billiard hall other than in so-called bona fide bowling establishments. On appeal, the state supreme court vacated appellant's conviction, finding ch. 849.06 to be violative of both the federal and state constitutions. The court reasoned that in order to survive equal protection analysis the state's classification was required to rest on a distinction which bore a just and reasonable relation to the statute in respect to the classification proposed. With respect to ch. 849.06, however, the court could find no reasonable relation at all. Even if billiard halls were frequented by an undesirable element from whom those under the age of 21 were required to be protected, that element was just as likely to frequent a bowling alley.</SPAN></P>

Appellant county bar association president appealed the judgment and alleged that the statutes were overbroad and unconstitutional. The judgment of the lower court was affirmed. The court held that the statutes at issue were not overbroad or unconstitutional because the legislature did not attempt to exempt organizations, such as the county judicial trust fund, that set up their own procedures for policing themselves. The court agreed that the trust met the definition of a political committee found in ch. 106.011, and, therefore, it was subject to the limitations on contributions found in ch. 106.08.

The court ruled that the peculiar features of condominium development, ownership, and operation indicated the wisdom of providing a procedural vehicle for the settlement of disputes affecting condominium owners concerning matters of common interest. Thus, regarding the common interests recited in rule 1.220(b), a condominium association was properly construed to represent the class composed of its members as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the petition to modify the rules of civil procedure that expressly declared condominium association members a class as a matter of law. The peculiar features of condominium development, ownership, and operation warranted the creation of a procedural vehicle, which the legislature had no authority to create, for settlement of disputes affecting condominium owners concerning matters of common interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees owned a tract of land that was zoned agricultural but not classified as such for tax purposes. Appellees initiated a declaratory judgment action seeking to have their property taxed as agricultural property. The trial court entered judgment in their favor because the classification statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 193.461(3)(b) (1975), was unconstitutional. The trial court also found that appellees' property was assessed without any regard for the factors listed in Fla. Stat. ch. 193.011 (1973). On appeal, the court affirmed the decision regarding the assessment factors but found the classification statute constitutional. The tax assessor incorrectly relied on speculative factors in evaluating appellees' land and failed to consider appellees' current use of the land. The classification statute did not limit agricultural classification to commercially profitable operations because the tax assessor merely relied on profit as another factor in assessing whether the claimed agricultural use was bona fide.</SPAN></P>

The tax assessor failed to consider appellees' current use of their property. The classification statute was constitutional because it did not limit the agricultural classification to only profitable agricultural operations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was adjudicated delinquent and placed on probation for violation of Fla.

Lower court denied appellant's motion for new trial, holding that Fla. Stat. ch. 871.01 was constitutional and applicable. Appellant sought review pursuant to Fla. Const. art V, &sect; 3(b)(1), arguing the statute was constitutionally void for overbreadth and that his activity was protected based on precedent arising under Fla. Stat. ch. 877.03, the breach of the peace statute. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 877.03 did not apply, since Fla. Stat. ch. 877.01 was a more explicit statute dealing with disturbance of a lawful assembly.

In affirming, the supreme court held that a suit against a state agency had to be filed in the county where the agency maintained its principal headquarters.

In order to construct an office and banking facility appellants sought to have the two parcels' zoning changed from residential to Administrative/Professional. Upon denial, appellants filed an action for declaratory relief on the grounds that Section 2-46 of the Gainesville Code was unconstitutional and that the denial of the zoning application was arbitrary and unreasonable and therefore an unlawful taking. Appellants filed an interlocutory appeal, which the court considered as a petition for a writ of certiorari. The court concluded that the ordinance was valid and desirable. Both the public interests and private interests were considered with the resultant effect that the public interests were paramount, but not in derogation of the private interests where a valid protest was made.</SPAN></P>

In accordance with the rule of law pronounced in Gardner, the supreme court ordered the sentencing judge to state whether he based his sentencing decision upon any information not known to defendant. The trial judge responded that he did not consider any information unknown to defendant. However, during the course of clemency proceedings, the governor wrote defendant's attorney and enclosed a copy of the confidential evaluation portion of the presentence investigation, which indicated that the sentencing judge was &quot;made aware&quot; of some of the confidential facts by the supervisor. As a result, defendant filed a motion to vacate his sentence, arguing that the sentencing judge did not comply with the requirements of Gardner. The court denied the motion and held that although a sentencing judge may be &quot;aware&quot; of other factors, in the exercise of his discretion he does not necessarily &quot;consider&quot; the factors. The court determined that the sentencing judge did not consider the factors when he made his sentencing decision and that he complied with the requirements of Gardner.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 934.03(2)(d) (1974), relating to the interception of oral or wire communications, to be unconstitutional, in a suit by appellee news organizations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Fla. Stat. ch. 934.03(2)(d) (1974) required that all parties to a wire or oral communication give prior consent before the interception of the communication by any person was lawful. Holding that the U.S. Const. amend. I did not invalidate every incidental burdening of the press that might result from the enforcement of civil or criminal statutes of general applicability, the court declared ch. 934.03(2)(d) constitutional, and reversed the judgment for appellee news organizations. The court noted that ch. 934.03(2)(d) was not a restraint or restriction on what the press could publish, nor contained an expressed or implied command that the press publish that which it preferred to withhold. Rather, the court said that it was a legislative decision to enforce an expectation of privacy that a party to a conversation had regarding interception of that communication. The court concluded that the U.S. Const. amend.

The court held that such allegations placed petitioners within the reach of the long arm statute and satisfied the minimum contacts required by the federal constitution.

The court considered whether &quot;capital&quot; crimes committed during the period when capital crimes did not exist in Florida were subject to the two-year statute of limitations. The petitioners argued that they should be released on the grounds that the statute of limitations had run prior to the filing of the indictment. The court concluded that it was inescapable from the holdings in relevant case law, from a plain reading of Fla. Stat. ch. 932.465 (1973), and from any proper construction of that statute based on legislative intent, that prosecution for offenses committed during the period from July 24, 1972, to October 1, 1972, had to have begun within two years from the date of such offense in order to comply with law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant nurse challenged her conviction from the Seventeenth Circuit Court, Broward County (Florida) for the unlawful termination of a pregnancy resulting in the pregnant woman's death in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 458.22(2). Appellant argued, inter alia, that the approved physician requirement of the statute was inextricably interwoven with unconstitutional approved facility portions so it must fall when they did.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant nurse was convicted of unlawful termination of a pregnancy resulting in the pregnant woman's death in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 458.22(2). Appellant was not a physician and was not in an approved facility when she performed the abortion. Appellant argued that the statute unconstitutionally infringed on privacy rights based on Roe and Doe decisions, as well as federal decisions in which the approved facility requirement in Fla. Stat. ch. 458.22(2) and all of (3) were declared unconstitutional. Appellant argued the statute's approved physician requirement was inextricably interwoven with the unconstitutional portions of statute so that it must fall. The court held because appellant was neither a pregnant woman entertaining the abortion decision nor a consulting physician, she had no privacy interest. Also, it was unconstitutional to apply the approved facility requirement. Where a statute contained valid and invalid provisions, the valid ones may be enforced provided they were severable. The opinion in Roe stated that states were free to require that abortions be performed by physicians and that requirement was severable from the approved facility requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed convicting appellant nurse of unlawful termination of a pregnancy resulting in the pregnant woman's death. The court held that although part of the state statute was unconstitutional, where a statute contained valid and invalid provisions, the valid ones may be enforced provided they were severable. States were free to require that abortions be performed by physicians.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 129.09 (1975) and Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 16. The court concluded appellee was county auditor, accountant, and custodian of all county funds pursuant to statutory and constitutional provisions. The court further determined pre-audits were conducted by appellee, while performance audits and post-audits were able to be made by an independent accountant. The court found the circuit court clerk office was able to be divided by general or special law between two officers and the clerk duties were able to be varied by county charter or special law approved by county electors. The court determined the clerk was responsible for submitting initial budget proposals for all constitutional officers to the county board. The court found Fla. Laws ch. 71-443 &sect;&sect; 3 and 4(b) were unconstitutional while Fla. Laws ch. 71-443 &sect;&sect; 1,2, and 4(a) were constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of murdering her husband. On appeal, the court upheld the validity of Fla. Stat. ch. 40.01(1) which exempted from jury duty expectant mothers and mothers with young children upon their request. U.S. Const. amend. VI required that no large distinctive groups could be excluded from a jury pool; however, mothers of young children were not so distinctive a class as to evoke constitutional concerns. The court upheld that validity of Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(1) that required a person convicted of a capital felony and sentenced to life imprisonment to serve no less than 25 years before becoming eligible for parole. Any sentence imposed within statutory limits would not violate Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Further, appellant's contentions regarding the constitutional validity had been previously rebutted. However, the court reversed and remanded after concluding that the state did not carry its burden of disproving appellant's innocence. Even thought circumstantial evidence was sufficient to suggest a probability of guilt, it was not adequate to support a conviction if it was likewise consistent with a reasonable hypothesis of innocence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was sentenced to death for first degree murder. Under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, appellant moved for postconviction relief. The trial court denied relief. Appellant sought review, requesting a stay of execution. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of relief and accordingly denied the stay of execution. The principal point raised by appellant concerned an assertion that certain jurors were improperly excluded from the jury panel from which the jury was selected. The court held that the affirmative exclusion by appellant, coupled with the failure to raise the issue of an alleged systematic exclusion of jurors at the time of the original appeal, waived the right to raise that claim at this stage in the proceedings. The remaining issues, including a confession issue, were rejected in accordance with United States Supreme Court precedent. The court served notice that it would refuse to entertain any petition for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied appellant's request for a stay of execution, affirming the trial court's denial of appellant's motion for postconviction relief, because appellant waived any right to appeal the allegedly improper exclusion of certain jurors where the issue was not raised on direct appeal from the trial court's imposition of the death penalty upon appellant's conviction. In view of controlling precedent, the remaining issues lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found appellant to be dependent and committed him to the Division of Youth Services (DYS) because he was ungovernable under Fla. Stat. ch. 39.10. The court affirmed the decision that Fla. Stat. ch. 39.01(11) was constitutional, as the court had recently rejected appellant's contention that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court reversed the order that committed appellant to DYS. The trial court impermissibly attempted to treat appellant as a delinquent by committing him to DYS. A proceeding seeking an adjudication of delinquency had to be initiated by the state attorney or it was defective. An official at appellant's remediation program filed the petition that led to appellant's commission to DYS. The petition was insufficient to support an order treating appellant as a delinquent because it failed to allege that appellant had been previously adjudicated an ungovernable child. The charging petition alleged that appellant was a dependent/ungovernable child, but to treat a child as a delinquent notice to that effect had to be given.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of premeditated murder and sentenced to death. Appellant did not challenge his conviction on appeal but directed all assignments of error to the sentencing portion of the trial. The judgment of the lower court was affirmed. The court held that the issue of adequacy of representation was raised for the first time on appeal. Because the error was not fundamental, the court refused to address it because it was not preserved for appeal. Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141 (1975) was constitutional. Appellant was not denied due process of law based on the prosecutor's comments. The comments were not so prejudicial as to require a new trial. Additionally, appellant was barred from raising the issue because he failed to object to the alleged improper comments at trial. Some of the prosecutor's comments had a basis in the record and, therefore, were proper. The court found that there were no mitigating circumstances in considering appellant's sentence. The lower court improperly combined two aggravating factors, but the remaining aggravating factors were sufficient to justify the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

He moved to dismiss the information against him because it included extraneous language that had been stricken from the statute by an amendment effective before the date of his alleged offense. The trial court denied his motion. However, the trial court granted his second motion to dismiss, in which he asserted that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The reviewing court affirmed the denial of his first motion, but reversed and remanded for consistent action on his second, finding that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. Specifically, the reviewing court rejected appellee's assertion that members of the public could not be expected to understand the meaning of culpable negligence, and therefore, that they could not know what acts were proscribed, holding that whether members of the public would describe reckless acts which created a great risk of danger to others as culpable negligence or not, they knew that such acts were criminally outlawed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted appellees' motion to dismiss because it lacked jurisdiction over appellees and over the cause pursuant to Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3, and art.

The court held that multi-member districts were not per se invalid. Further, court held that since petitioners did not contend that the districts objected to discriminated against them from their inception, they had failed to state a cause for relief under the jurisdiction the court had retained when it initially declared the apportionment valid in a prior decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As the result of a tax assessment of its real property, appellant corporation brought a mandamus action against appellee county property appraiser, seeking to require appellee to break appellant's real estate holdings into parcels in order to utilize Pope's Law, Fla. Stat. ch. 194.042(1)(b) (1975), to prove its claim that the tax assessments were excessive. The trial court declared the statute unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the ruling. The court agreed with the trial court's finding that ch. 194.042 violated the just valuation criterion of Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4. The court explained that just valuation was synonymous with fair market value, which was defined as the amount a willing purchaser would pay to a willing seller. The alternative valuation under ch. 194.042, which ascertained how substantial a cash offer would be made for property when a buyer realized that the sale was contingent upon the owner's willingness to sell, was not a suitable procedure for determining fair market value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of obtaining welfare assistance by fraud in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 409.325 (1). On review, appellant argued that &sect; 409.325 (1) was unconstitutionally vague because it lacked requirements and conditions sufficiently specific to protect someone, who, although technically not qualified to receive public welfare, did so in good faith. The court ruled that the language was sufficient to notify the public of the conduct it prohibited. Further, the court held that the statutory requirement which cured appellant's objection was that before guilt could be established one must have fraudulently and by misrepresentation secured public assistance for himself or assisted others in receiving it, and that this requirement alerted the public that the statute was aimed at those who, by malicious or deceitful motives, cheated the government by fraudulent conduct. The court affirmed the judgment convicting appellant, concluding that so long as a statute was sufficient to advise the average citizen of common intelligence who could be involved, of the offense proscribed, it withstood the assault of vagueness and that &sect; 409.325 (1) met that standard.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court affirmed in part appellant's conviction. First, the supreme court held that it was by now well established that obscenity was not protected by U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV and was subject to limited regulation under the police power of the states. The supreme court then held that obscenity was defined by whether the materials were patently offensive as judged by the local county standard. The supreme court found that only one of the five magazines was patently offensive and affirmed that conviction. The supreme court further rejected appellant's argument that the information was legally insufficient. The supreme court held that the information sufficiently placed appellant on notice of the charges and prevented double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court rejected petitioner's argument that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence a photograph of the victim's body. The court held that the photograph was relevant to the details of the events leading up to the crime, in that it showed the location of the victim's body in relation to the restaurant which had been robbed. Additionally, the trial court did not err in directing the jury that it must find a unanimous verdict. When the instruction was considered in the context of the whole charge, it was clear that no pressure was placed on the jurors to return a verdict to which they did not agree. The trial court did not err in failing to instruct on second degree felony murder because the jury found that petitioner killed the victim during the course of a robbery, a form of murder described as &quot;first degree&quot; in Fla. Stat. ch. 782.04(1)(a) (1973). The death penalty was proper because there were no mitigating circumstances and adequate aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state sought review of the Pinellas County Court (Florida) order that dismissed informations filed against appellees and declared Florida's statute on unlawful assembly, Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found Fla. Stat. ch. 870.02 (1975) neither vague nor overbroad, and construed &quot;unlawful act&quot; to mean an unlawful criminal act. Nevertheless, it held that the statute violated U.S. Const. amend. I in that it attempted to regulate conduct that was protected by the Freedom of Assembly Clause contained in the First Amendment, and that it sought to make criminal the coming together without requiring affirmative action in furtherance of the breach of peace or other unlawful act. The statute made criminal an unlawful assembly in which those assembled intended to do an unlawful act that threatened a breach of the peace. The court held that it was not an abridgement of free speech or assembly to prohibit or make criminal an assembly that had as its purpose the breach of the peace. Thus, the statute was constitutional and the trial court's order was reversed in that respect. However, the dismissal of the informations against appellees was affirmed because each of the elements of the offenses were not itemized nor were facts articulated to establish the required elements. Such dismissals were without prejudice to the state to file amended informations.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's motion was denied. Appellant sought review of the adverse judgment. The court affirmed judgment for appellee prosecution because as used in the context of the statute, the words gaming and game, which referred to cards, dice, or billiards, were synonymous with gambling, and the wording of Fla.

Pursuant to appellee's motion to dismiss, the court issued an order finding that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. On appeal, the court held that the statute was not vague merely because it did not list every type of person who was authorized to ask a trespasser to leave, nor was it overbroad because it gave an authorized person discretion to ask a trespasser to leave public property. Whether the custodian had the actual or implied authority, or had abused his discretion, were issues to be decided at trial. Thus, the statute was constitutional. However, because the information failed to allege that appellee was ordered to leave the premises, it left out an element of the offense and was fatally defective. Therefore, the court affirmed the result, reversed the order finding &sect; 810.09 (1975) unconstitutional, and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a school board and its insurer, filed a motion to suppress from trial any mention of insurance and to sever appellant insurer from the trial. The trial judge denied appellants' motion and determined that a previous decision established the law of the case and that the provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 455.06(2) and 234.03(4) (statutes) were unconstitutional and void as contrary to the Fla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 2(a). The court held that although jurisdiction vested in the court by virtue of the trial court's ruling upon the constitutionality of the statutes, it was not necessary or appropriate to reach the constitutional issue presented because the trial court was correct in determining that the previous decision established the law of the case. The court therefore approved the order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Defendants challenged the finding that the statute extinguished any of their interests in the land and asserted the fee title to the land was not a valid root of title as to their remainder interests. The court concluded the deed constituted a valid root of title upon which a marketable record of title could be established. The court next concluded the conveyance was not defective and defendants' remainder interests were not saved from extinguishment by Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 712.03(1). Finally, the court found defendants' interests were not protected by any provision of the Florida Constitution because the property was not a homestead at the time the deed was executed.

The court answered the certified question in the negative, quashed the decision of the court of appeal, and remanded with directions. The court pointed out that while the legislature had authority under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 to require that jurors have qualifications of age, residence, and voter registration, and could statutorily disqualify others by reason of criminal activity, occupation, and infirmity, the seating of an unqualified or disqualified juror would not result in a reversal of a guilty verdict in the absence of a showing that such qualification deficiency affected the verdict or prevented a fair trial. The court held that in the absence of evidence that defendant was not accorded a fair and impartial jury or that his substantial rights were prejudiced by the participation and misconduct of the unqualified juror, he was not entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Criminal appellants were convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, they argued that the state's death penalty statute was unconstitutional, that the trial court erroneously failed to instruct the jury on a lesser-included offense, erred in giving certain instructions, failed to provide written instructions, and erroneously denied a change of venue. The state supreme court rejected all of these arguments. The court held that the validity of the death penalty statute had already been addressed and that the instructions as a whole were proper. In addition, the court held that the lack of written jury instructions was not a fundamental error, noting that no request for written instructions was made to the trial judge. The court further held that a change of venue need not have been granted, given that the jurors were found to be unswayed by the pretrial publicity. While appellants' convictions were affirmed, their death sentences were reduced to life imprisonment because the court could not ignore the recommendation of the jury.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review of the trial court's decision, alleging that ch. 316.210 bore no reasonable relation to any proper governmental purpose and was overbroad. Appellant alleged that the statute constituted a denial of due process and equal protection of the law as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 and 9.

When appellee failed to answer the complaint within twenty days after posting of the writ, default was entered, and a writ of execution was issued. Appellee's motions to stay execution and to set aside default were denied. Appellee's motion for rehearing was also denied. The appellate court reversed the trial court's decision and held that Fla. Stat. ch. 83.08, 83.09, and 83.11-.19 were unconstitutional. The highest state court affirmed, declaring that sections of Fla. Stat. ch. 83 were violative of due process rights because the right to a hearing after writ's issuance was not required. Fla. Stat. ch. 83.13 was constitutional on its face but not as applied in the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The highest state court affirmed the appellate court's decision holding that sections of the distress for rent statute were unconstitutional except where the statute merely created a lien. The cause was remanded to the trial court because service of process was required on appellee before proceedings culminating in judicial sale of appellee's property could be maintained.</SPAN></P>

One of the unsecured debts listed by appellant was appellee corporation's judgment debt that was ostensibly secured by property owned by appellant. The lower court found ch. 55.145 to be an unconstitutional deprivation of appellee's due process of law in that it purported to affect pre-existing liens and constituted ex post facto law. On review, the court found that appellee's judgment was enforceable only against a narrow range of pre-bankruptcy property. The court found that ch. 55.145 was not unconstitutional because it did not authorize the invalidation of liens that survived the bankruptcy, to the extent that there existed property subjected to the lien when the petition was filed.

Counsel attacked the validity of the first ungovernability adjudication and claimed that the dependency statute was invalid. The trial court granted appellee's motion to dismiss and found that the statute was unconstitutional because it was vague and failed to include right to counsel provisions. Appellant sought review. The reviewing court reversed and remanded and held that while a child was entitled to counsel as a matter of federal constitutional law, the statute was not invalid simply because it omitted right to counsel provisions. Appellee was properly adjudicated a dependent because the hearing was not a critical step in a delinquency determination.

Stat. ch. 543.041(2)(b). Appellee moved to dismiss the information and alleged that the statute was invalid and unconstitutional as violative of the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Const. in that it directly conflicted with the federal copyright laws. The trial court held that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite in that it did not make clear whether all of its elements had to be proven to sustain a conviction. The trial court also held that the statute was unconstitutional and void as ex post facto legislation. Appellant challenged the trial court's decision. The supreme court reversed. The supreme court found that the statute in question did not conflict with the federal Copyright Clause. The supreme court concluded that Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the Circuit Court, Second Judicial District (Florida), decision that granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and found that Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment to plaintiff county judges and remanded with instructions to dismiss their complaint that Fla. Stat. ch. 34.024 (1975) and 1975 Fla. Laws ch. 75-280, &sect;18 unfairly discriminated against judges in smaller counties by giving them smaller salaries than judges in larger counties. Plaintiffs argued that the state statutes violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 and art. V and U.S. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 10, 11(a)(1), and 11(b). The legislature had wide discretion in choosing a classification, and population was previously found to be a relevant basis for classification. Courts had taken judicial notice of differences in crime and divorce rates between greater and less densely populated areas. Therefore, there was a reasonable basis for the classification. There was no denial of equal protection where a court system was based upon size classifications, as long as all people within the classified area were treated equally. Plaintiffs did not meet their burden of showing that the claimed discrimination did not have a basis in the greater responsibilities of judges in counties with larger populations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employee's negligence suit against defendants, subcontractor and insurer, was barred because defendants were entitled to statutory immunity. Plaintiff was injured while working on a construction job. Plaintiff brought suit against defendants for his injuries. Prior to the filing of suit, an amendment to Fla.

The court reversed and remanded, holding that because the legislature did not express a clear intention that the amendment was retroactive, it was only prospectively applicable. Because the parties contractually agreed to the statutory provision as of the time of the injury, defendants' statutory immunity rights vested before the amendment's passage. Thus, defendants were immune from the suit.</SPAN></P>

Because a statutory amendment abrogating defendants' statutory immunity was not retroactively applicable, defendants were immune from suit.

Appellant wished to spend campaign treasury funds prior to filing his qualification papers, including funds for media advertising and printing, but was prohibited from doing so by Fla. Stat. ch. 106.15(1). Appellant filed a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief seeking to have the section of the statute that proscribed such activities declared unconstitutional. The trial court denied appellant's motion. The appellate court affirmed and held that the statute was constitutional as a reasonable restriction on U.S. Const. amend. I free speech rights. The reviewing court reversed the appellate court's decision and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional because it denied candidates their fundamental right to speak on political issues and to advocate their candidacy by making use of advertising in various media until they were within the described political season. The court ruled that the fact that they could spend unlimited amounts for such purposes in the designated time period did not cure the infirmity or make the restraints any more acceptable.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also enjoined appellant, the state department of revenue, from levying income tax on the gains at issue, and the trial court allowed appellees to deduct or exclude gains from their income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the property as of the amendment date for the purpose of restoring that amount to appellee free of any state tax. The supreme court reversed the trial court's decision.

The effect of the litigation was to test the constitutionality of a qualification for public office provided by Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 105.031(4)(a), and to contest an election for judicial office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The incumbent was ousted from judicial office in a close election.

The election winner filed a petition for a writ of quo warranto to oust the holdover incumbent from office and the incumbent filed a petition for a writ of prohibition to prevent action on the writ of quo warranto. The election winner also filed an original petition for writ of quo warranto in the current court to oust the holdover incumbent from office. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that Fla. Stat.

The requirement was more restrictive than the qualifications imposed by Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 8 and it applied only to candidates for judicial offices and it served no legitimate state interest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for involuntary sexual battery of a child under the age of eleven, but reversed the imposed sentence of death. Defendant argued that the child's out-of-court declaration was inadmissible because it violated his right to confrontation and cross-examination and constituted an improper exception to the hearsay rule. The court held that there was sufficient physical evidence from which a jury could find that it was defendant who committed the offense, however, the child's statement could be admitted for the purpose of refuting any inference questioning the identity of the assailant. The court held that the child's statement was properly allowed into evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule. Although defendant's act was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel under Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141, nothing was shown to distinguish this crime from any other violation of the same statute. The court held that to affirm the death penalty in this instance would mean the unconstitutional imposition of the death penalty for all individuals convicted of this crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgment declaring Fla. Laws 75-22, &sect; 17 unconstitutional, alleging that the statutory provisions for a type one transfer of plaintiff's functions to another department for review of plaintiff's exercise of executive powers in the area of budgeting were free of constitutional defect. The circuit court held that the constitutional provision allowing plaintiff's exercise of certain of its executive powers as provided by law did not mean that the legislature could, by making the exercise of these powers subject to the approval of the other department, deprive plaintiff of its authority. Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20.06(1) authorized transferee department to review the exercise of the powers, duties, and functions of transferred agency. It was clear that, absent qualification, a type one transfer placed the transferred agency under the absolute control of the department head. Such an arrangement in the instant case was constitutionally impermissible. While the legislature could pass laws affecting plaintiff's exercise of its executive budgetary authority, it could not pass laws depriving plaintiff of such authority. As such, the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected appellant's arguments and held that, because ch. 394.467 had specific criteria that had to be met, it was not vague or overbroad. The court also held that the standard of proof was clear and convincing and that the state had not met that burden by showing that appellant was a danger to himself or others.

The lessors attacked the statute insofar as it operated retroactively, both as being without the ambit of the statute and as an impairment of the obligation of contract in violation of the United States and Florida Constitutions. All of the parties agreed that the suits involved only the application of Fla. Stat.

The court held that the statute did not apply retroactively and that it was unconstitutional as impairing the obligation of contract under U.S. Const. and Fla. Const. art I, &sect; 10.

Furthermore, the court held that the enforcement agents had the power to obtain and execute a search warrant in appellant's case. Finally, the court held that separate powers of the executive and legislative branches were not blurred. Therefore, because Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state agencies sought review of a summary judgment granted by the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit of Florida in and for Leon County in favor of appellee private owner, in appellee corporation's action for declaratory, injunctive, and other relief under its claims to ownership of lakes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee corporation filed a suit that asserted ownership of certain lakes. Appellant state agencies countered that the lakes were navigable bodies of water held as sovereignty lands in trust for the public. It was undisputed that government surveys were conducted and that the official surveys did not meander any of the lakes involved. The trial court concluded that non-meandered lakes and ponds were not to be classified as navigable bodies of water, and granted summary judgment in favor of appellee. On appeal, the court noted that any change in the standard for determining what was or was not navigable water and sovereign land was committed to the legislature and not to the courts. Appellants contended that the trial court made a distinction between meandered and non-meandered lakes without a factual basis. The court upheld the trial court's reliance on surveys that were many decades old without second-guessing the surveyors. Additionally, the court thought that both legal and equitable estoppel barred appellants' claims because state agents conveyed property rights and acquiesced in the development of the land surrounding the inland chain of lakes at issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lower court invalidated a $ 50 million bond issue that had been approved by the voters of appellant county. The bond was intended to provide for the maintenance of beaches and parks. The lower court found the purpose of the bond issue to be unconstitutional under Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 12 and found that appellant failed to comply with notice requirements under Fla. Stat. ch. 100.211. On appeal, the court reversed the lower court's judgment. The court found that the language of the bond issue could be construed in a manner that did not violate the Florida Constitution. The court also found that while appellant did not comply with certain requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 100.211, it substantially complied with the notice requirement when ballots were sent to voters. Further, the legislature declared the notice adequate in Fla. Stat. ch. 75-471. The court remanded for further proceedings consistent with its decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant motorist who was charged with speeding in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.181 challenged the unconstitutionality of the statute, contending it subjected him to a greater penalty when he exercised his right to confront witnesses against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, who was charged with unlawful speed in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.181, challenged the constitutionality of the statute on the grounds that it subjected him to a greater penalty when he exercised his right to confront witnesses against him. Appellant argued that the statute unconstitutionally gave him the choice of paying a $ 25 fine or requesting a hearing at which he could be subjected to a penalty of up to $ 500. Appellant therefore argued that the statute subjected him to a greater penalty when he exercised his right to confront witnesses against him. The supreme court rejected appellant's argument, holding that the statute provided for a type of plea bargaining, a principle not only upheld but also encouraged by the courts. The supreme court concluded that allowing the trial judge to impose a greater sentence after trial than was agreed upon in a plea bargaining agreement if appellant would plead guilty did not penalize appellant for his election to exercise his constitutional right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The supreme court concluded that the statute at issue was constitutional and did not violate due process guarantees or equal protection of the law. The supreme court held that appellee state's offer to appellant motorist to pay a speeding fine was no more than an offer in settlement of his case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff state sought review of an order from the trial court (Florida), granting defendant's motion to dismiss an information charging defendant with resisting arrest with violence, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 843.01 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's arrest for selling newspapers on a street corner was unlawful because the arrest was based on a breach of peace statute that unconstitutionally limited free speech. Defendant was a newspaper street vendor. An off-duty police officer arrested defendant, claiming defendant was harassing people. An information was brought that charged defendant with resisting arrest with violence, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 843.01 (1975). Defendant brought a motion to dismiss, claiming the arrest was unlawful because it was based upon an unconstitutional breach of peace statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 877.03 (1975). The trial court granted the motion. Plaintiff prosecution appealed. The court affirmed, holding that because the statute was overbroad it unconstitutionally violated defendant's free speech rights. The court held that more than a mere annoyance was necessary to find a violation under the statute. The court limited the application of the statute to proscribe that conduct consisting of &quot;fighting words&quot; or language reporting a false, physical hazard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of defendant newspaper vendor's motion to dismiss an information charging him with resisting arrest with violence. Where defendant was confronting people on the street, this was insufficient to find he violated a breach of peace statute. The statute was held unconstitutionally overbroad. The statute could only regulate &quot;fighting words&quot; or speech reporting a false, physical hazard.</SPAN></P>
