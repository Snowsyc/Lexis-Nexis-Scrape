</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with loitering for the purpose of engaging or soliciting another person to engage in deviate sexual intercourse under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-9-113(2)(c) (1971). The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss, holding that the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. The statute failed to require the loitering to be coupled with any other overt conduct. Rather, the loitering needed only to be coupled with the state of mind of having the purpose of engaging or soliciting another person to engage in deviate sexual intercourse. The trial court refused to interpret the statute so that it prohibited loitering only when the loitering was coupled with the overt act of solicitation because it would have rendered the statute inconsistent with other sections of the criminal code. It was no longer a crime of any sort, much less a felony, to engage in consensual deviate sexual intercourse, and solicitation for deviate sexual intercourse was no longer prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of attempted robbery and having a firearm on his person in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. 40-11-10 (1965 Perm. Supp.). Upon appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that attempted robbery without aggravation clearly did not include any element not included in the attempted robbery with aggravation. Therefore, the lesser included offense test was met. All the facts and evidence regarding the actions and statements of defendant just prior to his act of attempted robbery justified a strong inference on the part of the jury that defendant had the weapon concealed on his person just prior to the attempted robbery. The evidence, which included all reasonable inferences, which may be drawn therefrom, was be viewed in the light which most favors the jury's verdict. The court therefore rejected defendant's argument that the evidence was insufficient in this respect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-5-2 (1963). He was sentenced to two to five years of imprisonment and hard labor. The sentencing court denied his motion to reduce his sentence and the court affirmed its decision. Defendant failed to meet his burden of establishing that &sect; 48-5-2 unconstitutionally imposed a cruel and unusual punishment. His sentence failed to shock the court's conscience in light of his previous deferred prosecution for a drug-related offense and the amount of marijuana he had possessed. The court found that the sentencing court properly considered defendant's criminal history, as sentencing courts were expected to tailor sentences to the defendant under Colo. R. Crim. P. 32. Although defendant claimed he was told that his deferred prosecution would not be considered at sentencing, the court found that there was no misunderstanding revolving the facts surrounding that matter. Although defendant claimed that the sentencing court improperly considered evidence suggesting that he had intended to sell marijuana to others, the court found that this was a valid aggravating factor under Colo. R. Crim. P. 32.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was engaged in a bookmaking operation, employed two people to help him. Defendant did not deduct or withhold taxes from the cash wages paid to the employees. Defendant sought to raise an inference that he was not the employer but that they were the employees of a syndicate which allegedly controlled the gambling operations. The trial court convicted defendant of failing to collect and pay over withholding taxes, and the court affirmed. The court found that the jury could reasonably believe from all the evidence that defendant was the employer and was obligated by law to withhold income taxes from the wages of his employees. The jury obviously disbelieved the theory the a syndicate was the actual employer. The court also held that the withholding tax statute was not an unconstitutional invasion of defendant's privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. The requirement that he withhold taxes from the wages of his employees did not expose his gambling activities and subject him to criminal penalties. The possibility of incrimination was insufficient to defeat the strong policies in favor of withholding the taxes.</SPAN></P>

His license ultimately was revoked for six months by the Department and the trial court and court both affirmed its decision. The court found that the licensee was notified of his rights under &sect; 13-5-30(3) by both oral warning and by an advisement form. Although the licensee asserted that the hearing was merely a formality, the court found that this was not so since reasonable grounds needed to be established at the hearing that the licensee was driving under the influence of alcohol and the hearing provided an opportunity to determine whether the licensee was asked to take a sobriety test. Further, the court rejected the licensee's claim that &sect; 13-5-30(3) unconstitutionally placed the burden of proof upon him. An order to show cause was a method of serving process and not an assignment of the burden of proof.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The department of revenue ordered the revocation of the driver's license pursuant to the implied consent law, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-5-30(3) (1971 Perm. Supp.). The lower court affirmed the order. Upon appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that because there was no prosecutor, the hearing examiner undoubtedly asked more questions of the witnesses than he would have had a prosecutor been present. The court found that defendant was represented by an attorney at the department of revenue hearing and therefore, there was not as great a need for the examiner to bring out defendant's side of the case as it would be if defendant were unrepresented. From an examination of this record, the court detected no basis for saying that the hearing examiner was not objective, or that the hearing was conducted in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 3-16-4(6) (1969 Perm. Supp.). The court held that defendant's erratic driving behavior constituted sufficient probable cause to stop his car.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The pharmacy commenced an action in the district court for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, praying that the district court declare unconstitutional and restrain the enforcement of Rules 5 and 6 of &sect; 48-1-2(d).1 of the board's rules and regulations. The board interpreted the rules to prohibit advertising of prices of prescription drugs and medicines. The trial court entered a temporary restraining order and denied the board's motion to dismiss and dissolve the restraining order. The court then granted the pharmacy's motion for a preliminary injunction, whereupon the original proceeding was commenced by the pharmacy. The court entered an order to show cause why the preliminary injunction should not become permanent. The court then denied the permanent injunction and held that the pharmacy had not in the past been advertising its prescription drug and medicine prices and that its intention to do so was prospective only. Thus, the court held that because there was no judicial declaration of invalidity, the judicial restraint by injunction imposed upon the board's proper function of enforcing its rules and regulations was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The voters were registered electors who did not vote at a general election. Under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 49-4-21 (1963), their names were purged from the registration books. The voters brought an action for a judgment declaring that the statute was unconstitutional because it augmented the qualifications of electors as defined in Colo. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1. The trial court declared that the statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the statute imposed merely an administrative process designed to facilitate, rather than complicate, participation in the election process. The court rejected the voters' argument that the purging procedure resulted in invidious discrimination between qualified registered electors who exercised their right to vote in general elections and qualified registered electors who did not vote. The court held that the so-called impediment of re-registering was minimal. The court found that no one was barred from voting. The court rejected the voters' challenge to the statute on due process grounds because it required that notice be sent to those whose names were purged from the registration books.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found the provisions of the Urban Renewal Law, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-62-1 et seq. (1963) and the Relocation Assistance and Land Acquisition Policies Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. 69-10-1 et seq. (1971 Perm. Supp.) constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners argued that by denying compensation for the loss of goodwill or profit associated with the dislocation of their businesses, the statutes deprived them of property without due process of law and without just compensation and discriminated against them as a class in violation of the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that the purpose of the Urban Renewal Law was to have provided supplemental assistance for particular losses incurred by reason of dislocation in an effort to reduce the burden that fell on the property owner whose property was condemned. The court determined that the omission of supplemental payments for the loss of goodwill and profit in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-62-5(11) did not render the statute unconstitutional. The court further held that it was not shown that the statutes interfered with, limited, or restricted any rights guaranteed by the constitution. Finally, the court determined that the classifications and the treatment afforded the classes under the statutes met the rational basis tests and were not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendants were convicted of offenses involving the possession or sale of marijuana, they appealed. Defendants claimed that the continued classification of marijuana as a narcotic rather than a dangerous or hallucinogenic drug was an unreasonable legislative classification, the consequences of which denied them the equal protection of the laws. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the classification of the drug as a narcotic was strictly for the legislature, and therefore the court was required to exercise judicial restraint in refusing to strike the present controls from the statutes. The court stated that there was a presumption in favor of the constitutionality of a statute and that defendants bore the burden of proving its unconstitutionality. The court found that the classification furthered a legitimate governmental purpose and that there was a rational basis for the classification and control of marijuana as a narcotic. The court noted that the ability and integrity of the legislative process required the court to defer to the legislative body as the proper forum for the resolution of the controversy.</SPAN></P>

P. 57(b) and 65, seeking to declare an ordinance regulating pawnbrokering unconstitutional before it became operative. After a hearing, the trial court held that the city could exercise its police power and require licenses of pawnbrokers; however, it found the city's ordinance to be unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, holding that the state legislature's comprehensive scheme for the regulation of pawnbrokers, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-58-1 et seq. (1963), evinced an intent that such regulation be administered through its cities and towns but those cities and towns could only pass further regulation that did not conflict. Because there was a basic conflict between the ordinance and the statute in the requirement of bonds, the maximum rate of interest, and the prohibition against firearms, the court affirmed in part. Noting the severability clause contained in the ordinance, however, the court reversed the trial court's order declaring the entire ordinance unconstitutional, concluding that those provisions that did not conflict with the statute were valid.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found in favor of appellee ,and the appellate court consolidated appellants' cases. Appellants contended that section 13-4-23(1)(a) was unconstitutional. The court found that appellants had not demonstrated that the statute was unconstitutional or that it was applied in an unconstitutional manner. The statute did not constitute an unreasonable exercise of police power because the right to use the highways was not absolute. Therefore, because appellants were unable to show that section 13-4-23(1)(a) was unconstitutional and because appellee followed all administrative procedures, the court upheld the trial court's decision that appellants' licenses were properly revoked.</SPAN></P>

It asserted that the trial court misinterpreted Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138-1-37 (Supp. 1965) and that defendants applied an unconstitutional standard to determine if a corporation was doing business in the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer included in its state income tax returns for 1963-1966 only the income allocable to Colorado. Defendants assessed income tax for all of the taxpayer's income for those years. The taxpayer paid the deficiencies and brought an action to recover the payment. The trial court dismissed the complaint and the taxpayer appealed, asserting that the trial court misconstrued Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138-7-37 (Supp. 1965) and that the criteria that the revenue department used to determine when a corporation was doing business in the state was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. It held that 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 381 could be used in a correlative manner in applying the state regulation and it found no basis for unconstitutionality. The federal statute fixed minimum standards of business activity for a foreign corporation under which the state could not tax any portion of the corporation's income and the director used it as a guideline. The taxpayer did not meet that standard. Its out-of-state business did not extend beyond solicitation of orders. The court further held that the taxpayer's past allocation of income was not dispositive because the director could change methods of allocation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother brought the action on her own behalf and as next friend of her children who were students in the district. They sought the recovery of fees required by the district to be paid by students for non-academic activities, a declaratory judgment that the collection of such fees was violative of Colo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, an injunction, and an order permitting them to maintain the suit as a class action. The trial court awarded plaintiffs a sum of money, ruled that they would not be permitted to maintain the suit as a class action, and denied injunctive relief. Defendants appealed, and the court dismissed the appeal. The court held that defendants' appeal was directed to matters not ruled upon by the trial court. Defendants' argument on appeal was that the fees did not deprive a student of the benefits of a free public school and gratuitous education as required by the Colorado Constitution. However, the trial court specifically stated that it was not ruling that it was constitutionally impermissible to charge fees for the non-academic activities. The trial court only ruled that the mother could not be required to pay certain fees and expenditures by reason of her indigency.</SPAN></P>

The court found the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. Defendants argued that the did not voluntarily waive a jury trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the District was created, the subject land was excluded therefrom pursuant to Colo. Rev.

When the company bought the land and built a manufacturing plant on it, the District's Board of Directors vacated the exemption pursuant to &sect; 89-12-8(2), and ordered that the land be included in the District and taxed. The company filed suit to have the land excluded. The trial court found that &sect; 89-12-8(1) was unconstitutional in that it arbitrarily excluded manufacturing plants that were in the District at the time of its creation, while imposing taxes on land that was converted to manufacturing uses after the District's creation. The trial court ordered that the land be excluded. The court reversed, holding that the scheme set forth in &sect; 89-12-8 did not violate the Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses of the Colorado Constitution. The court noted that the basis for different treatment of the two classes of manufacturers was to provide for the increased costs attributable to the proliferation of manufacturing plants and the attendant impact of employees using the District's facilities.

Her appearance also controlled the jurisdictional challenge. The court concluded that the failure to effect service on defendant's mother did not constitute reversible error. Additionally, the record revealed that there was ample evidence presented at the transfer hearing to support the judge's findings under Colo. R. Juv. P. 25.

The trial court found there was no logical distinction between first and second degree murder. The State appealed, and the court reversed and remanded.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 82-4-8(4)(g) (Perm. Supp. 1969), of the Colorado Employment Security Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A steel worker voluntarily quit his part-time employment to accept a better job with another company, where he was to receive the same pay but would work more hours per week. After approximately two and a half weeks, he quit that job in order to accept another job which he felt would be of longer duration. Soon afterward, the steel worker found himself out of work for three weeks due to a strike. For this period, he applied for unemployment but, based upon the &quot;better-job&quot; provisions of the Colorado Employment Security Act, the hearing officer held that he was disqualified. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 82-4-8 (6)(b)(vii) (Perm. Supp. 1969) provided that a worker who voluntarily quit a job to accept a better job would be eligible for benefits in the event of subsequent unemployment if the job last at least 90 days. The decision was affirmed by the Commission. Affirming the decision, the court concluded that the &quot;better-job&quot; provision was properly applied to disqualify the steel worker from an award of unemployment compensation, and that as so construed, it did not violate the constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed on appeal, inter alia, that assault with a deadly weapon was a lesser included offense of forcible rape and, therefore, that the jury could not consistently find him not guilty of the assault and guilty of forcible rape. The court affirmed, holding (1) assault with a deadly weapon was not a lesser included offense of forcible rape because use of a deadly weapon was a necessary element of the former, but not of the latter, and, therefore, the jury could properly find defendant not guilty of assault and guilty of forcible rape, (2) the evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury's verdict on the rape charge, (3) defendant suffered no prejudice as a result of the trial court combining in one jury instruction the instructions on the presumption of innocence, the burden of proof, and reasonable doubt, and the trial court otherwise made no jury instruction errors, (4) the trial court did not err in imposing consecutive sentences because the charged crimes, though arising from the same criminal episode, were separate and distinct, and (5) Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested and convicted for wearing a pair of blue jeans on the seat of which a portion of the American flag had been sewn. On appeal, he challenged the validity of &sect; 40-23-3(1) on the grounds that it constituted an invasion of his right of free expression, that it was overbroad, and that it was vague and indefinite. The court found that defendant's actions were committed with the specific intent to cast contempt upon the flag and that his conduct manifested an expressive intent and a communicative content. The court held that defendant's conduct was symbolic speech and, consequently, was protected speech under the First Amendment, and that the challenged portion of the statute was unconstitutional on its face because it limited the expression of ideas about the flag to patriotic expressions acceptable to those charged with the enforcement of the criminal law and attempted to impress a symbolic orthodoxy upon the people of Colorado. The court further held that because of the preferred position of freedom of speech in the United States Constitution, the State's interests were insufficient to uphold the validity of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner juvenile appealed an order of the Juvenile Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) affirming The Board of Education's affirming of the superintendent's order to expel petitioner from the Denver public school system because of a series of assaults on his fellow students. Petitioner argued that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 123-20-7(1)(d) (1963), part of the School Attendance Law of 1963, was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner also contended that even if the law was constitutional, his due process rights were violated and the school expulsion was unlawful. The court disagreed and affirmed. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 123-20-7(1)(d) (1963) provided that behavior which was hostile to the welfare, safety, or morals of other students was grounds for suspension or expulsion. The court balanced the individual's loss of an interest in an education with the clearness of the challenged statutory language and found that the statute was constitutional on its face. The statute was directed at conduct towards a narrow class, other pupils, and the prohibited conduct was strictly limited. Petitioner was not denied the right to compulsory process when the school officials did not produce school records, which the trial court found did not exist. He did not timely request that certain witnesses appear when he only notified them the morning of the hearing. Petitioner failed to object to the lack of an oath being administered to the witnesses and agreed that the hearing transcript would be the majority of the submitted evidence, thus he waived his right to later raise the issues on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction in the District Court of Mesa County (Colorado) for theft. Defendant alleged error of the trial court in permitting the prosecution to elicit on cross-examination of defendant under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 154-1-1 that he had two prior felony convictions, both of which occurred more than five years prior to trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of theft. The court affirmed the trial court. Defendant challenged Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 154-1-1 (1963) on two grounds. He contended that the act was unconstitutional in that the classification of witnesses by the type of action in which they testify constituted a denial of equal protection of the law. He argued for an interpretation that would leave the matter of the admissibility of the prior conviction to the discretion of the trial court. The court held that it was certainly not unreasonable for the legislature to permit a more searching inquiry into the credibility of witnesses in a criminal trial where the burden was on the state to prove the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that a previous felony conviction of a witness, whatever its age, could be shown to affect credibility. In the present state of the law the effect on credibility of a &quot;remote&quot; conviction was left to the judgment of the jury.</SPAN></P>

The property owner sought review, contending that the trial court erred in limiting its consideration to a review of the record of the council proceedings wherein the special assessment was determined and the ordinance was adopted. On review, the court held that it was appropriate that review be had under Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(a)(4), which was specifically authorized where there was no available plain, speedy or adequate remedy. The court also determined that the burden of proof was upon the objectors to the assessments to affirmatively show that the result of the apportionment was not according to the benefits. Because the property owner offered no evidence to the council as to increases or decreases in the land value of its property by reason of the special improvements the court held that he had failed to meet that burden.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city adopted an ordinance providing for the licensing and regulation of pawnbrokers. Appellee pawnbroker filed a declaratory judgment action under Colo. R. Civ. P. 57, challenging the constitutionality of certain provisions of the ordinance.

The city appealed. The court learned for the first time during the oral arguments of counsel that the attorney general had not been served with a copy of the proceedings, as required by Colo. R. Civ.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff telephone company sought review of a judgment of the District Court, Second Judicial Circuit (Colorado), which affirmed the rates authorized by defendant Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC). The trial court also dismissed the telephone company's claims in mandamus and for declaratory relief based on the limited nature of judicial review of decisions by the PUC.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The telephone company filed a revised schedule of rates with the PUC and subsequently supplemented its filing with a request for a larger rate increase that would result in a 13 percent return on common equity. The PUC authorized a rate increase sufficient to earn an 11.4 percent return on common equity. The telephone company sought review of the PUC decision in the trial court and included claims for mandamus and declaratory relief. The trial court dismissed the additional claims, concluding that judicial review was limited under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115-6-15 (Supp. 1969), and affirmed the PUC's rate decision. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the use of the most recent test year available was a reliable guideline in fixing the rate to be charged for telephone service and that the PUC's decision was supported by adequate evidence. The court noted that rate fixing by the PUC involved more than the finding and application of facts; it involved questions of judgment or discretion by the PUC. There was no basis to indicate that the PUC abused its discretion or that its judgment was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

The claimant was injured while sorting potatoes for respondent employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant maintained that he was not engaged in farm labor at the time of the accident, and therefore, he was entitled to workmen's compensation benefits. His argument was that, once the potatoes had been removed from the ground, their disposition, while perhaps involving agricultural labor, did not come under the category of farm labor. The argument continued that firms that were not engaged in the farming business could and did sort potatoes. In affirming, the court was unable to accept the claimant's argument. The court noted that the employer was engaged in farming and his objective, so far as potatoes were concerned, was to sell them. Before sale, the potatoes had to be sorted. The sorting of the potatoes was an incident to the employer's farming operation. Accordingly, the Commission was correct in concluding that the claimant was engaged in farm and ranch labor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his convictions in the District Court of Jefferson County (Colorado), for escape and kidnapping. Defendant argued that Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was incarcerated when he and a fellow prisoner were transported by a guard to and from a play they were participating in. The group stopped at a drug store when one of the prisoners claimed he had a headache, and defendant purchased a ruler and other supplies. After the play, the prisoners gave the guard the wrong directions so they ended up on a dead end street, and the prisoners pulled a cord around the guard's neck, bound him, and escaped. Defendant was caught as he was about to depart on a charter flight. Defendant was convicted of escape and kidnapping, and he appealed. The court affirmed, holding that defendant's challenges to the validity of the conviction were without merit. The kidnapping statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave sufficiently definite warning of the forbidden conduct so that men of common intelligence could readily apprehend its meaning and application. The offense of assault was not a necessary element of the charge of kidnapping, so the trial court did not err in refusing defendant's tendered instruction on assault. Defendant was not prejudiced when the jury saw him in shackles or by the presence of police in the courtroom.</SPAN></P>

The statutory formula as applied to the company in the years in question did not bear an unreasonable relationship to that portion of its income actually derived from sources within the state, and was free from constitutional infirmities. The findings were adequately supported by the record. The court held that the state two-factor formula consisting of sales and property factors was not intrinsically arbitrary where the constitution does not require that any specific apportionment formula be used in taxing the income of a multistate business. No multiple tax burdens on the part of the company were shown to exist. In this type of case the company had to show that the formula placed a burden on interstate commerce in a constitutional sense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue before the court was whether the trial court was correct in declaring the three-year durational residency charter requirement, as set forth in Aspen.

On appeal, the court held that the trial court's judgment invalidating as unconstitutional the three-year durational residency requirement was correct. The compelling governmental interest test required that the reason for making a decision for the voters as to who should be qualified to run for public office had to be real, clear, and compelling. The three-year residency requirement involved in the case could not be found to be reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of a legitimate municipal objective and, therefore, it did not pass constitutional muster.

The city contended that &sect; 18-16-3 was unconstitutional and that the village had not complied with the requisites of the &sect; 18-16-3. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 18-16-3 was not unconstitutionally vague and did not confer arbitrary and unlimited power on the trial court because it provided a specific statutory procedure for the exclusion of territory from a special service district, set forth the conditions which had to be met, and delineated what a trial court had to find in order to obtain exclusion. Further, the village was properly excluded from the city because the village proved that it was providing essentially the same services as those provided by the city and thus, met the requirements of &sect; 18-16-3. Finally, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-21-16(1) (1965) was a proper exercise of legislative authority to establish the status of disputed annexed territory pending judicial review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The airport authority was created by the city and county and issued bonds in order to raise revenue. The taxpayers and association challenged the issuance of the bonds as well as the joint action by the city and county that created the airport authority. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss and the trial court granted the motion. The taxpayers and association challenged the decision and the court affirmed. The city's action in proposing and enacting authorizing legislation was not invalid as it complied with the emergency provisions in the Grand Junction, Colo., City Charter. The recitation in the ordinance that an emergency situation existed that required proposal and passage of the legislation on the same date was conclusive as to existence of the emergency. Thus, strict compliance with the city charter was accomplished. Additionally, the creation of the joint airport authority did not constitute an unconstitutional taking of property where no private property was taken. The municipalities existed for the public convenience had no privileges or immunities under the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-5-30(1)(a) (1963 &amp; Perm. Supp. 1969).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that &sect; 13-5-30(1)(a) was so vague that, in the absence of chemical tests to establish intoxication, there were no reasonable ascertainable standards by which guilt could be determined and that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that DUI was established by intoxication to the &quot;slightest degree.&quot; The court found that &sect; 13-5-30(1)(a) provided standards sufficiently precise to inform defendant of the crime charged. Juries of common experience could determine whether one was substantially under the influence so as to be incapable of operating a vehicle safely, as distinguished from merely driving while ability was impaired. The &quot;slightest degree&quot; definition applied to the offense of driving while ability was impaired (DWAI) under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-5-30(1)(b). For the greater offense of DUI in &sect; 13-5-30(1)(a) the test was substantially under the influence. Defendant's conviction was reversed because the trial court failed to properly instruct the jury. The instruction defined &quot;under the influence&quot; as encompassing an area of intoxication covered not only by DUI, but also by DWAI.</SPAN></P>

Because of the constitutional challenge, the appeal was transferred from the Court of Appeals to the court pursuant to Colo. App. R. 50.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The worker challenged the constitutionality of a portion of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 82-4-8(4)(g) (1963). Such provision of the Colorado Employment Security Act dealt with the quitting of a job to accept a &quot;better job&quot; which did not last, and when benefits could, or could not be awarded, under such a situation. On appeal, the court held that the declared purpose of the Colorado Employment Security Act was to benefit persons unemployed through no fault of their own. This purpose was subverted by the challenged provision because it made an invidious distinction between (1) those who obtained a better job which terminated prior to 90 days because of lack of work with no fault of their own and (2) those who obtained a better job which terminated prior to 90 days because of some other factor other than lack of work with no fault of their own. In other words, the challenged provision denied compensation without valid reason to a narrow category of workers which included the worker. The statutory provision here involved was a clear example of a violation of the equal protection provision of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order of the Industrial Commission denying the worker unemployment compensation, and the cause was remanded to the Industrial Commission for a new hearing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that reversal was required because the prosecutor's cross-examination of two of defendant's five alibi witnesses regarding felony convictions was improper since the witnesses were recalled after the defense rested.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant also argued that a new trial should have been granted because one juror was incompetent to serve under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 78-1-1 (1963) because he had been convicted of a felony. On appeal, the court disagreed. Defendant objected to the recall of the witnesses for further cross-examination after the defense had rested. However, such matters pertaining to the order of proof were within the sound discretion of the trial judge and there was no evidence of abuse of that discretion. Further, good faith questioning as to felony convictions on cross-examination was permissible and there was nothing to suggest bad faith on the prosecutor's part in questioning either witness. Moreover, the trial court struck the questions posed to the second witness upon defendant's objection and advised the jury not to consider them. As such, the questioning did not require reversal. Finally, defendant waived his right to object to the juror's competency because defense counsel did not ask any voir dire questions relating to criminal records and delayed his request for a new trial until after the guilty verdict was rendered despite having had prior knowledge of the juror's felony record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal from the judgment of conviction, defendant submitted three points of alleged error. The first concerned the instruction on presumption of innocence. The second contention was that the statute under which defendant was convicted, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-5-2(3) (1967 Perm. Supp.) was unconstitutional. The third assignment of error concerned the admission into evidence of testimony elicited on cross-examination by the district attorney concerning defendant's parole violations. The court held that while it had disapproved of the challenged instruction in another case, that the giving of such instruction was not reversible error. Further, in case law precedent, &sect; 40-5-2(3) was found constitutional. Finally, the questions asked by the district attorney were not objected to and the answers were freely given. The trial court was not asked to strike the testimony from the record or to admonish the jury to disregard it. The court concluded that the lack of a contemporaneous objection at the time of the trial constituted a waiver and the issue was not assertable on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Supp.) making a child available for adoption solely for a parent's failure to provide reasonable support for a year or more was unconstitutional. The court reversed and ruled that the statute was not unconstitutional as denying substantive due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25. The court determined that a parent had no absolute right to his child under any and all circumstances, that the legislature had a wide discretion in determining when and under what circumstances a child could be adopted without the consent of its natural parents, and that the statute was a reasonable exercise of the legislature's authority to protect the interest and welfare of the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landowner sought to have the major portion of his land placed in a mobile home district with a small part zoned for commercial use. Defendant Board of County Commissioners of Adams County, Colorado, denied the rezoning request. After the landowner sought review of the Commissioners' decision in the District Court, Seventeenth Judicial District (Colorado), the district court ruled in favor of the Commissioners.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the landowner bought his property, a major part was in a mineral conservation district, a portion was in a flood control district, and a small part was zoned for industrial use. The court first held that under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 106-2-12(1) (Supp. 1967), the Commissioners were clearly statutorily authorized to establish flood control districts by resolution, and the grant of authority was sufficiently broad to authorize the establishment of a mineral conservation district such as the one established here. Next, the court held that although Adams County, Colo., Zoning Regs. ch. 8, relating to mineral conservation districts, limited the uses of land in such districts, sufficient uses were allowed so that the regulations did not amount to a taking of the property without due process. Finally, the regulations were not unconstitutional as applied to the property here. There was evidence that the property could be used for agricultural purposes and some commercial and residential purposes. Although there was testimony that the other uses would not be as profitable as mobile home use, the validity of zoning regulations was not determined by the highest and best use concept.</SPAN></P>

The county court granted the motion and the district court affirmed. On appeal the court affirmed and held the statute unconstitutional for overbreadth. The court found that if the suspension systems were susceptible to change and refinement each year, a flat prohibition against any alterations except heavy duty shock absorbers or springs made any improvements on older model cars criminal conduct. In effect, each of the many manufacturers were clothed with authority -- through engineering whim -- to set a standard for its product enforceable in Colorado, and thus would make conduct in Colorado subject to criminal sanctions if one disagreed with the design.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the zoning restrictions were an unreasonable exercise of police power, resulted in a substantial hardship to the developer, and denied the developer equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The village was zoned pursuant to a master plan as a green belt area of the lowest density residential development. The developer purchased the subject property in the center of the village with full knowledge of the R-1 zoning restrictions that permitted one dwelling per 2.5 acres. The developer proposed a planned unit development that would have increased the zoning density to approximately one site per 1.3 acres and doubled his profit from the land investment. The village planning commission refused to approve the developer's rezoning application. The trial court entered judgment in the developer's favor by declaring the R-1 restrictions unconstitutional as applied to the developer. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court found that there was no evidence of an unreasonable exercise of police power because the village was incorporated as a green belt with a rural atmosphere, and it was reasonably zoned to promote the statutorily authorized objectives. The court held that any hardship suffered by the developer was self-inflicted and that the developer was not denied equal protection merely because adjoining properties may have been put to more advantageous uses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the District Court of Gunnison County (Colorado), which convicted him in a joint trial with a codefendant of burglary in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-3-5(2)(a) (1963, Perm. Supp. 1967) and conspiracy to commit burglary in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-7-35 (1963).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The arresting officer testified that &quot;they&quot; had admitted being in the residence. On appeal, the court held as a threshold matter that the burglary statute required an unauthorized entry as well as the intent to commit a felony or misdemeanor, so that it was not unconstitutional on the theory that it punished thought alone. The court found that the general rule that acts or declarations made by one of the conspirators outside of the presence of other conspirators, after the consummation of the conspiracy, were inadmissible, did not apply when the conspirators apparently were together when the statements were made. The court further held that defendant was not prejudiced when each defendant's statement was identical, voluntary, and clearly admissible against that defendant. The court also ruled that testimony that items in house had been moved after entry was relevant evidence from which the jury could infer that the necessary intent existed at the time of entry. The court also found that the trial court had wide discretion to decide whether to grant a continuance. Finally, the court held that defendant did not show any prejudice from alleged misconduct on the part of a juror.</SPAN></P>

He was then charged with writing a bad check, based on the same occurrence, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-14-10 (Supp. 1965) (old statute). Section 40-14-10 had been replaced by the new statute. Petitioner claimed that because the old statute was repealed, by the enactment of the new statute, he could not have been charged under the old statute. The court held that because the newer statute was declared unconstitutional, the old statute was not repealed. To hold that the legislature intended to repeal the old statute to be effective even if the new statute were declared unconstitutional, the court would have to had presumed that the legislature intended to create a void in the law relating to bad checks. Such a presumption was without merit, particularly because the State had had some law in the &quot;bad check&quot; area since at least 1885. No authorities supported petitioner's contention that trial under the old statute constituted double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad and reached conduct that under the police power could not have been reasonably classified as unlawful such as gun store owners and pawnshop owners carrying guns to and from their businesses. The court held that such conduct could not have been the subject of criminal sanctions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action for a declaratory judgment as to the unconstitutionality of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 124-18-3(3) (Supp. 1967), appellant student challenged a judgment from the District Court of Boulder County (Colorado) granting respondent tuition committee members judgment on the pleadings. He asserted that &sect; 124-18-3(3) established an impermissible conclusive presumption as to his residency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the student had attended a university as an out-of-state student, he requested a reclassification as an in-state student based on his one-year domicile in the state. The members denied the change because &sect; 124-18-3(3) barred a change in residency status unless a student had been a domiciliary for one year while not in school, or while his school attendance was limited to eight hours per term. The student sought a declaratory judgment that &sect; 124-18-2(3) was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the members judgment on the pleadings, and the student appealed, insisting that &sect; 124-18-3(3) created an impermissible conclusive presumption. The court agreed, explaining that a conclusive presumption could not be used to classify a person as a non-resident when he was in fact a resident. The disputed portion of &sect; 124-18-3(3) provided this type of conclusive presumption. All full-time students, not residents of Colorado before they attended school there were prohibited from ever controverting the presumption of non-residency for tuition purposes while they remained full-time students. This imposed an invidious discrimination violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause with directions to reinstate the action and for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A state investigator took a broken upper denture to the owner's dental laboratory and requested that it be repaired. The person behind the counter accepted it, estimated the cost of repair, later returned it in a repaired condition, and collected the cost of repair. Following this, a summons and complaint for injunction was served upon the owner, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-1-32(2) (1963), alleging an unlicensed practice of dentistry. The court affirmed the injunctive order, holding that it was not necessary to prove whether the person behind the counter was the owner or an agent. The court rejected the owner's argument that he had been unconstitutionally deprived of vested rights by the statutory requirement that denture repair be performed only by prescription. Noting that a statute was to be presumed constitutional unless the contrary clearly appeared, the court held that such a regulation was a reasonable exercise of the police power and that it was related to the health and safety of the public.</SPAN></P>

The board denied the land owner a variance for the nonconforming use. The trial court reversed, but the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court overruled City and County of Denver v. Denver Buick, 141 Colorado 121, 347 P.2d 919, insofar as it required a specific charter authorization to the city council in order for it to promulgate terms and conditions for the termination of nonconforming uses. The court held that the board held the power over zoning, which included the power to deny variances for nonconforming uses. The court found that the denial of the variance was reasonable because no conditions existed in support of granting the variance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that the sole issue was whether appellees exceeded their delegated authority in issuing the regulation, which required that no optometrist conduct his practice in or on premises where a commercial or mercantile establishment was the primary business conducted. The court reasoned that the regulation of the practice of optometry by the general assembly was constitutionally permissible under the police power because it affected the public health, safety, and welfare. The court held that in carrying out this responsibility, the law enacted must have been reasonably related to the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The court further held that a regulation issued by an administrative body, must have been within the scope and objects of the statutory delegation of authority underlying the regulation. The court determined that it could find no reason why those conducting a commercial or mercantile business should have been singled out from the broad class of potential landlords from whom a licensed optometrist may have leased space in which to practice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The uninsured motorist was involved in an accident. The certified questions were whether, in a license revocation hearing under the Act, Colo. Rev.

The court affirmed the judgment, holding that because the Act gave sufficient guidance to the Commission on the standards to be employed in enforcing the Act, it did not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of power. The court then held that the Act was not unconstitutionally vague because it contained a notice requirement before either civil penalties or an injunction could enter, and provided for voluntary abatement such that any violator would have sufficient notice of the prohibited condition before becoming subject to enforcement efforts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A citizen was prevented from registering to vote in an election because he would not have been a resident of the state for three months prior to the election as required by the state constitution. The citizen sought an order to compel the county clerk and Secretary of State to permit him to register to vote in the election. The court held that the right to vote was at the core of the constitutional system and was a fundamental right of every citizen. There could be no discrimination between citizens with respect to that right, even as to a recent arrival, except for a compelling state interest that could not be reasonably protected in any other way. Therefore the court held that Colo. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1(a) and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 49-3-1(1)(c) (1971), insofar as they attempted to establish a three months durational residency as a condition of the right to vote, were unconstitutional under U.S. Const. art. XIV. The attorney general stated in his brief that he feared wholesale movement of transients to Colorado for the purpose of influencing elections. That point was raised in other cases and held not to be valid.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the court vacated the conviction of defendant two. At the trial, the statement of the witness implicating defendant two was not offered into evidence. The witness refused to identify the statement as the one that she made to the police. The only evidence against defendant two was that his physical make-up fit the general description of one of the robbers, i.e., a slender Caucasian male between 5'7&quot; and 5'10&quot; tall. The court held that this evidence alone could not sustain defendant two's conviction. As to defendant one, the court held that the evidence against him was substantial. The court held that testimony about his prior criminal record was admissible because Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city and the county obtained the water through trans-mountain diversions. The ditch companies diverted water for irrigation purposes from the point of discharge of effluent from a sewage treatment plant. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the city and the county had the right of re-use, successive use, and disposition after use of the imported water. However, the court held that the trial court improperly decided that the city and the county lost dominion over the water after it was delivered to customer taps. The court found that the sewage treatment plant was an agent of the city and the county, and the municipalities did not lose dominion over the water delivered to the sewer intake line. The court held that the trial court properly upheld the validity of a 1940 agreement whereby the city and the county committed to certain ditch companies that water would be available for irrigation and would not be diverted after it had been used in the municipal water system. The court noted that the city and county's 1969 agreement whereby the manufacturer was to divert certain imported water was invalid under the 1940 agreement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged in this original proceeding the jurisdiction of respondent trial court and judge to resentence him on his murder conviction. The United States Supreme Court had determined that his death penalty was illegal and upon remand the trial court, pursuant to the direction of the federal court of appeals, imposed a sentence of life imprisonment. Defendant contended that he must be retried.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon his conviction of first-degree murder, defendant was originally sentenced to death. The Supreme Court invalidated the death sentence because the jury was not constitutionally qualified to fix the death penalty. This determination did not affect the jury's finding of guilt. The federal court of appeals directed the trial court to either impose a life sentence without a retrial or the retry defendant. Defendant contended that the trial court had no jurisdiction to impose a different sentence because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-2-3(1) (1963) required that the jury fix the sentence. Section 40-2-3(1) provided only two sentencing options: death and life imprisonment. The court held that the trial court had the authority under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35, originally invoked by defendant, to correct an illegal sentence. The Supreme Court having taken away one of the sentencing options, it was a mere ministerial act, within the power and authority of the trial court, to impose the only other sentence that was available to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In her petition brought under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-6-1 et seq. (1967 Perm.

The petition was dismissed as time-barred under &sect; 22-6-1(2), a limitation statute which provided that no paternity proceeding shall be initiated after a child reached five years of age. Several months later, the mother filed a petition for support under &sect; 22-7-1 et seq., which did not have a similar limitations bar. Over respondent's objection that contested paternity could not be adjudicated under &sect; 22-7-1 et seq., the juvenile court determined that the respondent was the father of the two children, and entered an order for their support. The Colorado Court of Appeals reversed. On review, the state supreme court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court, holding that because a support proceeding under &sect; 22-7-1 et seq. presupposed that paternity already has been established, the mother could only bring actions to establish paternity for purposes of support under &sect; 22-6-1 et seq. and, having failed to bring them before the children, respectively, reached the age of five years, the actions were barred.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found in favor of the board. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that as the meeting was regularly held, notice was not necessary. The court agreed with the trial court's criticism of some of the methods and conduct of the board, but held that the disapproved practices did not invalidate the redistricting plan. The language of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 35-3-2 did not require that the meeting be conducted with the doors physically open, but only that there was free public access. It was not improper for two commissioners to meet with citizens even though a third commissioner was not present.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of theft and conspiracy to commit theft after he took televisions and refrigerators from an appliance warehouse. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. The theft statute under which defendant was charged was not unconstitutionally vague. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-5-2 (Supp. 1967) delineated the four acts which, if done with the intent specified, constituted the crime of theft. If a statute gave a fair description of the conduct forbidden and men of common intelligence could readily apprehend the statute's meaning and application, it would not be declared unconstitutional for vagueness. Section 40-5-2 met this test. The words used by the legislature to define the offense of theft were not ambiguous and did not require any extended or involved interpretation to arrive at their meaning. The court further found that the information charging defendant was adequate, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's motion for a bill of particulars.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The residents challenged two annexations, one encompassing approximately 3,000 acres of land and one encompassing approximately 600 acres. The city engineer testified as to the preparation of the maps and stated that the territory to be annexed was more than two-thirds contiguous with the city for a period of not less than three years, as required under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-21-5(2)(a). The court affirmed on appeal, finding no error. Although the residents objected that the first annexation involved a variance in the description of the territory between the resolution of intent and the description contained in the annexation ordinance, the court found the variance immaterial. All of the area annexed by the ordinance was described in the published notice, as required by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-21-5(2)(b). For the second annexation, the deletion of a 20-acre tract did not terminate the entire proceeding by virtue of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-21-9(1)(c). Only if there was such a tract as would affect the establishment of the boundaries would the statute have caused the annexation proceedings to terminate. Finally, the court found sufficient evidence to support the annexation.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that the classifications created under &sect; 40-11-10 were rationally related to the evils the Colorado legislature sought to cure. The section properly limited possession of firearms by those who, by past conduct, demonstrated an unfitness to be entrusted with dangerous weapons in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Section 40-11-10 clearly was within the scope of the legislature's police power. The court noted that the Equal Protection Clause did not bar reasonable classifications involving similarly situated persons contained in legislation. Rather, groupings were violative of equal protection if the classifications were clearly arbitrary and without any reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was tried before a jury and found guilty of burglary and assault with intent to commit robbery. Defendant was sentenced to consecutive sentences for the offenses. Defendant ultimately filed three motions under Rule 35(b) with the district court, alleging that his consecutive sentences were unconstitutional because there was only one transaction. In his third motion under Rule 35(b), defendant also claimed that the consecutive sentencing constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The district court ruled against defendant on both issues. The court affirmed the district court's judgment, holding that the prior denial of defendant's Rule 35(b) motion in which he alleged that his consecutive sentences were unconstitutional, became a final order, which barred, on the basis of res judicata, that contention from being raised again. As to the issue of whether the sentences constituted cruel and unusual punishment, the court concluded that because the sentences imposed were within the statutory bounds and did not shock the conscience of the court, the two consecutive sentences could not be reversed on the ground that they constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The case had been remanded to the Commission after it had earlier been determined that it was not necessary to show overexertion in order to make compensable an injury or death which resulted from exertion in the usual duties of the employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners argued that the evidence did not show that decedent's work caused his heart attack. Petitioners argument was that the claimants' two physicians characterized the decedent's coronary occlusion as having resulted from &quot;overexertion,&quot; that the Industrial Commission found that there was not overexertion, which the court in effect affirmed in a former opinion, and that on cross-examination it was developed that if there had not been the &quot;overexertion,&quot; which the doctors had in mind, they could not have placed decedent's handling of hay bales as the cause. The court on appeal found that the finding of facts by the Commission were sufficient to show that the decedent's death was the direct and proximate result of his coronary occlusion of May 20, 1966 and that such heart attack occurred as the result of exertion by the decedent in the course of his employment when he was performing duties arising out of and in the scope of his employment. The court also held that an amended statute, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81-2-9 (Supp. 1965), was constitutional and not a violation of procedural due process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, certain members of a political organization and the political organization, challenged a judgment of the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which upheld the validity of 1971 Colo. Session Laws ch. 133, &sect;&sect; 44 and 45 and denied otherwise qualified electors from participating in appellants' initiative because they were between the ages of 18 and 21.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants complained that the Colorado General Assembly had seriously harmed their ability to circulate petitions for an initiative and to gain signatures therefor, by limiting the class of citizens enabled to sign and circulate the initiative petitions to registered electors 21 or older, rather than qualified electors and those 18 years or older. It was axiomatic that there were more citizens of Colorado who have the qualifications to register than there were those who did register. The statutory requirement that the signing and circulating of petitions had to be by registered electors rather than permitting qualified electors to carry on these functions was a limitation not authorized by the constitution and was impermissible. Appellants also contended that qualified electors of the ages of 18 through 20 should have been allowed to participate in the initiative process. The court held that if young voters were allowed to vote for initiated measures they were also allowed to sign and circulate initiative petitions. It was intrinsic to the democratic system that no statutes limit or curtail the constitutional provisions with regard to the initiative.</SPAN></P>

The judgment holding valid a statutory provision restricting the initiative process to those 21 and older was also reversed. The case was remanded to the trial court with directions to enter a judgment not inconsistent with the court's views.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, who were members of the Colorado State Board of Examiners in the Basic Sciences, challenged the decision of the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado) that issued a declaratory judgment in favor of appellee chiropractic association. The district court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 91-5-9(5) (Supp. 1969) violated equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The chiropractic association brought the declaratory judgment action claiming that amendments to statutory qualification requirements violated the equal protection rights of potential practitioners of chiropractic. Under &sect; 91-5-9(5), medical, osteopathic, and podiatry students were permitted to waive the State of Colorado basic science examination if they passed the examination administered by their respective national boards of examiners. Chiropractic students were not permitted to waive the State examination. The district court ruled in favor of the association. The court reversed the judgment, concluding that the association lacked standing to bring the action. It was not an aggrieved party or a party whose interest the statute was designed to protect, but rather was comprised solely of persons who already qualified to practice chiropractic in Colorado. Further, no injury was shown and there was no public interest mandating review. Finally, the court upheld the constitutionality of the statute, finding that the association failed to show that the National Chiropractic Examination was equivalent to the test conducted by the other national boards.</SPAN></P>

The district court held that &sect; 70-1-2(2) was invalid because it violated Colo. Const. art. V,&sect; 1, which vested the right of initiative in the people. The district court found that &sect; 70-1-2(1) was separable from the other provision and was constitutionally permissible. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision striking &sect; 70-1-2(2) because the Colorado legislature was not authorized to impose restrictions which limited the right of the people to initiate proposed laws and amendments, except as those limitations were provided in the Colorado Constitution. The court then reversed the determination that &sect; 70-1-2(1) was valid. The court noted that the two provisions were so intertwined that they were inseverable. The court then held that the legislative intent was not to require publication of proposed initiated laws and amendments at State expense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The teacher was employed as a substitute teacher for the District when she sought tenure, and the concomitant salary increase, under the Act. The District denied her claim and the teacher brought the action to compel the award of tenure and for loss of the increased wages. The District court dismissed the claim, concluding that her reliance upon the Act was misplaced because the Act was not retrospective in operation. The district court held that the proposed imposition of tenure obligations upon the District retroactively was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment, relying upon a different rationale and noting that the constitutional question was not necessary to disposition of the case. The court held that neither the Act, nor its predecessor, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 123-18-1 et seq. (1963), permitted tenure unless a teacher served continuously and without interruption for three full years. The teacher's service as a substitute employee, working varying numbers of days each of the three prior years, did not satisfy the statutory requirements for continuity or three full years' employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While working for a subcontractor, the employee fell from the decking above the ceiling of the premises. The employee received Workmen's Compensation benefits. In his tort action, the employee alleged that the general contractor had negligently installed the decking and that the owner had negligently failed to inspect the faulty decking. The employer argued that &sect;&sect; 81-9-1, 81-9-2 were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court disagreed. The statutes conferred an immunity on a general contractor or a real property owner in exchange for a duty, which inhered to the benefit of the employee. The statutes did not deprive the employee of a property right without due process of law because &sect;&sect; 89-9-1, 81-9-2 did not attempt to remove a right that had already accrued. The statutes did not deny equal protection of the law when the Workmen's Compensation Act met the Fourteenth Amendment test of reasonability, and the legislature could extend workmen's compensation to a particular category of admitted non-employers like the general contractor and owner. Finally, &sect;&sect; 81-91, 81-9-2 were not special and exclusive legislation when the statutes were general and uniform in operation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held the Act to be unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the Act was a constitutional exercise of the State's police power to regulating business. The court also rejected the trial court's holding that terms of the Act were unconstitutionally vague, finding that the terms were either defined in the statute or had common usage. The trial court's finding that the Act violated appellee's rights to equal protection because the state attorney general could either bring suit or agree to voluntary compliance by those accused of violating the Act was also rejected because the choice was reasonably within the discretion of the attorney general.</SPAN></P>

Defendant testified at trial, denying any involvement and claiming that he was chasing the offenders. Defendant's trial was severed from the trial of two co-defendants, who pled guilty to the robbery charges and testified against defendant. On appeal, the court held that the record showed that the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's convictions. The court further determined that most of the delays which had occurred in bringing defendant to trial were directly attributable to defendant based on his filing of requests for continuances.

Plaintiffs, the State and the Colorado Bureau of Mines initiated the proceedings in reliance upon Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 92-33-21(1) (1963).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After several cave-ins occurred on the streets above the abandoned mine, the district court granted the request to require the mining claim owner and the City to secure or fence the openings. The City complied with the injunction by securing the openings that occurred above the mine on the streets. These openings resulted from mine cave-ins. The mining claim owner appealed from the judgment, asserting that &sect; 92-33-21(1) was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment, first finding that &sect; 92-33-21(1) did not violate Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 25 because it did not discriminate impermissibly against mining property. The provision created a reasonable classification, that is, mining property, in order to protect the public from hazards created by abandoned mines. The provision was uniform in its operation upon all mining property owners in a like situation. The court also ruled that the title of the statute, which contained the word &quot;earthworks,&quot; was germane to the content of the legislation and did not cause surprise and deception, as provided in Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 21. Nor was the title of the statute's predecessor applicable for purposes of interpretation.</SPAN></P>

The court on appeal held that it reasonably conveyed the exact nature of the crime charged, including the time and place of its alleged commission. The court further held that the words &quot;unlawfully and feloniously and purposely,&quot; as used in the information, which charged defendant, did sufficiently amount to an allegation of the required intent. Defendant next contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the physical evidence obtained from him and the statements made by him at or about the time of his arrest. Two citizens who had defendant &quot;in custody&quot; stopped police officers. The citizens told the officers what they had seen and done. Defendant's clothing and hands were covered with black grease and defendant was winded and sweaty. This was sufficient evidence to give the officer probable cause that defendant had committed a crime. Therefore, the search of defendant, which disclosed the tools, bolts and clamp, was justified and valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under &sect; 129-2-12(1), the Commission could exclude from Colorado race tracks any person who had violated &quot;any law of the United States or the State of Colorado.&quot; Plaintiff had been convicted of a federal felony. The court held that the authority to exclude any person who had violated any federal or Colorado law was far too broad to be constitutionally valid. To support a directive of exclusion, the violation must be such that the violator's presence at a race track reasonably could be detrimental to the best interests of racing. Under this statute, the Commission could exclude a person who wilfully violated a minor state traffic law, and the vast scope of the exclusion invited arbitrary enforcement. Thus, exclusion by reason of a person's violation of &quot;any law&quot; was an unconstitutional deprivation of liberty.</SPAN></P>

The hospital then made a claim against the patient's estate for the money it spent for his care and maintenance during his hospitalization. The patient sought a set-off against the claim for the services he rendered. The probate court allowed the hospital's claim and denied the set-off. In affirming the decision, the court found that the services provided by the patient were voluntary, optional, and for treatment purposes. Under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 105-4-17 (1963), prisoners were required to perform labor and services for which they were paid. There was no such provision for mentally adjudicated incompetents.

Stat. &sect; 72-1-14 (1)(c) (1965 Perm Supp.). The lower court granted the city's motion for summary judgment, which declared that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 72-1-14(1)(c) was unconstitutional as applied to home rule cities because it violated the home rule provision of Colo. Const. art. XX, &sect; 6 since the statute purported to prevent the city from imposing a business occupational tax upon the insurance companies. On appeal, the insurance companies argued that the regulation of insurance companies was a matter of state, not local concern, and the imposition of taxes was an unauthorized attempt at local regulation.

On appeal, defendant claimed that his statement was inadmissible as the fruit of an illegal arrest because the arrest warrant was issued without probable cause. Defendant also claimed that his statement should have been suppressed on the ground that it was made involuntarily. The appellate court held that arrest warrant should not have been issued because the complaint was void of facts sufficient to establish probable cause. Accordingly, the court reversed the denial of defendant's motion to suppress and remanded to the trial court for determinations of (1) whether defendant's arrest was lawful in the absence of a valid arrest warrant, and (2) if so, whether defendant's statement was voluntary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an ex parte proceeding, police obtained a warrant that authorized the seizure of allegedly obscene materials on the owners' business premises. The officers conducted a thorough search resulting in the seizure of several hundred articles determined to be obscene, suspected bookmaking material, and a small quantity of suspected marijuana found inside a clothes rod in a closet. The district attorney sought to enjoin the owners from importing obscenity and exhibiting, selling, or possessing obscenity in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 40-9-16, 40-9-17 (1963). The district attorney appealed the trial court's decision issuing a temporary injunction because it failed to hold that all the seized items were obscene. The owners appealed the denial of their motion to suppress. The court held that: (1) the search was exploratory as revealed by the discovery of marijuana inside a clothes rod; (2) the search allowed the officers to impermissibly exercise discretion in seizing items; and (3) the process was an unconstitutional prior restraint because the owners did not receive a prior adversary hearing to determine whether the materials in question were obscenity before the seizure.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the products at issue were all wholesome and healthful and that the dressings were manufactured in compliance with local and federal health standards. The products were directly sold to restaurants and hospitals, not to grocery markets. The court concluded there was no fraud being perpetrated by the corporation in the sale of the products. The court held that the statute had no relation to the public health, safety, and welfare and was an invalid exercise of the police power and, therefore, unconstitutional as applied to the corporation's products. No fraud was being perpetrated upon the public that would justify restraining the corporation from selling its products. The findings of the trial court were amply supported by the evidence, which, for the most part, was undisputed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants proposed a charter amendment authorizing and empowering it to issue bonds. The bonds were to be used to defray the city's share of the cost of a municipal urban renewal project. The voters approved the amendment. The bond opponents brought a declaratory action against defendants to declare the amendment invalid. The trial court sustained defendants' motions for a judgment on the pleadings and a dismissal of the complaint. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that although the trial court should have issued a declaratory judgment, because the court upheld the ruling that judgment should be awarded to defendants, remand of the case was not necessary. The court then held that defendants could authorize the bonds for the federal renewal project even though Colo. Const. art. XX, &sect; 1 provided that a city could issue bonds, upon approval of the electors, that were necessary to carry out its powers and purposes as the voters' approval of the amendment conformed with &sect; 1's election requirement for an election on a general bond issue.

As well, defendant appealed the conviction for aggravated robbery and conspiracy to commit the robbery of a store owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At trial, the victim and a customer identified defendant as one of the two perpetrators, and a police officer testified that defendant and a friend were arrested within minutes of the robbery, near the store, with a gun and a paper sack containing money. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in the second sanity trial in denying his motion for a directed verdict. He also maintained that there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the specific intent to main, wound, or kill if resisted as required under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-5-1 (1963). Affirming the verdicts below, the court held that the district attorney was entitled to rely on the presumption of sanity and was not required to put his evidence in prior to defendant's case in chief. Holding that specific intent was inferable from the facts and its proof was necessarily by circumstantial evidence, the court held that defendant's threat to kill the store owner while brandishing a pistol constituted such circumstantial evidence. Further, testimony that defendant looked like he was going to hit the owner was properly admitted as the witness could describe his action in no other way.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police officers had reason to believe that illegal drug trafficking was centered in defendant one's home. They made an application for permission to intercept telephone communications pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-4-30 (1969). The affidavit identified defendant one and listed the offenses as felony possession of marijuana. The order was issued and the police wiretapped defendant one's telephone. In intercepting his conversations, they overheard information incriminating the other defendants, who were subsequently arrested and convicted for possession of narcotic drugs, inter alia. On appeal, defendants attacked the affidavit as insufficient and the wiretap statute as unconstitutional. The court held that the affidavit was sufficient in that it identified defendant one as the target of the surveillance and identified the suspected crimes. The fact that information was inadvertently gathered which incriminated the other defendants did not require them to have also been identified in the affidavit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with aggravated robbery. Two pre-trial line-ups were conducted relating to the possible identification of robbery suspects. Defendant was not placed in the first line-up but was placed in the second one. Of the five persons placed for viewing in defendant's line-up, three of them wore false mustaches, leaving defendant and other with natural mustaches. Defendant's attorney was present, and his line-up requests were honored. Defendant's motion to suppress the in-court identification was denied. Defendant was convicted of aggravated robbery and as a habitual criminal under the HCS. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the line-up procedures did not violate defendant's due process rights because his counsel was present and the line-up resulted in identification with sufficient independent origin. However, the trial court's admonishments to the jury were insufficient to remove the taint of the offensiveness concerning the people's elicitation of defendant's connection with other burglaries.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The People filed a complaint in the County Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) charging defendants, owners and operators of a motel, with violating Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-3(1) (1963) (Illegal Motel Sign). On stipulated facts and written briefs the trial court held &sect; 13-21-3(1) unconstitutional as violative of Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 25. The People sought reversal of that decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's determination that the statute in question was unconstitutional was correct because violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution amounted to special legislation prohibited by Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 25. The statute was designed to protect the traveling public from so-called &quot;bait advertising.&quot; To pass the test of constitutionality, however, the classification implicit in the statute between &quot;auto camps&quot; and hotels (and other omitted types of accommodations) had to be reasonable and based upon a substantial difference which reasonably related to the purpose of the statute. In the past, &quot;motor courts&quot; were factually distinguished from hotels. Today, however, motels and hotels could be distinguished in title only. Both catered to all travelers, and it was unreasonable to say that motels catered to the automobile traveler while hotels did not. Indeed, it was not unusual to find a motel located only a few blocks from a hotel and both equidistant from a highway. Under the circumstances, the court was compelled to find that the statute denied motel owners the equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held in favor of the water association, finding the rules and regulations unconstitutionally discriminated under the equal protection clause and were a violation of due process, and the state engineer appealed. The court ruled that those who insisted that a regulation was invalid must make its invalidity manifest and that there was a wealth of evidence supporting the validity of the regulations. Further, the court held that it did not regard the regulations as unreasonable and vague. The court reversed the judgment in favor of the water association, concluding that regulations and statutes were presumed to be constitutional until shown otherwise and that no such showing was made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The contempt citation was issued on the ground that the creditor had seized and retained a portion of the debtor's assets subsequent to the assignment to the assignee and in violation of the statute.

The court held that the provisions in the statute that provided for discharge of the assignor had been suspended by the Federal Bankruptcy Act but that did not mean that the remaining portions of the statute were also invalid. The court concluded that only upon a hearing on the contempt citation could it have been determined whether the articles of property seized by the creditor were in fact included among those validly assigned to the assignee. If that was established then the citation for contempt was the proper remedy because one who interfered with property in the custody of the law without permission of the court was guilty of contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wives and their husbands moved to Colorado in September 1968 and August 1969, respectively. The husbands enrolled at the University after residing in the state for less than a year and were classified as out-of-state students for tuition purposes. In the fall of 1970, the wives also enrolled at the University. They were classified as out-of-state students. They filed suit against the members of the Committee for an order classifying them as in-state students for tuition purposes. The trial court granted the requested relief. The members of the Committee appealed from that ruling, which was affirmed. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 124-18-3(1)(a)(c) (1963) specified that a married woman's domicile, for purposes of tuition, was normally that of her husband. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 124-18-2(3) (1963) defined a domicile as a person's true, fixed, and permanent home and place of habitation. As of the fall of 1970, the wives and their spouses had maintained a Colorado domicile for more than one year. Therefore, the wives were entitled to in-state tuition under &sect; 124-18-2(2) even though their husbands had been previously classified as out-of-state students.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was sentenced to a reformatory following his conviction for attempted first degree rape.

It alleged that defendant attempted to make an assault upon his victim and attempted to rape his victim in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 40-2-28, 40-2-25, 40-25-1 (1963). The court nevertheless found that the information was sufficient to charge the crime of attempt to commit rape. Further, contrary to defendant's assertion, attempt to commit rape under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-25-1 (1967) was a crime. It was a separate and distinct offense from intent to commit rape under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-2-34 (1963). The court also found that defendant failed to meet his burden to prove that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-25-1 was unconstitutional because there was no assertion that it failed to give fair warning of what was forbidden to men of common intelligence. Finally, the court did not consider defendant's argument concerning a tendered and refused jury instruction because defendant failed to furnish a transcript of the testimony.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that Denver, Colo., Mun. Code art. 116(c), the Employee's Occupational Privilege Tax, could not validly be enforced against the named plaintiffs and against others of the same class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, concluding that the city could not constitutionally tax the state as an employer because the relationship between plaintiffs and the state, whether characterized as a privilege or a right, was a matter of statewide concern and not subject to local taxation under Colo. Const. art. XX. Plaintiffs argued that, while the ordinance was not unconstitutional on its face, it became invalid when applied to them as employees or elected officials of the state. The city contended that plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies under the ordinance. The court found that the equity jurisdiction of the court was properly invoked to avoid a multiplicity of suits. The court held, however, that the city had the right to enact taxes applicable to local matters and that the ordinance was not in clear opposition to state law. The court concluded that reasonable, non-discriminatory taxes could be imposed by one governmental unit upon the employees of another and that application of the city's &quot;head tax&quot; to members of plaintiff classes in no way interfered with, or imposed a condition precedent to employment by the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the burden of proof was upon the prosecution to prove sanity by a mere preponderance of the evidence, whereas the true burden in criminal cases required proof of sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution confessed error in this regard and the court agreed. The court stated that the trial court did not have the benefit of a recent case holding in which Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-8-1(3) (Perm. Supp. 1965) was declared unconstitutional. Because of the reversible error in the trial of the sanity issue, the jury's verdict, which found defendant sane at the time of the commission of the crime, was ordered vacated, was required to be set aside and a new sanity trial held. In all other respects, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Defendant was not misled into believing that defendant had the consent of the trial court to so limit his testimony or that he was unfairly trapped into waiving his protection against comments by the district attorney upon his failure to explain the evidence against him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizen was ordered to appear in the Municipal Court to answer to a complaint charging ordinance violations. The citizen filed an action in the District Court for a writ of prohibition to enjoin the Municipal Court from asserting jurisdiction. The District Court issued the writ. On appeal, the court reversed and vacated the writ. The court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-86-3 (1963), which authorized the filing of a complaint against the citizen in violation of ordinance matters, was not unconstitutional in light of the guarantee under Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 8 that all charges be brought by indictment or information because no such constitutional rights were in issue. The court determined that because Colo. Rev.

He entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. The trial court found that &sect; 39-8-3(1) infringed upon defendant's right to waive a jury trial because it required the consent of the district attorney in order to waive a jury trial on the issue of insanity and ruled that it was unconstitutional. Defendant's motion to waive a jury trial on that issue was granted by the trial court. Thereafter, defendant was found to be insane and was confined to a state hospital. The State sought review of the trial court's order granting defendant's motion. The court disapproved that ruling. It stated that the right to waive a jury trial was not absolute and that reasonable limitations could be placed on that right under the federal and Colorado Constitutions. In that regard, the court noted that statutes providing that only a jury could determine the degree of murder and the penalty in a capital case had been upheld in Colorado. Therefore, the trial court had erred when it ruled that &sect; 39-8-3(1) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the superior court of Denver was a lawfully established statutory court and was not abolished by the 1965 amendment to the state constitution. The repeal of former Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The summons and complaint issued to the accused pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-17-7 (1963) (1965 Perm.

The court rejected the accused's claims that the summons and complaint were defective because it satisfied the minimum requirements of &sect; 37-17-7, and nothing further was necessary. The fact that the judges of the county court were appointed by the mayor of the city and county of Denver did not violate Colo. Const. art. VI. There was no equal protection violation by the authorization in Colo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 26 that permitted Denver to choose its own method for the selection of county court judges, whereas the rest of the state elected them. The court reasoned that due to Denver's geographical position, it being a capital city, and regional commerce center, it was reasonable to give the city a choice of choosing county court judges, and that there was no invidious discrimination in allowing it that option.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the dismissal of the accused's complaint that sought relief in the form a writ of prohibition against the county court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant claimant sought review of the order of the Industrial Commission of the State of Colorado, which awarded him a sum for permanent and total disability from silicosis under the Occupational Disease Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81-18-2 et seq. (1963). The case was appealed directly to the appellate court; however, the court granted certiorari prior to judgment on the basis that the constitutionality of a statute was at issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant became totally and permanently disabled from the disease of silicosis, incurred from exposure to silicon dioxide during 15 years of employment. The claimant contended that he was entitled to a greater award. The court found that the basis for the award was the &quot;escalator clause&quot; contained in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81-18-16 (1963). The claimant argued that &sect; 81-18-16 was unconstitutional in its then-current form and was so in its original legislative enactment, &sect; 16 of the Colorado Occupational Disease Disability Act, 1945 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 163. The court found that the differentiation between permanent partial and permanent total disability from silicosis brought forth wonderment as to what may have been the reasonable basis for the classification. The court, in affirming the Commission's order, refused, however, to rule on the constitutionality of the escalator clause. The constitutional challenge based upon a classification without a valid or reasonable basis was not properly before the court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state challenged the decision of the District Court of Adams County (Colorado), which held that the implied consent state, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-5-30(3) (1967) et seq. was unconstitutional, and in so doing avoided the conviction of defendant for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of &sect; 13-5-30(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under Colorado's implied consent law, a driver who refused a blood test was subject to the sanction of possible suspension of his or her driver's license. The court reversed the judgment, rejecting the contention that the implied consent law did not meet the constitutional requirements of due process. The court held that there was no constitutional right to refuse to surrender blood to determine its alcohol content. The court reasoned that the right to refuse a blood test under Colorado's implied consent law was a statutory right only and as such was subject to the sanction of possible driver's license suspension. The court held that the privilege against self-incrimination was not violated by the statute as the privilege was concerned with and limited to testimonial compulsion, as distinguished from compulsion to exhibit physical characteristics. The court further concluded that the statute was not an impermissible burden on interstate commerce because it was enacted for the purpose of reducing accidents, deaths, and injuries on public highways and was no more burdensome as to interstate commerce than any other traffic regulation enacted for similar public purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the lower judgment, which had declared Colorado's implied consent law unconstitutional and which had avoid the conviction of defendant for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The court remanded the actions with directions to order the reinstatement of the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

After a trial, defendant was convicted on all four counts. On review, the conspiracy convictions were reversed, but defendant's wagering and gambling convictions were affirmed. Defendant sought certiorari and argued that his right to cross-examine two of the State's witnesses was unreasonably restricted. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in failing to grant defendant's motion for a mistrial. Defendant also challenged the admission of certain telephone calls and argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions. The court found that cross-examination was not restricted where the trial court properly determined that an informant's name need not be revealed. The court also found that there was no abuse of discretion in denying a mistrial. The court also found that the telephone calls were not hearsay. The court also found that ample evidence supported the convictions.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-21-1 et seq. (1965).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petition filed by Arvada to annex a developed subdivision and an undeveloped tract was signed by subdivision residents, but not by the owners of the undeveloped tract. Previously, those owners had entered into an agreement to annex the undeveloped tract to Westminster. After a favorable annexation election for Arvada, certain subdivision landowners sued. The annexation was vacated and Arvada appealed. In reversing, the court ruled that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-21-4(3) (1965), which required a valuation of $ 200,000 before owners' consent was required, was not shown to be arbitrary or a violation of equal protection or due process. Also, the requirement under Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Department of Health enacted regulations setting out the minimum sanitary requirements for the operation of a public bathing facility. Plaintiffs alleged that the operators had failed to comply with the regulations. The trial court determined that the operators were in noncompliance and that the regulations as minimum standards were not unreasonable. However, the trial court determined that the power to regulate the bathing facilities had been unconstitutionally delegated to the Department of Health. The court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 66-1-7(1) was sufficiently definite in its direction to the Department of Health in regulating sanitary standards. The court found that the regulations were clearly to apply to public baths. Because the statute was sufficiently specific and the operators' facility fell within the definition of covered facilities, the court determined that the power had not been unconstitutionally delegated to the Department of Health and it did not abdicate the legislative prerogative of making a law.</SPAN></P>

The referee determined that she was entitled to a Special Award under the Colorado Employment Security Act as provided in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 82-4-8(8)(f) (Perm. Supp. 1965) concerning awards to workers who were separated from a job because of pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the claimant returned from her maternity leave, she was advised that there was no job open for her. Under &sect; 82-4-8(8)(f), payment of benefits was deferred until she had worked for 13 weeks subsequent to the termination of her pregnancy. The claimant contended that she was entitled to a Full Award. She also contended that the Special Award section relating to pregnancy was unconstitutional as it unreasonably discriminated against women workers. The court rejected her contentions. The claimant's job would not have been filled if she had not become pregnant and requested maternity leave. She was not laid off for lack of work, nor for any condition for which a Full Award could be made. Further, with the exception of the pregnant worker situation, the Act treated men and women the same for purposes of eligibility and qualification for unemployment benefits. It was only where a woman had become pregnant that she was treated differently. Such a classification founded on the special consideration of pregnancy could not be said to be unreasonable and therefore unconstitutional in light of the disability caused by a condition of pregnancy in relation to her employment responsibilities.</SPAN></P>

Marijuana and L.S.D. were found. Defendants were arrested on drug charges. Defendants filed a motion to suppress as evidence certain narcotics obtained at the residence, which was denied. Defendants appealed a denial of the motion to suppress evidence on the grounds that the search warrant was invalid because it did not set forth a copy of the supporting affidavit, it had erasure marks and insertions on the face of the warrant, and did not state the names of the persons whose affidavits were taken or the grounds or probable cause for its issuance as required by Colo. R. Crim. P. 41(c). The court affirmed because the validity of a search warrant was to be judged in accordance with Colo. R. Crim. P. 41, which did not require that the affidavit be copied into the search warrant or attached thereto. In addition, the court noted that the affidavit presented ample and sufficient facts showing probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants filed an interlocutory appeal from the District Court, Twentieth Judicial District (Colorado), which denied their motion to suppress marijuana seized under a search warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged with possession of marijuana with the intent to induce and aid another to unlawfully use and possess it. Defendants contended that the marijuana seized under a search warrant should have been suppressed because the warrant was allegedly defective and invalid. Affirming denial of the suppression motion, the court held that the warrant was sufficient and valid under Colo. R. Crim. P. 41. The court declared that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-5-11(3) (1965) was unconstitutional because it deprived a court of the discretion it had to exercise in finding probable cause. Section 48-5-11(3), by providing that the judge &quot;shall&quot; issue a warrant, robbed a court of discretion and made it mandatory for a court to issue a warrant. Thus, the validity of the warrant had to be judged under Colo. R. Crim. P. 41. An officer could use information obtained from an informant, and &quot;double hearsay&quot; did not invalidate the warrant. The absence of the name of a city from the warrant was not fatal or prejudicial because there was sufficient clarity as to the location in the minds of all parties involved. The descriptions in the warrant were not so broad that they made it a general warrant.</SPAN></P>

The order of suspension was stayed pending the judgment of the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bondsman made monetary gifts to the administrative officer, the assistant administrative officer, and several employees of a municipal court. The Department, acting by and through the Commissioner, served an order on the bondsman requiring him to show cause why it would have been improper to suspend or revoke his license pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 72-20-6 (1963). Following a hearing, the Commissioner entered an order suspending the bondsman's license for 60 days. On appeal, the bondsman asserted that &sect; 72-20-6 was unconstitutional in that it was vague, it lacked mens rea or criminal intent, and it constituted an unlawful extension of the police power because the bail bond business was not subject to regulation. Affirming, the court held that &sect; 72-20-6 was not vague because it definitely prohibited professional bondsmen from making gifts to court employees. The court also held that the legislature could make a prohibited act a crime without regard to the intent or knowledge of the doer. Finally, the court held that the bail bond business was subject to regulation under Colorado's police power because it was a matter of public concern.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The seller sold poultry to five wholesale purchasers who did not have a sales tax license or store license. The Department, relying on Color. Dept. Revenue Reg. 13, considered the sales to be retail sales and levied the sales tax. The seller sought de novo appeal in the trial court. The trial court dismissed the appeal and the seller sought review. The court reversed and remanded. The court noted that under Reg. 13 a sale was considered a retail sale if made to one not having a sales tax license or store license. The court agreed with the seller that the provision in Reg. 13 describing a retail sale as one made to one not having the appropriate license created only a rebuttable presumption of the nature of the sale. The court noted that the seller introduced evidence showing that the purchasers, although not having sales tax or store licenses, were wholesale purchasers or jobbers. The court cited with approval an opinion holding that the controlling factor in the classification of a sale was the disposition of the goods made by the buyer. The court rejected the Department's argument that the buyers' lack of licenses made the sale taxable even if it were not a retail sale.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it was not constitutionally impermissible to determine the eligibility of private institutions of higher education to grant degrees by reference to criteria established by nationally recognized accrediting associations. The court reversed that part of the judgment, which held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 146-3-3(3)(i) (1967 Perm. Supp.) was unconstitutional as applied to the college.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers brought an unsuccessful action to invalidate the district's budget and mill levy election, which was held pursuant to &sect; 123-38-21 of the Colorado Public School Foundation Act of 1969, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 123-38-21 (Perm. Supp. 1969), on the ground that it wrongfully allowed non-taxpaying electors to vote. The court affirmed the county court's judgment for the district and found that both owners and non-owners of property had a sufficient interest in the school facilities and services to make unconstitutional the limitation of the vote to property owners alone. In its ruling, the court held that the limitation in &sect; 123-38-21 that allowed only taxpaying electors to vote was unconstitutional. The court held that only the word &quot;taxpaying&quot; in &sect; 123-38-21 caused the statute's unconstitutionality, that the word &quot;taxpaying&quot; was severable at all places in the section, and that the section was to be read as if &quot;taxpaying&quot; did not appear therein. Finally, the court held that its decision applied prospectively only to elections held after the date that its opinion became final and to those elections held before such date that were challenged within the time permitted by law.</SPAN></P>

The department was preparing to initiate proceedings to revoke the driver's license after he refused to submit to a chemical blood alcohol test when arrested from driving while intoxicated. The lower court found the statute unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement. The department brought this proceeding for a rule to show cause against the judge that issued the injunction. The court agreed with the department that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to restrain the administrative agency from the execution of its statutory duties. Relief, if warranted, would be available to the driver by administrative review and by judicial review after final administrative action. The agency was not acting in excess of its statutory authority so any judicial action in advance of final administrative action was premature.</SPAN></P>

The instruction conformed to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-8-1 (1963), as amended. The statute, and the instruction, were thereafter declared to be unconstitutional. The court held that defendant's conviction, therefore, had to be reversed and remanded for a new trial on the issue of defendant's sanity. As to the guilt phase of the trial, the court held that defendant was not entitled to an instruction on simple robbery because he had manifested the specific intent to maim or kill when he shot at police as he fled from the scene of the crime.

When the area encompassing that barber shop was annexed to a city, he stopped operating on Sundays based upon Colo. Rev.

The city to which his barber shop became annexed was a city of the second class. The barber filed an action seeking to have the statute declared unconstitutional. The trial court found in favor of the barber and the government officials appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the statute was a violation of the equal protection clause under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because it unreasonably singled out barbers in cities of the first and second class. The court found that there was no reasonable state of facts bearing a reasonable relation to the purpose behind Sunday closing laws which justified the classification made by the statute.

The court further found that defendant failed to make a timely objection to the failure to charge at trial. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the lower court erred in finding that he waived his right to counsel when he gave a statement to the police. The court noted that defendant had previously experienced arrest and conviction and that in this case he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 66-8-7 (1963). Plaintiffs in error challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 66-8-7 (1963) stated that a death that occurred without medical attendance had to be reported to the coroner. The department construed the statute so that a death under the care of a chiropractor was a death occurring without medical attendance. Plaintiffs in error argued that attendance by a chiropractor should be deemed medical attendance. The trial court held for defendants in error, and the court affirmed. Under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 91-1-6(3)(n), those persons licensed to practice in a limited field of the healing arts were confined strictly to the field for which they were licensed. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1-1 (1963) defined chiropractic as a branch of the healing arts. Chiropractors did not have the right to practice surgery, obstetrics, or to prescribe drugs. The court held that a chiropractor, who was circumscribed in his practice to diseases involving the functioning of the nervous system, was not legally qualified to make the examinations and judgments necessary to be able to complete the death certificate.</SPAN></P>

He was later convicted of a crime in another state and sentenced to life in that jurisdiction under the habitual criminal laws of that state. In part, his sentencing as a habitual criminal was dependent upon his conviction in Colorado. Thus, he sought to have that conviction reviewed by a writ of error. Though the writ of error had previously been required to be filed within one year, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-7-26 (1963) was enacted requiring that an application for such writ be filed within six months of the date of judgment and sentence. Defendant argued that the one year rule was still in effect when he was incarcerated and sentenced but the court found that the rule stated its effective date and was in effect and applicable to defendant. Thus, defendant's writ of error was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-5-159 (1963) was unconstitutional. The district court voided the law and enjoined its enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The motorcyclists brought a successful action for declaratory and injunctive relief from the helmet law. The court reversed the district court's judgment that the helmet law was unconstitutional and found that its enactment was within the State's police power. In its ruling, the court found that the evidence showed a higher frequency of serious head injury and death among motorcyclists who did not wear helmets as compared to motorcyclists that did wear them. The court noted that persons often became public charges because of their prolonged hospitalization for serious injury and that families often required public welfare support as a result of their breadwinners' deaths. That was pertinent because the State's police power related to the public's financial safety, as well as to the public's health and physical safety. As such, the State could use its police power to pass laws, such as the helmet law, to protect the public from financial loss. The helmet requirement for motorcycle riders bore a reasonable relationship to the health, safety, and welfare of the rest of the motoring public, and the motorcyclists did not meet their burden of proving that the law was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was observed &quot;trying doors&quot; to the various business establishments. The officer observed defendant for a period and then the officer attempted to question defendant. To the officer, defendant's eyes appeared glassy and his pupils were dilated. Defendant gave the officer his address but refused to state his name, insisting that he had no obligation to do so. Defendant was taken to the police station because he refused to state his name. He then stated his name, and promptly thereafter, he was charged with vagrancy. Certiorari was granted to determine if a federal district court decision might persuade the court to overrule a prior Supreme Court of Colorado decision that held the ordinance under which defendant was charged was not violative of due process. The court held that the ordinance permitted varied applications to the same act of a person because of the term &quot;giving a satisfactory account of himself.&quot; The court held the term was simply too overbroad and vague to meet constitutional requirements. Therefore, that portion of the vagrancy ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Colo. Rev.

Defendant argued that the legislative distinction in &sect; 154-1-1 between civil and criminal actions was unreasonable and arbitrary, and that the failure to include witnesses in criminal actions under the same rule applied to witnesses in civil actions was a denial of equal protection of the law. The court found that there was a reasonable basis for the distinction. Next, the court found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for mistrial. The integrity of the trial process was maintained, and the conduct of the prosecuting attorney was not so prejudicial that defendant was denied his right to a fair trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with unlawful possession of cannabis.

The trial court determined that &sect; 48-5-2 was unconstitutional and entered a judgment of acquittal. The People filed a writ of error, and the court disapproved of the order of the trial court. The court held that the inclusion of cannabis in the same category as addictive drugs and other drugs, which were more potent, was not so arbitrary and unreasonable as to deny defendant equal protection and due process. The legislature was free to adopt any classification it deemed appropriate to promote the general welfare where the classification bore a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose and was neither arbitrary nor discriminatory and operated equally on all persons within the classification. A prosecutor had the discretion to prosecute defendant for use of cannabis, which was a misdemeanor, and to prosecute him for possession, which was a felony, because they were two distinct offenses which arose out of the same transaction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the jury trial on the sanity issue, the trial court had instructed the jury that the people had the burden of proof to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant was sane at the time of the alleged commission of the offense. The instruction adhered to the statutory requirement of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-8-1 (1963), as amended by 1965 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 125. Defendant alleged that the instruction permitting the prosecution to establish defendant's sanity merely by a preponderance of the evidence was prejudicial and that the statute upon which it was based was an unconstitutional deprivation of due process of law. On appeal, the court agreed that the instruction constituted prejudicial error. The court held that 1965 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 125, insofar as it permitted the People to establish an accused's sanity by a preponderance of the evidence, was a denial of due process of law and thereby unconstitutional. The court also held that defendant's assignments of error relating to the substantive portion of the trial were without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a junior college district and superintendents of schools, sought review of a decision of the District Court, Thirteenth Judicial District (Colorado), which entered judgment that Senate Bill 405 was unconstitutional. The bill created a junior college district subject to approval by the electors of the district. The suit was brought by appellee individual to nullify the establishment of the relevant junior college.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individual had brought suit to nullify the establishment of the junior college on two grounds: (1) that the district organization election was invalid; and, (2) that Senate Bill 405 was unconstitutional. The trial court upheld the validity of the election, but declared that Senate Bill 405 was unconstitutional. The issue was whether the existing general junior college law was applicable, within the intendment of Colo. Const. art. 5, &sect; 25, so as to preclude valid enactment of the special law, Senate Bill 405. On appeal, the court held that it was for the legislature, and not the court, to make the initial answer to the question. Whether a general law could not be made applicable, so as to permit thereby a special law, was a discretionary determination to be made by the legislature, which was not reviewable by the court unless a palpable abuse of discretion was shown. The court found no showing of an abuse of legislative discretion, either palpable or otherwise. The court held, therefore, that there was no basis in law for a judicial declaration that Senate Bill 405 contravened Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 25, and that the presumption of constitutionality prevailed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court upheld the city's actions. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-10-2(e) (1963) allowed for annexation without the owners consent. Also Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-21-4(3) (1963), which prevented the annexation without owner's consent for 20 acres of land or more, did not apply to enclaves. The owners waived the issue of the failure of service by making an appearance at trial. The court further found that there was no evidence that permit to build a service station was ever issued. Moreover, in order for the owners rights in the permit to vest they were required to take some steps in reliance of the permit, which was not done.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners filed an action alleging that provisions of the Act were unconstitutional under the Civil Service Amendment, Colo. Const. art. XII, &sect; 13, on the basis that they excluded certain officials from civil service. The court found that certain provisions of the act were unconstitutional. The court held that petitioners had standing to challenge the statutory provisions where they had an interest in the form of government and they stated a justiciable controversy because they claimed a violation of the Civil Service Amendment, which was self-executing. The court determined the plain meaning of the Civil Service Amendment was controlling and that the amendment precluded the extension of additional exemptions from civil service. The court concluded that provisions of the Act, 1968 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 53 &sect;&sect; 17(1), 18(1), and 25(1), that gave civil service exemption status to confidential employees of the governor were unconstitutional because the duties of the departments in which the employees' headed were the antithesis of confidential.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a recreational district and property owners, appealed a judgment of the District Court, Seventeenth Judicial District (Colorado), which granted motions filed by defendant excluded owners to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint alleging that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89-12-(8)(1) (1963) violated Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3, which provided that all taxes were to be uniform on each of the classes of real and personal property located within the district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs argued that &sect; 89-12-8(1) violated equal protection principles because it included their property in a class that was subject to recreational tax assessments while placing the excluded owners' property in a class that was not. On appeal, the court disagreed. According to precedent, the Colorado Legislature was permitted to create classifications of property to be taxed for specific purposes as long as the classifications were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary and as long as they had sanction in reason and logic. Section &sect; 89-12-8(1) specifically prohibited recreational tax assessments against certain types of non-residential property and allowed owners of property improperly included within the district to petition for exclusion. The court held that &sect; 89-12-8(1) was clearly reasonable because the excluded property did not benefit from or have any use for the recreational resources supported by the tax. Moreover, the tax was uniformly applied against all property that was included within the created class subjected to the tax assessment. Thus, the court held that &sect; 89-12-8(1) was a valid exercise of legislative power and that the complaint was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board's sewer project was initiated under the authority in Colo. Rev.

The engineer argued that the statute's definition of &quot;public project,&quot; even as limited to the public health, was so vague, uncertain, and broad that it was a constitutionally defective delegation of legislative power to the board, in violation of the general rule that counties had only those powers which were expressly delegated to them by the legislature. The court pointed out, however, that it would have placed an unwarranted burden upon the legislature to specify each and every service that the county could have lawfully undertaken. The court held that giving the board authority to acquire, construct, and maintain public projects defined in the act to promote public health was not so broad or vague as to be unconstitutional. The court also held that a sanitary sewer system was within the statutory definition of &quot;public project.&quot; Finally, Colo. Rev.

He later named the woman as the person who shot the victim, and entered a guilty plea to being an accessory after the fact of murder. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-1-13 was not so vague as to be unconstitutional. The statute gave fair warning of the conduct forbidden and men of common intelligence could readily apprehend its meaning and application. The trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motion for a bill of particulars. The disposition of the motion was within the trial court's discretion, no abuse of that discretion was shown, and the ruling was not subject to reversal. Admitting his confession into evidence prior to the corpus delicti having been independently established was not error, especially as trial was to the court and not a jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant irrigator appealed an order from the District Court of Pueblo County (Colorado), which granted judgment to plaintiff state in its cause of action to enforce Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 148-11-22 (1963) and enjoined the irrigator from pumping and using water from his well which tapped into the alluvium of the Arkansas River.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The irrigator's use of his well caused there to be insufficient water for the use of downstream users, who had senior rights. A state water official notified the irrigator to cease pumping water from his well. At trial, the irrigator asserted that &sect; 148-11-22 was unconstitutional. The trial court issued a permanent injunction against the irrigator. On appeal, the court noted that river water was overappropriated. The court rejected the irrigator's argument that the state failed to prove that his use of water injured a particular senior appropriator. The court held that an official could make a finding that the water usage of a junior appropriator, the irrigator, was generally damaging to senior appropriators. The court examined the official's method of determining which wells should be closed and held that he acted without prescribed guidelines. Thus, his resulting actions were unfounded. The official's enforcement of &sect; 148-11-22 was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25. The court determined three constitutional requirements for the enforcement of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 148-11-22 and ordered the official to comply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment for the state, holding that the official had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in enforcing the state water rights statute. The court dissolved the injunction prohibiting the irrigator from using his well, but it ordered him to cooperate with the state's future investigation of effective and reasonable water rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On application by petitioner City, the court issued a show cause order to respondents, the District Court for Adams County (Colorado), its Chief Judge, and corporate and individual property owners, to show why the trial court had jurisdiction to issue a stay of the City's post-annexation plans to apply pertinent ordinances to the annexed area pending resolution of the owners' attack on the validity of the City's annexation proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City argued that the trial court was statutorily precluded from staying the proceedings. On appeal, the court agreed. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-21-16(1) (Supp. 1965) required the City to apply all pertinent ordinances to the annexed area irrespective of any proceedings for judicial review. Section 139-21-16(1) was mandatory; as such, absent a finding of inapplicability or unconstitutionality, a trial court lacked jurisdiction to order the City to disobey that mandate. Further, the power of courts to issue stay orders in certiorari proceedings was subject to statutory modification or abrogation and &sect; 139-21-16(1) was clearly intended to preclude the issuance of a stay order pending appeal of annexation proceedings. Moreover, Colo. R. Civ. P. 81(a) provided that the Rules of Civil Procedure were inapplicable insofar as they were inconsistent with special statutory law; thus, the stay order authorization otherwise given in Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(a)(4) did not apply to the instant case. Finally, the court held that the trial court's order was actually one for an injunction or restraining order. As such, it was an unconstitutional interference with the City's statutory powers and duties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, the Colorado Commissioner of Agriculture, sought a writ of prohibition commanding respondents, the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), a district judge, dairy corporations, and their principal, to show cause why the trial court should not have been prohibited from staying by writ of prohibition a hearing involving the corporations' refusal to comply with a milk marketing order issued by the Commissioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dispositive issue was whether the trial court had jurisdiction under Colo. R. Civ. P. 106 to prohibit the Commissioner from conducting the hearing, which was authorized by the Colorado Agricultural Marketing Act (Act). On appeal, the court answered that inquiry in the negative. Rule 106 limited the issuance of orders in the nature of prohibition to cases where an inferior tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction or abused its discretion in exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions and where there was no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy. Colo. Rev. Stats. &sect;&sect; 7-3-16, 7-3-19 (1963) conferred upon the Commissioner the sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hold hearings and seek judicial enforcement of orders issued under the Act. In the instant case, there was no abuse of discretion because the Commissioner had not yet acted when the trial court's prohibition order was issued. Finally, the Colo. R. Civ. P. 106 claim did not confer jurisdiction upon the trial court to interfere with a department of the executive in advance of its taking final action. Thus, the court held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to interfere with the Commissioner's proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The attorney claimed that &sect; 39-10-17 was unconstitutional because, among other things, it offended Colo. Const. art. III, concerning distribution of powers. Additionally, the attorney claimed that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-10-17 (1963) also conflicted with other provisions of the state constitution. The court denied the attorney's petition. In reaching its decision, the court held that &sect; 39-10-17 did not interfere with the court's exclusive right to determine the rules and regulations which governed those seeking admission to the bar. The court further found that the statute did not impinge upon the court's right to discipline those licensed by the court to practice law.

On appeal of the denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus, the court noted that the father cited no authority supporting his contention that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-1-6 (1963) was unconstitutional because the surrender of the accused to the demanding state was at the discretion of the governor. The governor's discretion was not a completely arbitrary one but could have been exercised only upon a lawful demand or request from the executive authority of another state. The statute did not require that the trial court find that the accused committed an intentional act. Rather, the question of intent was relevant only to the sufficiency of the demand for extradition. It was not an element to be proved in the responding state. Instead, it was a jurisdictional fact that was required to appear from the face of the supporting documents. The trial court was thus under no duty to admit the evidence to prove that the father was financially unable to make the support payments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statute regulated the marketing of agricultural products.

The court agreed with the trial court's ruling that the Commissioner's findings were in substantial compliance with the statute. There was ample support in the record for the Commissioner's findings.

The court upheld the judgment. The court did not find any error in the district court's decision to allow the doctors to testify to the fact that they had twice examined defendant. The court found no error in admitting into evidence a notebook that contained photographs of the victims without authentication because it was clear that the drawing and poems in the book referred to the three victims and were defendant's handiwork; further, the evidence tended to strongly corroborate the testimony of the three victims. The court found no error in the district court's refusal to require the People to elect with respect to each count the particular acts upon which it intended to rely because the evidence only tended to show one particular transaction.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's order was made a final judgment in accordance with Colo. R. Civ. P. 58(h).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">It was stipulated that the tracts of land in issue were primarily used for agriculture. It was also undisputed that the property owners were entitled to have their tracts excluded under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89-12-8 (1963). On appeal, the district argued that &sect; 89-12-8 was unconstitutional. The court ruled that the district lacked standing to attack the constitutionality of the statute under which it was organized. The court explained that only persons whose rights were directly affected by &sect; 89-12-8 were entitled to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. In so ruling, the court applied a prior decision wherein an agency challenged the validity of a municipal ordinance on equal protection grounds. Like that prior case, the district was not entitled to attack a statute on equal protection grounds because the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution and the Colorado Constitution were not designed to protect state instrumentalities from state action. The court also distinguished cases cited by the district by applying the general rule that a court should not inquire into the constitutionality of a statute unless the question was raised by a proper party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Certain qualified electors filed an action for a declaratory judgment three days after a municipal election was held, requesting the district court to declare an ordinance modifying the boundaries of the city's nine councilman districts, null and void. At trial, the district court reviewed evidence of wide variations among the districts and population statistics based on the 1960 federal census, but upheld the ordinance. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the ordinance's apportionment scheme based upon the number of registered voters, with its wide disparities in the respective districts, violated the city's charter and the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Therefore, the court, while holding the ordinance invalid as violating the &quot;one person one vote&quot; principle, refused to declare the recent city council election void but instead, directed the district court to reinstate the action and retain jurisdiction to assure that the next city council election would be held according to a lawful standard of apportionment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had pleaded guilty to a charge of unlawful and felonious possession of marijuana and he had been sentenced to a term of 6 to 10 years in the state penitentiary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant waived his right to counsel at his arraignment and pled guilty. He filed a motion under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(b) and an evidentiary hearing was conducted. He claimed that his guilty plea had been coerced. At the hearing there was conflicting testimony between defendant and the arresting officers regarding what promises, if any, were made to defendant if he cooperated. In reviewing the writ of error, the court held that the record of the Rule 35(b) hearing adequately supported the trial court's conclusion that the plea was not coerced and that the trial court's conclusion was binding on the court. Defendant also claimed that the statute criminalizing the use and possession of marijuana imposed cruel and unusual punishment, and that his sentence inflicted cruel and unusual punishment on him. The court noted that the classification of marijuana as a narcotic was not unconstitutional. The legislature determined the punishment for particular conduct deemed to be a danger to the public safety and welfare. A sentence that was within the statutory limits and that did not shock the conscience of the court was not cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The optometrists brought suit individually and as representatives of the class. The trial court granted a temporary restraining order ex parte and, after a hearing, entered its order granting a preliminary injunction restraining the board from enforcing its regulation. The court affirmed. Such an order was reviewable by writ of error under Colo. R. Civ. P. 111(a)(3). No determination on the merits of the validity of Regulation No. 11 had been made. The district court had jurisdiction to issue the injunction, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 3-16-5. Under &sect; 3-16-5, judicial review, including injunctive relief, was available to persons aggrieved by agency &quot;action&quot; where irreparable damage would otherwise result. Regulation No. 11 was final agency action subject to the provisions of &sect; 3-16-5. The court overruled Colorado State Board of Examiners of Architects v. Rico, which held that a declaratory judgment could not be brought to secure a judicial determination of the validity of a statute that adversely affected a particular person, and that the remedy was to violate the statute and raise the invalidity as a defense to a prosecution for the violation.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that voter approval was not required under either art. XI, &sect; 8 or the city charter because the city's obligation under the ordinance to take over payment of the bonds was contingent and thus no debt was created. The court also determined that art. XI, &sect; 8 was not binding on the city because it was a &quot;home rule&quot; city operating under charter, as authorized by Colo. Const. art. XX. The court also found that the provision of the ordinance that called for the appointment of a receiver to collect assessments did not constitute an impermissible delegation of power to a nongovernmental entity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs in error, the State of Colorado and the Colorado State Hospital, filed a writ of error to the judgment of the Probate Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which denied its claim for reimbursement from defendant in error, the estate of a ward of the State, of the expenses associated with the Colorado State Hospital's care and maintenance of the ward who had been declared criminally insane and who had been hospitalized.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ward was found by a jury to be legally insane at the time of the commission of the alleged murder and insane at the time of the verdict. He was committed to the hospital. He was adjudicated a mental incompetent by the probate court and his daughter was appointed conservatrix. He was in receipt of a veteran's pension. The State and the hospital, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71-1-16 (1963), as amended by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71-7-1 (1965 Perm. Supp.) filed a claim against the estate to recoup the costs of his care and maintenance. The probate court denied the claim on the grounds that the statute was unconstitutional as it applied to a person adjudicated as criminally insane. The court held that there were other additional statutes that permitted the State to recoup the costs of incarceration or institutionalization, and that the difference in the manner of recovery for the costs of a convicted criminal and one hospitalized as criminally insane was not unreasonable. The statute grouped the criminally insane with all others adjudicated mentally ill for the purpose of recouping costs from the person's estate, and the classification was not unreasonable or unequal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause with instructions to allow the claims of the hospital and to enter judgment for the hospital in the amount stipulated by the parties.</SPAN></P>

The claimant was injured after he had reported for work.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant was found lying unconscious with blood running from his ears. It was later found that he had sustained a fracture inside his skull in addition to bruises and abrasions on his face, head, and forearms. The claimant surmised that a forklift truck had struck him, but he had no actual idea what had happened to him. The Commission's referee found that he had been injured while at work but found the injury was not compensable because the claimant failed to prove that his injury arose out of his employment. The Commission adopted the findings and the trial court affirmed the denial of the claim. In his writ of error, the claimant contended that there was a presumption that where there was an unexplained injury it arose out of the employment. He also claimed the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applied, and that the Workmen's Compensation Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. ch. 81 (1963) was unconstitutional if it deprived him of his right to sue his employer on a common law basis. The court held that the claimant was obligated to show a direct causal relationship between his employment and his injuries. Res ipsa loquitur did not apply. The Act's exclusive remedy was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Their motion was denied, and the juveniles filed an original proceeding with the court. The court found that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 22-1-3(3), 22-1-4(a), and 22-1-4(b) of the Code indicated quite clearly that it was the expressed intent of the general assembly that a child under 18 could only be charged with the commission of a felony in the manner permitted by the Code itself. The court disagreed with the district court that those particular sections of the Code were in conflict with Colo. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The committee proposed a plan for the reorganization of certain school districts, which was approved at an election. The school district filed a declaratory judgment action to have the plan declared null and void. The district also sought a judgment declaring that the School District Organization Act of 1957, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 123-25-1 (1963) et seq., pursuant to which the committee was created, violated certain constitutional provisions. The trial court dismissed the district's complaint. On appeal, the court held that the legislature had plenary powers to determine the number, nature, and powers of school districts and that, therefore, the district had no right to the school property formerly within its jurisdiction and no right to control or operate public schools in that geographical area. The court also found that the Act did not improperly delegate legislative powers to the committee. The court stated that the committee did depart from statutory requirements in the designation of director districts within the new district by creating an unjustified disparity in population in those director districts. The court concluded, however, that this variance was not fatal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed that part of the trial court's decision upholding the creation of director districts with substantially disparate populations and remanded the cause to the trial court with directions to order the preparation and adoption of a plan in conformance with statutory requirements. The court affirmed that part of the trial court's decision upholding the plan for the reorganization of the school districts.</SPAN></P>

Laws 443, he could not be charged with a felony. The trial court denied his motion to dismiss or to transfer to juvenile court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When he was only 15, the juvenile was charged with the felony of assault with a deadly weapon. He sought to have the charges dismissed or the case transferred to the juvenile court, arguing that under the Children's Code, he could not be charged with a felony because he was under 16. After the district court denied the motion, the instant proceeding was filed before the court, challenging the district court's jurisdiction to try the juvenile on the felony charge. The court agreed with the juvenile that the Code barred, without exception, the institution of a felony charge against a child under 16 years of age. The Code provisions did not, in the court's view, offend Colo. Const. art VI, &sect; 9, which provided that the district courts had original jurisdiction in all criminal cases. The constitution did not specifically define what a criminal case was, so it was left to legislature to create and define crimes. In the Children's Code, the legislature had clearly expressed the intent that a child could not be charged with a felony, and juvenile proceedings were fundamentally different from criminal prosecutions. Thus, the district court should have dismissed the charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court made its rule to show cause absolute, and the trial court was ordered to grant the juvenile's motion to dismiss, without prejudice to the State's right to institute a delinquency proceeding against the juvenile in the juvenile court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A hearing was held before a panel regarding the dismissal of appellant teacher. The panel found that the allegations against her were not substantiated by the evidence. Appellee school board rejected the panel's findings and dismissed the teacher. Appellee, the Colorado Commissioner of Education, upheld the dismissal. The teacher challenged a judgment of the District Court, Fourth Judicial District (Colorado), which affirmed her dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the teacher argued that the panel hearing provisions of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 123-18-7(5) (1963) were unconstitutional; that if the provisions were constitutional, then the statutory procedure was flagrantly disregarded; and that the evidence failed to support the charges. The court held that the panel hearing procedures were not an unconstitutional delegation of a municipal function to a special commission. The panel merely conducted the hearing, and the board was empowered to accept or reject the panel's recommendations. Thus, the municipal function of determining whether to cancel a teacher's contract abided in the board. The court held that the naming of the panel was not done according to the statute, but the result would not have been different even if a rehearing was granted under a duly constituted panel. The court, however, found that the record was insufficient to sustain the teacher's dismissal. The teacher had been charged with neglect of duty, incompetency, and insubordination. The grounds upon which the board relied for dismissal were either not related to the charges or not supported by evidence in the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which had affirmed the cancellation of the teacher's contract.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners, after being licensed, were served with written notice of 10 purported violations of the Board's rules in the operation of their college. Two of the purported violations were of Colo. Rev.

The owners denied the charges at a hearing before the Board and again in the trial court where they also asserted that the statute was unconstitutional because of a lack of statutory standards. The trial court upset the license revocation and held the statute unconstitutional for that reason. On appeal, the court found that the statute adequately provided standards and guidelines under which the Board could and did promulgate its rules, which the owners were found to have violated, after a hearing before the Board. The court found further that the Board was justified in revoking the owners' license either for the violation of its rules and regulations, as charged, or under its inherent power so to do under the police power of the state for the protection of the public.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's order. The court held that the trial court erred in declaring that the Act was unconstitutional. The court concluded that the classification of subdividers under the Act was based upon a need, which the legislature believed was justified, to require registration and certain information from large subdividers for the benefit and financial safety of the public.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee sustained an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment. The Public Employees' Retirement Association of Colorado (PERA) granted him a disability annuity. The State Compensation Insurance Fund, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81-12-1(5)(a) and (b) (1963), asked the Commission to reduce the benefits because of the annuity granted to the employee. The court determined that the statute was not limited to private employees and was not restricted to private pension plans. The court explained that its application was not confined to temporary disability benefits. The court noted that the statutory definitions of &quot;employees&quot; and &quot;employer&quot; were such as to include employees of the State. The court concluded that the General Assembly intended to require a reduction in benefits where the employer had already purchased a disability pension or annuity plan for his employee. The court determined that the General Assembly was of the view that an injured employee should not be permitted to receive &quot;double&quot; disability benefits. The court held that the statute did not impinge on any of the rights guaranteed by either the state or federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife claimed that her action for wrongful interference with the marital relationship was not an action for alienation of affections, and that &sect; 41-3-1, which had abolished such actions, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the dismissal of the wife's complaint. The court held that the complaint alleged what was substantially an action for alienation of affections because the alleged losses of society and services, pain, suffering, and humiliation all arose out of a relationship. To the extent that the complaint alleged loss of property, relief could not be granted in this action because the wife had already commenced an action for separate maintenance in which her property rights arising out of the marriage would be adjudicated. The statute did not violate Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 6 by depriving the wife of a remedy for an intentional wrong because the constitutional provision was directed at the judiciary, not at the legislature, and the legislature had inherent police power to abolish common law rights. The title of the bill by which Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-3-1 was passed sufficiently described its contents to comply with Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 21.</SPAN></P>

The trucking companies had filed a declaratory judgment action that sought to overturn three separate resolutions by the board that prohibited commercial trucks and vehicles from driving on county roads through residential areas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trucking companies hauled large amounts of sand and gravel over county roads. They filed suit because the board's regulation kept them from using county roads in residential areas. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment because: 1) the board was a local authority as defined by Colo. Rev. Stat. 13-1-1(30) (1963) and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-5-7 (1963) allowed local authorities to regulate traffic on non-state roads; 2) Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-5-128(3) (1963) constitutionally delegated power to the board because it set forth adequate standards to govern the board's adoption of traffic regulations for commercial vehicles; 3) the regulations were not discriminatory because they contained a reasonable classification for the protection of the health and safety of residential neighborhoods based on a distinction that was not arbitrary; 4) the regulations did not violate due process because the right to use the public streets did not include the right to use the streets without any control or regulation; and 5) the board regulation did not create a crime, it simply determined a set of facts upon which a traffic violation penalty statute would become operative.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners sought the issuance of a rule to show cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, defendants below, were personally served with a copy of the complaint and the summons in Utah. The district court denied petitioners' motion to dismiss on the ground of personal jurisdiction. Petitioners, who were residents of Utah, appeared in Colorado and successfully negotiated a loan. Petitioners executed a promissory note. A renewal note was later executed in Utah and sent by mail to Colorado. The fact that the renewal note was executed in Utah formed the springboard for the present controversy. The court held that the claim arose under the long arm statute, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-1-26 (1963), because petitioners transacted business within Colorado. The court determined that the long arm statute did encompass the present factual situation. There was a showing of &quot;purposeful acts,&quot; performed within Colorado. Due process required only that in order to subject a defendant to a judgment in personam, if he was not present within the territory of the forum, he had to have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit did not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The principal issue on appeal was whether the city's ordinances constituted a valid exercise of the police powers of the city. The corporations took the position that the ordinances did not have a substantial and real relation to the promotion of the public health, welfare and safety, but in fact were detrimental to the public health, welfare and safety. The corporations also contended that the ordinances deprived them of their property without due process of law; that they denied them equal protection of the laws; and that the ordinances were discriminatory and created classifications which had no real basis in fact. The court held that the evidence clearly demonstrated that the danger of unloading gasoline from a vehicle having a capacity in excess of 2,200 gallons was not greater than the danger encountered in unloading gasoline from a vehicle having a capacity of less than 2,200 gallons. The court further held that the subject ordinance necessarily involved a greater exposure to hazard and accident, and therefore a greater danger to the public health, welfare, and safety of the city and its populace. Therefore, the city exceeded its authority in passing the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court treated the parolee's petition as an original proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parolee was recommitted to the penitentiary for an alleged violation of the terms of his parolee. He filed a petition for habeas corpus, which the trial court dismissed as invalid on its face due to improper venue. The trial court declined to rule on the parolee's motion to proceed in forma pauperis and taxed costs against the parolee. The parolee sought further relief, which the court treated as an original proceeding to obtain an order to show cause. The court determined that the trial court's refusal to rule on the parolee's motion to proceed in forma pauperis violated his due process and equal protection rights under the state and federal constitutions on the basis of poverty. The court noted that there was no difference between the &quot;invidious discrimination&quot; caused by a fee imposed prior to filing a petition and costs saddled on the parolee after the dismissal of his petition. Both practices had deterrent effects and violated the prisoner's constitutional right to sue for his liberty. The court further prohibited the practice by trial courts of ordering a warden to withhold a prisoner's funds for the payment of court costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined that the trial court erred in refusing to rule on the parolee's motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, in assessing costs against the parolee, and in ordering the warden to remit funds belonging to the parolee to the clerk of the court for payment of the costs. The court instructed the trial court to vacate the portion of its order assessing costs and to order a refund of all monies remitted on behalf of the parolee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complainants filed a complaint in the district court against the nonresident for damages arising out of an automobile collision. Pursuant to the provisions of the long-arm statute, the nonresident was personally served in Pennsylvania. He filed a motion to quash, asserting that the statute was unconstitutional and, even if deemed constitutional, could not be given retrospective effect by applying it to a tortious act that occurred prior to its effective date. The district court granted the motion and entered an order quashing the purported service of process on the ground that the statute could not have a retroactive effect. The complainants initiated an original proceeding for an order directing the district court to vacate its order. The court directed the district court and the judge to vacate the order granting the motion to quash and to then deny the motion. The court held that an original proceeding was proper because an order of quashal was not a final judgment subject to review by writ of error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company raised several assertions regarding the decision and contended that it violated the Due Process and Just Compensation Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The court decided that the assertions were not true. The court concluded that its decision did not deny the company's authority to furnish electric energy to the members it acquired when it applied for the certificate. The court found that the decision did, however, deny the company permission to expand its facilities and spread its service areas to encompass those already served by other certificated suppliers of electrical energy. The decision protected all public utilities against competition by new public utilities without adequate proof and findings that public convenience and necessity required a new facility or expanded new service. The court concluded that the decision violated no constitutional right of the company because its service was affected with a wide public interest and was required to conform to the Public Utilities Law of the State of Colorado. The court concluded that its decision neither overlooked nor misapprehended any points. The court concluded that its determinations applied to both petitions.</SPAN></P>

The owners filed an action challenging the constitutionality of the order. The owners appealed after the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), held that &sect; 612.9-2(1) was constitutional as applied to them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners' property was zoned as a &quot;B-4&quot; district. They jointly owned a corporation that operated a retail trading business from the property; it was the custom of the corporation, which leased the property, to display its merchandise outside, in an area directly in front of its store. The Administrator issued a cease and desist order, finding that the outside display of merchandise violated Denver, Colo., Zoning Ordinance &sect;&sect; 612.9-2(1), 612.9-3(1). The owners sought judicial review, unsuccessfully asserting in the trial court that the zoning ordinances were arbitrary and discriminatory and were unconstitutional as applied to them. In reversing, the court noted that Denver, Colo., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 612.9-3(1) exempted filing stations and garden supply stores. The owners' store sold the same types of goods sold in those exempted types of businesses. The enforcement of the ordinances would result in an arbitrary and unconstitutional discrimination against the owners in favor of others engaged in handling the same or similar merchandise. The exclusion of the owners' business from those exempted under &sect; 612.9-3(1) was unreasonable and arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause with directions that the trial court should declare the zoning ordinances invalid as applied to the owners' store.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The electric co-op applied for a certificate which would permit the co-op to construct and finance an electric generating plant and associated transmission lines and related facilities necessary to deliver power to certain new customers it sought to serve at wholesale.

On appeal, the court reversed and held that: (1) the generating capabilities of existing electric suppliers in the state of Colorado were more than adequate to supply increased electrical needs without the additional plant; (2) affirmance of the district court's judgment and the decisions of the commission would have sanctioned duplication of existing electric facilities, which were adequate to supply the needs of the public; (3) regulation of the co-op did not violate either the Constitution of the State of Colorado or the Constitution of the United States; and (4) the fact that the plant had been constructed did not defeat the doctrine of regulated monopoly to which Colorado subscribed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-6-1 (Supp. 1960). Defendant appealed and asserted that his pretrial motion to suppress evidence should have been granted because the evidence was seized in an illegal, warrantless search.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer received a tip from a reliable informant that defendant had marijuana in his possession; the informer pointed defendant out to the officer. The officer began to question defendant and then searched his person. He seized a brown package after it dropped from defendant's hands; it contained marijuana cigarettes. Defendant filed a suppression motion, unsuccessfully arguing that the search violated his Fourth Amendment rights. Defendant reasserted his claim on appeal; he also argued that &sect; 48-6-1 unconstitutionally delegated authority to the Colorado State Board of Health to declare which drugs were prohibited. In affirming, the court held that the trial court properly concluded that the search was legal because it was made incident to a lawful arrest. It was not significant that the search preceded defendant's formal arrest; the officer could search defendant and his immediate vicinity once he had probable cause to make a warrantless arrest. Defendant could not challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 48-6-1 because he was not accused of any conduct that was unlawful by reason of the Board's actions; marijuana was specifically criminalized by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Ordinance made it unlawful for any person to engage in certain specified businesses, professions or occupations within Central City without first paying the clerk of Central City a license fee and obtaining from him a receipt or license setting forth that the fee had been paid. The owners were cited for violating the ordinance and the City obtained judgments against them. The owners appealed in the couty court. The City's complaints were dismissed on the grounds the Ordinance was unconstitutional and invalid. On review, the court reversed the judgment. The court held that the City's charter gave it power to license and tax divers businesses, and thus the City's occupational tax for the owners' businesses, which included a tavern, a snack bar and hamburger emporium, and a restaurant, and a tour service, were valid because the charter was broad enough to authorize taxes against those businesses. However, the court held that the City's effort to impose an additional occupational tax on the tourism business based on the owner's sale of curios was invalid as being discriminatory in the extreme; thus, Central, Colo., Ordinance 33, &sect;&sect; E, F, which authorized that tax, was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment, except to the extent that it invalidated two sections of the ordinance that authorized the taxing of one owner's curio business and another owner's rooming house.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed the judgment of the District Court of El Paso County (Colorado) that was rendered in favor of defendant Board of County Commissioners in the taxpayer's protest of the assessment of its merchandise inventory and its furniture and fixtures. The taxpayer had prayed that the assessment be declared void and improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal of the trial court's finding that the assessment was in all respects lawful, the taxpayer argued that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 137-2-24 and 137-2-25 (1963) provided the exclusive manner by which merchandise inventory could be assessed and that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137-2-3 (1963), providing for the assessment of property brought into the State after the statutory assessment date, was inapplicable. Further, the taxpayer claimed that the counties' varying and independent enforcement of &sect; 137-2-3 was arbitrary and in violation of the constitutional requirement of uniformity. In affirming the judgment below, the court found that &sect; 137-2-3 governed the cause inasmuch as it related to the manner in which the merchandise of a taxpayer who was engaged, as was the taxpayer, in the business of merchandising should be assessed. Further, careful analysis of &sect;&sect; 137-2-24, 137-2-25, and 137-2-3 convinced the court that the county assessor did not err in his assessment and that such assessment should be upheld. Moreover, the United States Supreme Court had ruled that taxpayers were not exempt from paying their taxes due to the failure of officials to exact the taxes from other owing taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landowners had sought review of a decision of the District Court, Seventeenth Judicial District (Colorado), which found for defendants, a water and sanitation district and others, in an action brought by the landowners to obtain an order excluding them from the district. The court had previously entered an opinion. The matter was before the court on rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners argued that they should be excluded from the district because their property would receive no special benefit from inclusion. They also asserted that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89-5-7 (2) (1963) was constitutionally defective. The trial court ruled that special benefit to the individual property was not the criterion, found that a water and sanitation district was created for the benefit of the entire community comprising the district, and rejected the argument of unconstitutionality. In affirming the decision, the could held that the determination of the trial court was correct. A water and sanitation district did not depend on special assessments for its revenue or taxing authority. Under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89-5-14 (1963), the power and authority to levy and collect ad valorem taxes was conferred upon the board. The court rejected the landowners' argument that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89-5-7 (2) (1963) was unconstitutional. The court expressly overruled Colo. Interstate Gas Co. v. Sable Water Dist., 152 Colo. 89, 380 P.2d 569 to the extent that the dictum appeared to say that benefit or lack thereof was the test for determination of inclusion or exclusion from a water district.</SPAN></P>
