</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the court's original jurisdiction, petitioner college and university faculty and respondents, commonwealth and Secretary of Education, filed cross motions for summary judgment to determine whether an arbitration award was enforceable against respondents or merely advisory, awaiting the appropriation of funds from the legislature. The Public Employee Relations Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 1101.804, stated that parties submitted to binding arbitration were bound by the award, but that decisions that required legislative enactment to be valid were considered advisory only. The court found that an award did not become advisory until the public employer had demonstrated that the legislature had met, considered, and expressly rejected an arbitration award. Respondents' citation to a recent appropriations act that had denied funds for negotiated compensation increases was not a legislative rejection of an arbitration award. The court distinguished an arbitrated compensation increase from a negotiated increase. The court confirmed the award.</SPAN></P>

Under the Public Employee Relations Act, an award did not become advisory until the legislature met, considered, and expressly rejected to fund the arbitration award. The award was not rejected by an appropriations bill that banned the use of funds for negotiated salary increases, not arbitration awards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a motor vehicle manufacturer, challenged an order of respondent State Board of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, Dealers, and Salesmen (Pennsylvania), which suspended petitioner's license when petitioner terminated the franchise of respondent a motor vehicle dealer without giving 60 days advance notice as required by &sect; 4(2)(xi) of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturer's, Dealer's, and Salesmen's License Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 63, &sect; 805(2)(xi).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent State Board of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, Dealers, and Salesmen (board) ordered the suspension of the license of petitioner, a motor vehicle manufacturer, after petitioner terminated the franchise of respondent motor vehicle dealer (dealer). Section 4(2)(xi) of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturer's, Dealer's, and Salesmen's License Act (Act), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 63, &sect; 805(2)(xi), required that franchised dealers receive 60 days notice before the termination of a franchise. Petitioner argued that the statute was not applicable because the parties did not have a written franchise agreement, but that if it was, a letter sent to respondent dealer nine months before the termination complied with the notice requirement. The court noted that a written agreement was not necessary to impose the requirements of the Act; instead, it looked to the business relationship of the parties and found a franchise existed. The letter placed respondent dealer &quot;on probation&quot; for a number of reasons and warned respondent dealer to make changes, but did not comply with the 60 day notice requirement of the Act. Respondent board's suspension of petitioner's license was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Although they did not have a written franchise agreement, the business relationship between petitioner and respondent motor vehicle dealer (dealer) indicated that a franchise existed, and petitioner's only letter to respondent dealer was not a notice of termination.</SPAN></P>

The court initially denied petitioner's motion, and petitioner filed a motion for reargument and filed a new stipulation which established that he had been a member of the State Employees' Retirement Fund for a period of 16 years prior to October 7, 1975. The court again denied petitioner's summary judgment motion, and entered judgment for respondent retirement board. The court found that &sect; 5953 did not unconstitutionally impair petitioner's retirement contract. The court found that the state could exercise such powers as were necessary for the general good of the public, though contracts previously entered into between individuals might be negatively affected by the state's actions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law Act (UTPCPL), 73 P.S. &sect; 201-1 et seq. particularly 73 P.S. &sect; 201-3, empowered respondent attorney general to reasonably define and establish by regulation unfair or deceptive acts or practices or unfair method of competition in addition to those expressly defined in 73 P.S. &sect; 201-2(4). The court held that respondent attorney general could delegate this power to the Bureau of Consumer Protection as a part of the Department of Justice pursuant to 73 P.S. &sect; 201-3.1. The court overruled respondent's demurrer, holding that debt collection was a trade or commerce within the meaning of the UTPCPL and the facts would determine whether compliance with particular regulations was so expensive that petitioners' property interest in their accounts had been taken.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County (Pennsylvania), which affirmed the determination of the municipal zoning hearing board to deny appellant's challenge to the validity of an ordinance that rezoned appellant's property, preventing the development of the property into mobile home courts. Appellant claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the trial court's order affirming municipal zoning hearing board's (board) denial of appellant's challenge to the validity of an ordinance rezoning appellant's property. On appeal, appellant claimed that improper procedures were followed in the adoption of the ordinance and that the ordinance was unconstitutional in that it constituted a de facto exclusion of mobile home parks and it was arbitrary, unreasonable, and confiscatory in application because it was directed at appellant's property. The court affirmed the lower court's order, finding no abuse of discretion or error of law by the board. The court determined that the amount of land available for mobile home park use did not indicate a de facto exclusion, and concluded that the ordinance in question was not exclusionary in effect. The court held that the prior owners of appellant's property did not preserve for review the issue of the propriety of procedures in enactment of the ordinance. Finally, the court found that there was no evidence of discriminatory special legislation directed at appellant and that the rezoning bore a substantial relationship to the general welfare of the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A clerk of the district justice filed a grievance for her discharge from her employment. Respondent employees union adopted her cause, charging petitioner judges of the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County with violations of the Public Employee Relations Act (PERA) and seeking to have the grievance heard by the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board. Under the court's original jurisdiction, petitioners filed a motion for summary relief, asking for the board to be enjoined from reviewing the claim of unfair labor practices. The court granted the injunction, finding that to allow the board's review would violate the doctrine of separation of powers. Because the court was responsible for all aspects of its employees, the only proper forum for review of employee grievances was within the judicial branch of government. Although the court found that PERA granted some rights to judicial employees, it did not immunize such employees from the inherent judicial power of discharge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board could not exercise jurisdiction over the underlying employee discharge matter brought by respondent employees union.

Petitioner attorney, counsel for certain municipal officers and the like, filed a petition for review seeking injunctive and declaratory relief from this requirement which respondent declared applied to municipal solicitors like petitioner.

Respondent commission filed a demurrer. Agreeing with petitioner, the court overruled the preliminary objections of respondent commission and directed the commission to file an answer to petitioner's action within 30 days.

Petitioner did not report them lost but requested a hearing in May 1979 to determine if he was entitled to a replacement. Under a new law effective March 1979, the deduction for high medical expenses was replaced with a standard deduction. Petitioner was found to be ineligible as a result of this change in the law. The court agreed with an administrative finding that because petitioner did not report that the ATP was lost until May 1979, he was not entitled to a replacement.

Petitioners also requested the court to enjoin respondent Department of Revenue (Department) from assessing taxes against petitioners. The department filed preliminary objections challenging the subject matter jurisdiction of the court because the exclusive jurisdiction of the matter lied within the department's administrative tribunals. The court agreed with the department. The tax code provided an appeal procedure for petitioners to challenge sales and personal income tax assessments through the department's Board of Appeals and Finance and Revenue. Thus, the initial phases of tax assessment appeals were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the department's boards. Petitioners' constitutional challenge to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 7339 was not one that went to the basic validity of the tax statute. Instead, petitioners alleged certain procedural defects in the statute which administrative tribunals were competent to adjudicate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff media subject filed a complaint that alleged defamation, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress against defendants, commonwealth, Departments of Revenue and Justice, former Secretary of Revenue, and two media companies, in regard to a letter that was transferred from defendants, commonwealth entities and officer, to defendant newspaper company that, in turn, published it. Defendants, commonwealth entities and officer, filed preliminary objections in the nature of claim of absolute immunity and demurrers. The preliminary objections of absolute immunity were overruled of defendant officer due to his position as a commonwealth officer because no party's pleading addressed whether public policy was or was not served by release of the letter to the press. Defendant commonwealth entities' preliminary objections were sustained as plaintiff's complaint failed to allege a cause of action within any of the eight exceptions to the bar of sovereign immunity provided by 42 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that an &quot;actual controversy&quot; existed so as to justify its consideration of the declaratory judgment requested by petitioner, the attorney who headed the Office of Consumer Advocate, as to the constitutional validity of Pa. Code of Professional Responsibility DR 7-107(H), which limited the right of lawyers during the pendency of administrative proceedings to make certain public statements. Explaining, the court acknowledged the conflict that existed between petitioner's free speech rights and the threat he received of disciplinary action. These rights could be restricted when necessary to ensure the due process rights of parties involved in proceedings in which petitioner was acting as counsel, the court said. Rejecting an assertion of overbroadness, the court ruled that the rule's limitation on comments &quot;reasonably likely&quot; to interfere with public hearings was properly restricted in time and person to ensure fairness. Nor was the proscription on out-of-court statements &quot;on any other matter&quot; affecting a hearing's fairness impermissibly vague, because when read in context with other barred conduct petitioner was placed on notice of statements viewed as prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

A prisoner was not entitled to a hearing prior to transfer unless such transfer was punitive in nature and for disciplinary reasons. Because petitioner did not allege those factors, he failed to state a claim on the transfer issue. Due process was satisfied in prison disciplinary proceedings when the inmate was afforded written notice of the violation charged in advance of the hearing, a written statement by the factfinders to the evidence relied on, and the right to call witnesses on his own behalf. Because petitioner did not aver that he was denied those safeguards, due process was not violated. A decision by a prison tribunal was not a final adjudication within the court's jurisdiction absent an allegation that the action was arbitrarily or capriciously imposed and, because that was not alleged, the petition for review was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Taxpayers, owners of real estate, objected to the assessments imposed by the Board of Revision of Taxes. The taxpayers and the board proposed different methods for determining the proper ratio of assessed value to market value of properties. The trial court accepted the method proposed by the board, subject to some modifications. This method involved determining the actual ratio between assessed and fair market values by breaking the properties into six land use categories and then computing various ratios. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the novel method of calculation adopted by the trial court was too complex to be accepted by other than the most sophisticated property owners. Further, the methodology deviated substantially from the common and accepted methodology. The court ruled the trial court's exercise of equity jurisdiction was improper because the statutorily provided remedies had not been shown to be inadequate and no constitutional question had been demonstrated, as provided by 72 P.S. &sect; 5341.1 et seq. The court thus reversed the trial court's order and remanded the matter for a determination of the appropriate ratios.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner later pled guilty to various crimes and the Senate found that $ 30,232 in Senate funds had been wrongfully spent by petitioner during his tenure by hiring &quot;ghost&quot; employees. The Senate directed respondent State Employees' Retirement Board under 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5953 (1975) to setoff the funds necessary to reimburse the commonwealth from the retirement benefits being paid to petitioner. The board complied and petitioner brought an action for declaratory judgment and a writ of mandamus, filing a motion for summary judgment. The court denied petitioner's motion, finding that petitioner had not qualified for retirement benefits before 1975 and was therefore subject to the setoff provisions of &sect; 5953. The court further found that the procedures used to initiate the setoff complied with due process when balancing petitioner's interests against the commonwealth's need to conserve its fiscal and administrative resources. Finally, the court entered judgment in favor of respondent, although it had not moved for judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the fact of the option given domestic corporations to calculate their capital stock tax by the three-factor method and that different rates of the same tax could not be imposed on domestic and foreign corporations, was not unconstitutional.

The court held that appellees were policemen within the meaning of Act 111 and that mandamus was the proper remedy to compel bargaining where their right to bargaining was clear. Finally, the court concluded that appellant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of Act 111 because the statute only affected the rights of policemen and firemen, not their public employer.</SPAN></P>

The court held that mandamus was the proper remedy to compel bargaining where appellees' right to bargaining was clear, and that appellant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of statutory provisions concerning the rights of its employees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of violating the Lycoming County, Pa., Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance and ordered that he pay a $ 650 fine and the costs of prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Lycoming County, Pa., Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance prohibited the sale of land before a final plat was approved by the county. Before the approval of a final plat, defendant sold several acres of land to a corporation, and he was subsequently convicted of violating the ordinance. On appeal, defendant claimed that because he did not subdivide his land with reference to or by other use of a plat, he did not violate the ordinance. He also alleged that the ordinance was an unconstitutional restraint on his freedom to use his land, and that his right to a speedy trial was denied. The court affirmed, holding that the ordinance applied to defendant's conduct, as it not only prohibited subdividing land &quot;with reference to a plat&quot; but contained the all-inclusive words &quot;or otherwise.&quot; The court found that the ordinance was a reasonable exercise of the government's police power to ensure that land was not developed in a way adverse to the environment or the public. The court found no speedy trial violation, as defendant's case was called and a jury selected within the 180-day period.</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellee was required to use a scientific test, if one was available. However, appellee showed that no accepted scientific test existed for measuring emissions from an open area. The court also found sufficient subjective evidence there were discharges of dust that could have been avoided. On appellant's challenge that the statute was unconstitutionally vague, the court held that the specific enumeration of contaminants in the statute was sufficient to put appellant on notice that its actions caused air pollution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's order upholding appellee township's refusal to adopt the curative amendment overturning its 10-acre-minimum one-family lot size proposed by appellant landowner, who sought to subdivide his tract. It agreed with the lower court that appellant had not shown that the 10-acre minimum excluded any portion of the population entirely from the township, noting that the minimum applied to only a third of the township's area and that the other residential districts were subject to a one-acre lot area minimum. It found, however, that the minimum requirement did not have the required substantial relationship to the public welfare and therefore had an unduly restrictive impact, rejecting appellee's argument that the minimum was necessary to avoid pollution caused by on-site septic systems. Noting that previous cases had struck down requirements of two, three, or four acres, it concluded that as a means to protect the public interest, the 10-acre minimum here was no more reasonable than these.</SPAN></P>

Further, the home office expenses were not deductible because although petitioner's work for the union required a suitable working area, the union did not recognize that petitioner would incur any expenses in the pursuit of his union chores.

First, the court rejected appellant's assertion that &sect; 65702 imposed a 10-year limitation upon the power of appellee's supervisors to assess properties for the cost and expense of maintaining lights. The court held that the statute imposed no limitation on the number of successive 10-year contracts which may have been entered into, nor did it remotely suggest that there was a 10-year or any other limitation on the time during which properties should have been assessed for the continuing expense of the maintenance of lights. Second, appellant asserted that the supervisors did not make a consistent application of assessments. The court held that appellant's averments of her amended complaint fell far short of showing a deliberate, purposeful discrimination in the administration of light assessments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee challenged the action of respondent State Employee's Retirement Board (Pennsylvania), when it discontinued petitioner's pension benefits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee had qualified for, and was receiving, state pension benefits when he entered a plea of nolo contendere and was convicted in the federal district court of four counts of federal extortion under 18 U.S.C.

The proceedings before the court attacked that action and the law on which it was based. Respondent's order was reversed and the matter was remanded with a direction that all pension benefits be restored retroactively. The court determined that respondent's order was an adjudication in that it was a final order by an agency that affected personal or property rights, duties, liabilities, or obligations of the parties, so that an appeal was available under 2 Pa.

The court found that the Act was an unconstitutional impairment of obligation of contract because petitioner's pension benefits vested prior to the enactment of the statute and the crime committed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the legislature's authorization of suspension or revocation following disciplinary action taken by another state against a holder of a Pennsylvania license was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary and constituted a valid exercise of the state's police power.

The court found the standards for approval in &sect; 6(d) to be not so vague as to render them unconstitutional because appellees could inquire to determine the competency of a potential inspector. The ordinance was sufficiently specific to prevent appellees from exercising their power in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner by following &sect; 6(d). The trial court correctly refused to issue mandamus because the record contained substantial evidence of appellant making improper inspections and reports for appellees to correctly refuse to approve appellant as an inspector. The trial court correctly declined to be bound by appellees' letter denying appellant's application because the evidence was legally sufficient to support appellees' decision. The court declined to address the constitutionality of &sect; 3(b) because this inquiry was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that dismissed appellant corporation's complaint against appellee township, which sought equitable relief from the ordinance because it was unconstitutional and that requested a writ of mandamus requiring the approval of appellees, township and board of supervisors, of appellant as an electrical inspector. The ordinance was constitutional. The trial court's denial of mandamus was based on substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the Insurance Company Law, 40 Pa. Cons.

That section gave respondent the authority to revoke a license of a physician who lost a license in another state. The appellate court affirmed. The court held that respondent could revoke a license on the basis of actions which occurred in another state. There was no evidence that petitioner committed acts of malpractice or violated any rules in Pennsylvania. However, a physician in Pennsylvania was under a duty to remain in good standing in another state where he was licensed in that state.

Sixty-two P.S. &sect; 432.12(a) of the Public Welfare Code and 55 Pa. Code, &sect; 183.64(e)(1) were adopted which required that respondent Department of Public Welfare reduce from income expenses of up to only $ 25 in determining eligibility for aid. The effect of this was that petitioner could no longer deduct the expenses of employing someone to care for his sick wife in determining their eligibility. The hearing examiner affirmed the discontinuance of aid, and respondent affirmed. The appellate court reversed and remanded. Government had the authority to discontinue welfare benefits, but it could not do so in an arbitrary fashion. The record was unclear as to why a limit was placed at $ 25. The cause would have to be remanded for a determination on the relationship between the legitimate governmental interest to the limitation.

Further, petitioner's arguments failed to meet the heavy burden of showing that 61 P.S. &sect; 331.4, which authorized a majority of respondent's board to revoke the parole of any person, violated the constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state liquor control board challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Adams County (Pennsylvania), which directed that liquor purchased by appellee owner in Maryland and transported into Pennsylvania that appellant sought to forfeit pursuant to 47 P.S. &sect;&sect; 6-601 to -603 be returned to appellee upon payment of Pennsylvania taxes or, if taxes were not paid, be forfeited.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state liquor control board seized two cases of liquor purchased by appellee owner in Maryland and brought into Pennsylvania in violation of 47 P.S. &sect; 4-491(2). After a hearing, the lower court ordered that the liquor be returned to appellee upon payment of Pennsylvania taxes, but be forfeited to appellant if the taxes were not paid. On appeal, the court reversed, and held that the portion of the liquor code which was found unconstitutional by the lower court in a prior ruling was severable, such that the remainder of &sect; 4-491(2) was valid and enforceable for purposes of the forfeiture proceeding. Thus, if appellant proved that the liquor in question was possessed in violation of &sect; 4-491(2), the court below erred in when it ordered its return to the owner. As the record convincingly demonstrated unlawful possession, &sect; 4-491(2) clearly was violated and the liquor, therefore, was unlawfully possessed and was subject to forfeiture.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's order that required return of liquor to appellee owner, subject to forfeiture to appellant state liquor control board if taxes on it were not paid because the findings showed that the liquor code was clearly violated by appellee's transport of the liquor into Pennsylvania. The matter was remanded for the entry of an order providing for the forfeiture of the liquor to appellant.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner contended that he was not required to pay the taxes because the federal social security system was unconstitutional and adverse to biblical law. The court affirmed and held that respondent properly disallowed certain deductions petitioner claimed because they either did not have supporting data or were not related to a business or occupation for which petitioner claimed them. The court found that petitioner did not produce evidence controverting respondent's position and held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear his claims regarding the constitutionality of the federal social security system as it applied to the validity of his tax assessment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order upholding respondent state's tax assessment against petitioner taxpayer because respondent's uncontroverted evidence showed that the identified deductions claimed by petitioner lacked supporting data or were not related to a business or occupation for which they were claimed.

The court held that the act did not impair a contractual obligation or disturb a vested right of the parties and therefore it was not unconstitutional on those grounds. The court found that the act did not violate the ex post facto provision of Pa. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parent filed a complaint in trespass which alleged that defendants, Commonwealth, the board of probation and parole (board), and individual members of the board, were negligent in the release of a convicted felon, who, after his release, raped and murdered plaintiff's minor daughter. The court sustained the preliminary objections of defendants, Commonwealth and board, and dismissed plaintiff's complaint as to them on the ground of sovereign immunity. The doctrine applied to bar plaintiffs suit at the time the circumstances giving rise to the action occurred, and still barred the action when instituted. The subsequent passage of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5110(a), which set forth an applicable exception to the sovereign immunity doctrine, did not change this result. However, the preliminary objections of defendant individual members of the board, which asserted absolute immunity, were overruled and dismissed without prejudice to raise the defense of official immunity. The rules of absolute immunity had been judicially replaced by the doctrine of official immunity. The passage of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5110 did not affect the operation official immunity.</SPAN></P>

The doctrine of sovereign immunity still served as a defense to plaintiff's action despite the recent passage of an applicable statutory exclusion because the circumstances giving rise to plaintiff's claim, and the initiation of the action, occurred before the effective date of the exception.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two consolidated appeals were before the court. One involving the trial court's refusal in a mandamus action to compel the issuance of a grading permit for an airport extension, and the other concerning an order granting applicant approval of that same airport enlargement in a statutory zoning proceeding.

Appellee township supervisors denied the curative amendment, but its resolution purported to grant a variance. The court held that 53 P.S. &sect;&sect; 10603, 10912 conferred the variance power exclusively upon the zoning hearing board and affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the mandamus complaint because the township supervisors lacked authority to grant the variance purported by their resolution. The court then reversed the trial court's order as to the zoning appeal that still remained and remanded with the direction it be denied holding that in a residential township, zoning provisions permitting airports could be omitted without placing upon the municipality the burden of demonstrating a justification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayers sought review of an order of the Pennsylvania Board of Finances and Revenue, which sustained respondent Pennsylvania Department of Revenue's assessment against petitioners but which declined to rule on a challenge to the constitutionality of 72 P.S. &sect; 7314(a) (1971).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under 72 P.S. &sect; 7314 (a) (1971), Pennsylvania taxpayers receive a credit for income taxes paid to another state. Petitioner taxpayers argued that the provision violated Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, which provided that all taxes had to be uniform. Petitioners argued that to grant taxpayers credits against Pennsylvania personal income tax for taxes paid to other states, while denying credits for taxes paid to local Pennsylvania taxing authorities, created unequal state tax burdens. The court affirmed and noted that taxpayers bore a heavy burden when contesting the constitutionality of a taxation statute and that the legislature had broad discretion in choosing acceptable classifications. The court asserted that it had no authority to rewrite the statutes as proposed by petitioners. The court concluded that when petitioners questioned the reasonableness of the scheme, they were questioning not uniformity of the taxing provisions, but rather the sense of fairness, which permitted the imposition of two separate and distinct taxes on one income. The court held that two separate taxing schemes that superimposed one upon the other did not create impermissible, unconstitutional inequalities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the Pennsylvania Board of Finances and Revenue, which sustained a tax assessment against petitioner taxpayers. The court held that the tax statute that permitted Pennsylvania taxpayers a credit for taxes paid to other states but not to local jurisdictions was constitutional because it did not constitute non-uniform taxation. The court entered a judgment against petitioners for the amount of taxes owed.</SPAN></P>

The court sustained the objections and held that the Act did not deny petitioners due process or equal protection of the law, did not infringe on petitioners' rights to serve in public office, was not vague or overbroad, did not infringe on petitioners' rights of privacy and freedom from unreasonable searches, and did not provide for an unconstitutional exercise of the power of appointment. Furthermore, the Act did not violate Pa. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner private schools were approved for special education tuition reimbursement. They alleged that the Secretary of Education erred in allowing respondent Department of Education to pay monies owning to petitioners to be paid on a pro rata basis. Specifically, petitioners claimed they had been denied due process of law in that the criteria set forth in 22 Pa. Code &sect; 171.19(e)(2) were too indefinite to provide a guide as to what charges were reimbursable. The court found that the criteria provided sufficient guidance for conducting audits and taking subsequent administrative actions regarding reasonable costs. Petitioners then argued that respondent was precluded from applying the reimbursement regulations retroactively. The court disagreed, reasoning that reimbursement for tuition rates was deemed conditional, not vested, so that new tuition rates could not have been fixed by any pre-school year contractual agreement. Finally, since the General Assembly allocated specific funds from which payments were to be made to the approved private schools, the Department of Education was powerless to use funds appropriated for other purposes to satisfy its debts to Petitioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Secretary of Education's adjudication, concluding that the statutory language provided a general description of a certain type of fund to be used rather than a command that special education appropriations were to be used for reimbursement, and that having previously concluded that a pro rata disbursement was an acceptable method, respondent Department of Education properly applied the audit regulations retroactively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff deputy sheriff was hired in 1960. In 1972, the county set up a retirement system under 16 P.S. &sect; 11651, et seq., pursuant to which plaintiff was forced into retirement in 1973. In 1975, an amending resolution allowed retired deputies to work a yearly maximum of 30 days, payable on a per diem basis.

Plaintiff filed suit to recover for days worked but not paid in 1975 and 1976, and the jury returned a verdict in his favor. Defendant commissioners appealed.

In addition, respondent ordered that the maps filed show only distribution lines located on the peripheries of service territories, where electric utilities adjoined other electric utilities, where electric utilities adjoined electric cooperative corporations, and where electric cooperative corporations adjoined other electric cooperatives. An administrative law judge affirmed the order nisi. Petitioner objected to the requirement that the maps show distribution lines where two public electric utilities adjoined. The court affirmed the lower tribunal's order. The court found that petitioner was attempting to have the court render an advisory opinion on the meaning and constitutionality of the statutory provisions. The court would not do so. The court stated that both parties ignored the clear mandate that all distribution lines be shown, regardless of their location.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review of an order denying appellant utility company relief, appellant utility company contended that appellee township's fees for the installation and maintenance of gas pipes located under township's roads were invalid because they were not based on the township's actual cost of processing the application and inspecting the work but rather on the cost of similar services provided by appellee Department of Transportation. The court disagreed and affirmed the order. First, the township had no discretion to fix the permit fees because pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 66156 the prescribed fees were determined by the department. Second, &sect; 66156 did not prohibit the department from using its own cost studies and fee schedule in determining the fees to be charged by the township and, there were substantial similarities between the department and township procedures and salary schedules. And finally, the trial court did not err in determining that the fees were not excessive because even though the evidence was conflicting, there was testimony that warranted the trial court's findings.</SPAN></P>

The classification excluding parents of employers from unemployment compensation coverage was rationally related to a legitimate state interest.

The denial was based upon the finding of respondent Unemployment Compensation Board that he voluntarily terminated his employment because of domestic obligations and circumstances.

Petitioner sought determination of the vitality and constitutionality of Section 205 of the Magisterial District Reform Act, 42 P.S. &sect; 2205, to compel respondent court administrators to register him as a &quot;qualified retired district justice&quot; under the provisions of &sect; 205.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

Respondents contended that &sect; 205 was repealed and replaced by the Judicial Code, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4122, which respondents challenged as unconstitutional under Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(c). The court held that the legislature intended to repeal absolutely all of the provisions of 42 P.S. &sect; 2205, except for the compensation clause thereof, which remained in effect until a separate repealer date. The court also held that the applicable provisions governing assignment of senior district justices were those found in the Judicial Code, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4122(b). Because no registration procedure was established therein, petitioner's request for injunctive relief was denied. Next, the court held that Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 16, being silent regarding senior district justices, did not constitute a positive prohibition upon the power of the legislature to enact laws providing for their assignment. Thus, the legislature had the power to enact the provision.</SPAN></P>

After considering the constitutionality of both those requirements, the trial court held that they were valid and refused to grant appellant relief. Appellant claimed compliance with the price requirement but, on appeal, pursued a constitutional attack upon the second class mail requirement.

Petitioners challenged the order, which was denied by respondent Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board (board). The appellate court affirmed. The court rejected the argument that since 77 P.S. &sect; 991 required respondent board to establish certain rules for departmental hearings, and because it had not established such rules, the hearing could not be held. Respondent department had the authority to impose penalties under &sect; 991. Ceilings of 10 and 20% percent for penalties were a sufficient standard to meet petitioners' due process rights. The statute did not violate Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 18's requirement that workmen's compensation be reasonable. The fact that employers and insurers could be penalized as much as 20 percent whereas claimants could only lose interest for causing delay was not a denial of equal protection.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school district sought review of the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County (Pennsylvania), which ordered appellant to pay to appellee elected tax collector commissions on certain returns for delinquent taxes which were subsequently collected by appellee county because the returns in question were made under 72 P.S. &sect; 5971 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ordered appellant school district to pay to appellee elected tax official commissions on returns for delinquent taxes which were subsequently collected by appellee county. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of appellee elected tax official but reversed regarding appellee county. The court held that appellee elected tax official was entitled to the commissions because the returns in question were made under 72 P.S. &sect; 5971a et seq. (1931) and appellee elected tax official had an unambiguously vested right in the commissions. However, the court held that appellee county was liable for their payment and appellant was not. The court determined that the statutory provisions in effect when the collections were made had to have been used because the action payment of the commissions were part of and dependent upon the collection process as governed by the Real Estate Tax Sale Law, 72 P.S. &sect; 5860.101 et seq. (1947). The Real Estate Tax Sale Law had a catch-all section which established non-reimbursable and non-recoverable county liability and therefore the commissions should have been paid out as other expenses of appellee county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order in favor of appellee county and affirmed the judgment in favor of appellee elected tax collector in the action on commissions on certain returns for delinquent taxes. The court held that appellee elected tax collector was entitled to the commissions but that appellee county was liable instead of appellant school district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, two members of a drug rehabilitation program, were turned down when they applied to appellee, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare, for food stamps. To fund the drug program, various counties contributed a per capita sum, called vendor payments, which appellee assessed as income. For the purposes of food stamp eligibility, appellee concluded that appellants' income exceeded the eligibility requirements of the Food Stamp Act of 1964, 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2011 et seq. Although the federal vendor payment provision had been held void, the court found that the commonwealth's vendor-payment regulation was not invalid. Nor did the payments fall within the exemption for medical benefits, absent an accounting that could show what amount of the per capita payment was used for medical purposes. Finally, although the vendor payments were considered income and block grant funds were not, this discrepancy did not violate the equal protection clause when there was a reasonable basis for it. The court affirmed the order to deny benefits.</SPAN></P>

Lower Merion Township, Pa., Ordinance 1769 prohibited the sale of merchandise, including food, from motor vehicles.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an ice cream truck business, were prohibited from operating when appellees, Lower Merion Township, its Department of Police, and its Department of Health, enacted Lower Merion Township, Pa., Ordinance 1769, which banned the selling of food from motor vehicles parked in such a way as to induce purchasers to approach the seller. The ordinance was purportedly enacted to protect young children. The court, observing that local ordinances enjoyed the same presumption of constitutionality as statutes, noted that the First Class Township Code, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect;&sect; 56510, 56544, and 56552, gave appellees the authority to promulgate regulations under their exercise of the police power. However, the court also noted that police power was not absolute. In this case, appellees' regulation had put appellant out of business. Evidence in the record about appellant's required safety training for its drivers showed that appellant had dealt effectively with potential hazards raised by the business. The court reversed and permanently enjoined appellees from enforcing the ordinance, which was unreasonable and overbroad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant sought review of a decision by the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (Pennsylvania), which affirmed a referee's denial of benefits following petitioner's voluntary termination of her employment under 43 P.S. 802(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant was a nurse who quit work because she could not provide care for her two sons. Her petition for unemployment compensation was denied by the referee, pursuant to 43 P.S. &sect; 802. The denial was affirmed by respondent Unemployment Compensation Board of Review. On further review, petitioner contended that by preventing persons who quit their jobs for domestic reasons from showing that their resignations were motivated by necessitous and compelling causes, in comparison to persons who quit their jobs for any other reason, the statute established a classification which bore no rational relationship to a legitimate state interest, and therefore, violated the guarantee of equal protection. The court reversed the decision of respondent, and remanded the case for a redetermination of eligibility for benefits. The court held that the absolute disqualification of all unemployment compensation claimants who voluntarily terminated their employment for martial, filial, or domestic reasons had no rational relationship to a legitimate legislative purpose, and violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the Unemployment Compensation Board that disqualified appellant from unemployment benefits because she voluntarily resigned her employment because of domestic reasons was reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner parolee challenged a decision of respondent Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole (Board) and others, which had ordered his arrest and recommitment as a parole violator. Petitioner challenged his arrest and the crediting of detention and parole time to his sentences, and raised issues about the revocation hearing and his incarceration status. Respondent board filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was paroled from a previous sentence. Shortly thereafter he was questioned about two shooting deaths. When respondent parole board and others could not locate petitioner, he was arrested on a warrant and charged with a violation of the Uniform Firearms Act. He was thereafter confined in a restricted area of a state correctional institution. No credit was granted for street time while on parole, and detention time following arrest was applied to the previous sentence. In an original action, petitioner challenged his arrest, application of detention time, the revocation hearing process, and the conditions of his incarceration. Respondent filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer. The court sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the petition for review because it had no jurisdiction over the arrest issues inasmuch as they had previously been decided on a motion to suppress. The denial of street time under 61 P.S. &sect; 331.21a(a) was constitutional, and the application of detention time to the earlier sentence was proper. Petitioner had a timely revocation hearing and respondent had no responsibility for the conditions of petitioner's incarceration.</SPAN></P>

XIV. The court affirmed the order of dismissal, finding that substantial evidence on the record supported the board's decision to demote appellant and that the board reasonably exercised its discretion without any violation of due process. The court believed appellant was well aware of the basis for his demotion, considering that his supervisor informed him numerous times that his insubordinate, disruptive and disloyal conduct was in question, and it therefore, rejected appellant's contention that an unconstitutionally vague standard was applied.

On review, the court dismissed the objections, and held that that petitioner owner's association claim that the taxpayer status of its members has been affected by &sect; 7201(m) was sufficient to confer standing on the association under the Declaratory Judgments Act &sect; 2, 12 P.S. &sect; 832. The refund provisions of the code did not provide a sufficient statutory remedy such that a declaratory judgment should not be permitted. Because the parties, and possibly the issues, in other litigation challenging &sect; 7201(m) were not identical to the instant case, dismissal of petitioners' action was not required. Because petitioners merely sought a declaration that &sect; 7201(m) was unconstitutional, the action was not barred by sovereign immunity. Petitioners properly initiated the action by way of a petition for review pursuant to Pa. R. App. P. 1501(a)(3), 1502.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the preliminary objections of respondent, the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue, holding that petitioner owners' association had standing to challenge the constitutionality of a tax statute, based on the taxpayer status of its members. A declaratory judgment action was appropriate as disputed factual questions could be resolved in such an action, and sovereign immunity was not a bar to it.</SPAN></P>

The property had been sold to appellant at a treasurer's sale for the nonpayment of real estate taxes. The trial court had declared the tax sale void, on the basis that notice by certified mail was constitutionally inadequate under the circumstances and in violation of appellees' due process rights. The court reversed the order of the trial court and held that the notice required by due process was that which is reasonably calculated, under all of the circumstances, to actually apprise interested parties and afford them an opportunity to present their objections. Certified mail addressed to appellant at its actual place of residence was reasonably calculated to give actual notice of the proceedings to appellant. Appellant's signature was on the return receipt card, which gave the taxing authorities strong reason to believe that actual notice had in fact been received. Therefore, appellant had received proper notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Department of Banking determined that certain insurance premium financing contracts entered into by petitioner bank were direct loans that exceeded the lawful maximum interest rate and directed petitioner to rebate excessive interest charges. The bank invoked the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court under 17 P.S. &sect;&sect; 211.401 - 403 by filing a petition for review in the nature of a complaint in equity questioning a governmental determination. Respondent filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer for failure to state a cause of action, and alleged that it was immune from suit and that the petition failed to plead a justiciable issue. The court dismissed the preliminary objections because it held that sovereign immunity did not bar a suit seeking to restrain government officials from performing affirmative acts and that petitioner was not required to await judicial enforcement proceedings before seeking judicial review. The demurrer was overruled because on the state of the record the court could not say that the petition failed to state a cause of action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, environmental department, issued orders requiring appellants, land owners and occupiers, to take corrective measures as to the pollution of the waters of their land.

The court held that requiring appellants who had not caused the pollution to spend the sums necessary to abate the condition, based solely upon their ownership or occupancy of land, was employing means unduly oppressive upon these individuals. The court held that the board's conclusion that 35 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 691.316 was a declaration of the strict liability of appellants to correct the condition was erroneous as a matter of law because such a construction of &sect; 316 would permit the commonwealth to engage in regulation which constituted the taking of property without compensation, and hence, would be an unconstitutional exercise of police power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner education association filed a petition for interlocutory appeal from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County (Pennsylvania), which entered a decree enjoining a work stoppage by petitioner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner education association initiated a work stoppage and respondent school district sought relief from the trial court. The trial court entered a decree enjoining the work stoppage on grounds that it created a clear and present danger to the health, safety, or welfare of the public. Petitioner presented a motion to the trial court to amend the decree to provide a statement which allowed immediate appeal as required by 17 P.S. &sect; 211.501(b), which was denied by the trial court. Petitioner filed a petition for interlocutory appeal under the statute, however the court denied the petition because it was without authority because the trial court had refused to amend its decree. Petitioner also filed a petition for review of the trial court's denial. The court held that the trial court's denial was not so egregious as to warrant the court's entertainment of the petition for review. The court determined that since the trial court had declared that a portion of the statute was unconstitutional, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the matter under 17 P.S. &sect; 211.202(9). The court therefore transferred the matters to the supreme court.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners sought a decree enjoining and restraining respondents Pennsylvania Treasurer and Pennsylvania Secretary of Education from making payments of state funds to any other school districts. The court sustained respondents' preliminary objections and dismissed the action. The court held that there was no discrimination, invidious or otherwise, in a system that applied a uniform subsidy formula statewide, while at the same time adapting to community diversification by providing for local taxation. The court found that the state's subsidy formula, which weighed district density, poverty, number of students, cost per student, and district wealth, bore a facially fair and substantial relation to promoting equal educational opportunity.</SPAN></P>

Appellants, the board, joined by the Land Use Task Force and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Environmental Resources, sought review. The court affirmed and held that the zoning ordinance's exclusion of legitimate residential uses did not bear a substantial relationship to the protection of health, safety, and the general welfare. The advertisement of amendments to the comprehensive plan was insufficient public notice of an intention to rezone and did not prevent appellees from filing zoning appeals. The court found that appellees must be issued permits to build as they proposed because 53 P.S. &sect; 11004(2)(c) implied that grant of permits was the remedy in requests for curative amendments and landowners successful in challenging this type of zoning deserved definitive relief.</SPAN></P>

Const. Stat. &sect; 1003 et seq, against Commonwealth officials charged with administration and implementation of Act, and argued it violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and the Act's title violated Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs initiated a class action, which sought to enjoin implementation and enforcement of Pennsylvania No-fault Act (Act), 40 Pa. Const. Stat. &sect; 1003 et seq. Defendants sought dismissal on lack of standing and inappropriateness of a declaratory action. The court held that antagonistic claims clearly existed between the parties which would lead to imminent and inevitable litigation, and rights of plaintiff and class were sufficiently affected by provisions of the Act to provide standing. Declaratory Judgment Act could not be utilized to consider plaintiff's rights in anticipation of events, or for rendition of advisory opinions. The challenge as to U.S. Const. amend. XVI was meritless as the classification scheme was not arbitrary and was consistent with a stated objective, thus, constitutional. Classifications may be imperfect, but not unconstitutional, and incidental provisions of a statute needn't be enumerated in the title if they were germane to legislation as a whole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held the Pennsylvania No-fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, 40 Pa. Const. Stat. &sect; 1003 et seq, did not deny U.S. Const. amend. XVI, due process or equal protection and that its' title did not violate the Pennsylvania Constitution, defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings was therefore granted.</SPAN></P>

Appellants, city and intervenors, argued that the ordinance enjoyed a presumption of validity, and appellee failed to carry the burden of proving that the ordinance totally excluded apartment use. The court disagreed, holding that the presumption of validity is rebutted, as it was demonstrated that the ordinance entirely excluded a facially legitimate use. Moreover, the court declared that appellant city was required to establish that its regulation bore a relationship to the public health, safety, and welfare. The court found that appellant city failed to carry this burden. Appellants also argued that membership in a regional planning effort cured the otherwise unconstitutional nature of the ordinance.

The court remanded for a new hearing, because it found sufficient indications to warrant a conclusion that appellant was denied a fair trial. Specifically, the prosecutor who provided pre-hearing legal advice to the board also served as the prosecuting attorney, provided legal advice to the hearing body, and drafted and reviewed the final adjudication and order. Although the exigencies of modern corporate government required that one entity within a particular agency make the decision to prosecute, and another to sit as adjudicator, the same attorney could not both prosecute the case and draft the adjudication and order in which he took it upon himself to amend and supplement certain findings. The prosecutor's actions created a sufficient appearance of impropriety as to warrant a denial of due process.

On appeal, the court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment, holding that petitioner possessed no right to credit for time spent on parole while in violation of the conditions of his parole.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sought review from two orders entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County (Pennsylvania). In one order, the lower court dismissed appellants' petition to set aside an arbitration award in favor of appellee township, and in the other, the lower court entered judgment in favor of appellee on appellants' de novo appeal from the arbitration award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When, after getting subdivision approval, appellant landowners breached an agreement with appellee township to improve certain land, appellee sued appellants for the cost of the improvements. The case was sent to arbitration, but appellants did not attend, and appellee was granted an award. Appellants sought review, and also filed a petition to set the award aside. The lower court dismissed the petition, ruling that the direct appeal rendered it superfluous. While appellants awaited review of the order dismissing the petition, the lower court proceeded to try the de novo appeal, and a verdict was returned for appellee. Appellants' post-trial motions were denied, and appellants again sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the lower court's order dismissing the petition was not appealable, and any review thereof was cut off by appellants' direct challenge to the award. The lower court rightly proceeded to try the case de novo, because no stay was obtained. The new matters appellants had raised for the first time on appeal, even if considered, lacked any merit, and appellants were legally bound either to complete the improvements or pay the cost thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment in favor of appellee township for costs incurred to complete improvements which appellant landowners had agreed to make as a condition of approval of their subdivision plat. The lower court was correct in dismissing appellants' petition to set aside the award, and in hearing the case de novo on appellants' demand for review, and the resulting verdict did not invade appellants' constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife, a homemaker, received a bill for occupation and per capita taxes levied by defendants borough, school district, and county pursuant to the authority granted by the Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. &sect; 6901 et seq., the Fourth to Eighth Class County Assessment Law, 53 P.S. &sect; 6901 et seq., and the Public School Code of 1949, 24 P.S. &sect; 6-601 et seq. After appellant husband was notified that his wages were being attached, appellants brought an action in equity. The lower court held that a homemaker was a proper subject of the occupation tax but permanently enjoined the collection of an occupation tax from &quot;housewives&quot; until the classification was made equally applicable to both sexes. Appellants sought review but the court dismissed their appeal as nonjusticiable, holding that they lacked standing to bring the appeal. The court found that although one issue was decided against appellants, they won their case and could not claim to have been &quot;aggrieved&quot; by the decision. The court concluded that appellants' concern about possible future action by the taxing authorities in amending the resolutions did not constitute a controversy appropriate for the court's review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner professional employee appealed from a decision of the Secretary of Education (Pennsylvania), which sustained his dismissal by respondent Board of School Directors for immoral and cruel conduct, based on comments he made to a female student.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Board of School Directors (board) filed charges against petitioner professional employee pursuant to 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;1-101 et seq., based on comments he made to a female student. The student alleged that petitioner called her a slut and a prostitute. Following a hearing, respondent found that the statements were of such a nature as to constitute &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;cruel&quot; conduct which were grounds for termination of petitioner's contract with the school district. The secretary of education (secretary) affirmed the dismissal, and petitioner sought further review. The court affirmed because the secretary made no error of law or abuse of discretion in finding that the hearings were fair, impartial, and unbiased. The court reasoned that the questions the board members asked the witnesses were not prejudicial or biased but showed a genuine desire to elicit from the witnesses all of the pertinent information surrounding petitioner's statements to the complainant student. Petitioner and his witnesses were given ample opportunity to present their version of what transpired. Further, the testimony was confined to the issues raised in the statement of charges before respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision that affirmed petitioner professional employee's dismissal because the secretary of education made no error of law or abuse of discretion in finding that the hearings were fair, impartial, and unbiased. The court also ruled that the secretary properly found petitioner's statements to be immoral and cruel, since calling a young girl a slut offended the morals of the community and inflicted embarrassment upon her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee developers wanted to build townhouses on a tract that was zoned for single family residential dwellings.

Appellant board denied appellees' request on the ground that townhouses were not totally banned in the township. The trial court permitted township, landowner, and association to intervene in support of appellant board's decision, but reversed the decision because it concluded that the zoning ordinance wrongfully prohibited townhouse development. Reviewing appellant board's refusal of the curative amendment, the court found that the zoning ordinance explicitly excluded rowhouses in a multi-family district and did not permit township development in an industrial district as appellants contended. The court affirmed the trial court's order because the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional for totally prohibiting township use.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developers challenged an order by the Centre County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania), which dismissed its appeal requesting zoning changes. Appellants claimed that the newly amended ordinance that prohibited mobile home parks was invalid because it was exclusionary, it was adopted to forestall their plan, and it was unconstitutional under the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 Pa. Stat. &sect; 11004.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developers had worked for a long period of time with city planners and zoning commissioners to open and develop a new mobile home community. It had presented elaborate slide presentations to the local governmental officials so that they all knew what it was planning and so that it could assist them in any questions or zoning problems that could have arose. Appellee zoning board unilaterally adopted new ordinances very near the ground breaking time for appellants. Appellants argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was a token, exclusionary, and its main purpose was to forestall appellants from opening the park. The court agreed that the ordinance was improper and it reversed. The court ordered the zoning officials to issue the appropriate permits for the development proposed by appellants, and it was to measure compliance with all of the subdivision controls, building codes, and regulations as it stood when appellants originally submitted their permit applications.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the zoning ordinances, which prohibited mobile home parks from being built.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant firefighter candidates were at the top of the certification list for appellee city and civil service commission when appellees decided to certify 50 percent minority candidates rather than those at the top of the competitive list for hiring as firefighters.

On appeal, the court reversed and held that reasonable grounds did not exist for the denial of an injunction by the trial court. The court found that appellees violated the express terms of the Civil Service Act (CSA), 53 P.S. &sect; 23493.1, and that the trial court erred in finding that federal and state laws took precedence over the CSA, and that no provision in the Human Relations Act, 43 P.S. &sect; 951 et seq., or the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000e-2(j) which allowed for such reverse discrimination.

On appeal, the court affirmed the order of the finance board that the settlement was proper and held that the CIT clearly applied to appellant because it applied to &quot;every corporation,&quot; not just foreign corporations. The court found that the imposition of CIT did not violate the uniformity clause of the Pennsylvania constitution because it was applied to other domestic corporations, and where it was not, the Corporate Net Income Tax was imposed; the two taxing schemes were found to be substantially the same in application. The court also found that the CIT did not constitute an unconstitutional tax on the privilege of doing business in the commonwealth, because such taxes did not violate U.S. Const. art.

The local zoning ordinances did not allow for mobile home parks. Appellant submitted a development plan to appellee commissioners and it was denied. On appeal, the trial court granted appellees' motion to quash. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court and found that the grant of the motion to quash was proper because appellant failed to follow the correct procedure for challenging the zoning law. The court found that appellant's challenge was to the substance of the zoning ordinance, not merely the denial by appellees, thus appellant should have proceeded pursuant to 53 P.S. &sect; 11004, which required appellant to submit the challenge either to the zoning hearing board for a report, or to the governing body with a request for a curative amendment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lessors used property owned by the state. Appellees, various county and local governments, sought payments in lieu of taxes under 71 P.S. &sect;&sect; 512(c), (d), which required that lessors of real property owned by the state for state highways make payments to the political subdivisions in which the property was situated equal to the taxes which would normally have been assessed against the property had it not been owned by the state. Appellants argued that the statute was unconstitutional. The court, on appeal, affirmed the order of the lower court and found that the classification scheme in the statute was rational and bore a legitimate relation to governmental interests. The court found that appellants enjoyed all the benefits of being within the political subdivision, such as police and fire protection, and since the state paid no taxes to appellees, appellees would have been required to provide those services to appellants for free. The court further found that because all members of the class of state lessors were treated equally, the statute did not violate Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, which required all taxes to have been uniform, upon the same class of subjects.</SPAN></P>

Appellants sought approval under the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. &sect; 11004(1)(b), for a curative amendment which would have allowed them to expand their non-conforming use which was denied and the Board of Supervisors then amended the zoning ordinance to allow for 50 percent expansion. The trial court found the blanket prohibition had been invalid, but dismissed appellant's action because of the amendment. On appeal, the court reversed and held that after the trial court found the zoning ordinance unlawful it should have determined whether appellant's proposal was reasonable and disregarded the amendment of the zoning ordinance which occurred after the challenge was submitted. The municipality could not thwart a valid challenge to its zoning ordinance by adopting a curative amendment.

Appellee Pennsylvania State Horse Racing Commission affirmed this ruling and set the period of suspension for five years. Appellant sought review. The court modified appellee's order and suspended appellant's license for two years. The court found that appellant's instructions to his jockey not to ride the horse to win could have been in violation of Rule 1.11. The court determined that the language in Rule 1.11, which allowed a suspension for acting &quot;to the detriment of racing,&quot; indicated that the rule was applicable to conduct other than that specifically mentioned in the Rules of Racing. The court concluded that Rule 1.11 contained proper standards for the exercise of discretion, and that it provided appellant with sufficient notice that his conduct was within its scope. Thus, there was substantial evidence in support of appellee's findings and conclusions. However, the court found that the revocation of appellant's license for five years was too severe.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee entered a plea of nolo contendere in federal court to operating an illegal gambling business in violation of 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2, 1955. Based solely on his plea and conviction, appellee school district terminated appellant's employment contract on the grounds of immorality and incompetency pursuant to 24 P.S. &sect; 11-1122. On administrative review, the Secretary of Education affirmed appellant's dismissal on the ground of immorality only. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal, rejecting appellant's argument that the nolo contendere plea was inadmissible in a civil proceeding. The court held that in a proceeding intended to protect the rights of many, as distinguished from a proceeding involving individual civil rights, his nolo contendere plea was admissible as evidence of admission of guilt. The court also found substantial evidence in the record to support appellee's decision. Finally, the court held that the term &quot;immorality&quot; as used in 24 P.S. &sect; 11-1122 was not unconstitutionally vague, having been judicially construed so as to foreclose the potential for abuse by a school board attempting to dismiss an employee merely for conduct incurring its disapproval.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant junkyard operator sought review of the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County (Pennsylvania) that affirmed the judgment of conviction sought and obtained by appellee township in summary proceedings before a justice of the peace. Appellee instigated the summary proceedings because appellant was operating his junkyard without a license, in violation of Mount Pleasant Township, Pa., Ordinance 35.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee township filed a complaint with a justice of the peace alleging that appellant junkyard operator was conducting his operation without a license. On appeal, the trial court upheld the judgment of conviction. The trial court also found that the junkyard was located in a flood plain district; thus, its presence was prohibited by Mount Pleasant Township, Pa., Ordinance 55. Appellant was ordered to cease and desist operations. The trial judge substituted for the justice's fine of $ 100 a seven-day prison term. The trial judge later modified his order, and in lieu of imprisonment appellant was to pay a fine of $ 50 per day so long as he continued to operate a junkyard on the subject premises. On further appeal, the court reversed and remanded because neither a judgment of a sentence of imprisonment nor that of a daily fine was authorized by statute as a penalty for violation of the zoning ordinances. The court observed that under clause XXV, &sect; 702 of the Second Class Township Code, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 65741, penalties for the violation of an ordinance could not exceed $ 300 and a sentenced of imprisonment could only be imposed in default of the payment.</SPAN></P>

Although appellant had operated his junkyard without a license in a district where junkyard's were prohibited, the court remanded because neither imprisonment nor a daily fine was authorized by statute as a penalty for violation of the zoning ordinances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a charitable trust, directed that all income be paid to charity for a period terminating 20 years after the death of the last of grantor's two sons; thereafter all income and principal, except for certain amounts required to be paid to charity, were to be paid to such persons or organizations as the grantor's two sons appointed by will. The trust received capital gains on the sale of principal assets, and incurred and paid taxes, for which it petitioned for refund. Appellee, the Board of Finance and Revenue, ruled that the capital gains were subject to taxation. On appeal, the court sustained appellee's ruling, and held that &sect; 301 of the Act of March 4, 1971, P.L. 6, added by the Act of August 31, 1971, P.L. 362, 72 P.S. &sect; 7301, defined a charitable trust as one operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, and excluded from the meaning of &quot;resident trust&quot; all charitable trusts. The court held that appellant had both charitable and non-charitable purposes, and could not be declared at any point in time as being administered only for its charitable purposes. Therefore, the tax was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the ruling of appellee, the Board of Finance and Revenue, which imposed a tax on appellant charitable trust's capital gains, because appellant had both charitable and non-charitable purposes and was therefore ineligible for the exemption from capital gains taxes allowed to charitable trusts.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that the cost of books, meals, transportation, and supplies should have been deducted from her income and that the arbitrary distinction between food stamp recipients who received student grants and those who did not violated the equal protection clause. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that nothing in the Food Stamp Act of 1964, 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2011 et seq., required that deductions include all necessary nonfood expenditures. The court held that the requirement in 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2016(b) that the price of the stamps should not exceed 30 percent of the household's income assumed that 70 percent of that income could be expended on nonfood necessities. Thus, there was a built in allowance for necessary expenses beyond the specific deductions. There was no impropriety in not allowing the deductions from a general education grant.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the legislature's grant of authority to defendant to adopt broad policies and standards governing the educational program of the commonwealth, Administrative Code, 71 P.

The commonwealth filed preliminary objections questioning the court's jurisdiction grounded upon sovereign immunity and the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board of Property (Board). Plaintiffs argued that the Board's jurisdiction was limited to cases arising from the operation of the Land Office and, alternatively, that the commonwealth court had concurrent jurisdiction over the matter. The court sustained the commonwealth's demurrer and transferred the action to the Board. The court held that its jurisdiction was barred the rule embodied in Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, that the commonwealth could not be sued without its consent. The court held that the fact that the commonwealth waived its immunity to quiet title actions before the Board could not be construed as a waiver of immunity in any other forum.</SPAN></P>

In their answer, appellants denied knowledge of how the assessment was made and attempted to deny all other allegations by invoking their privilege under U.S. Const. amend V. The trial court granted appellee's motion for judgment on the pleadings. Appellants argued that they should be allowed to amend their answers and that because appellee's complaint contained conclusions of law, their refusal to answer could not be deemed an admission. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that whether appellants received notice of the assessments and whether they appealed those assessments were facts, and that because appellants failed to properly deny those factual allegations they were deemed to have admitted their failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The court held that because appellants never petitioned the trial court to amend their answers, the issue could not be raised on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former employee was employed by the Pennsylvania Department of Justice (DOJ) in Philadelphia until April 30, 1975, when, having given DOJ 30 days' notice, she terminated her employment to accompany her husband who was transferred to Harrisburg. Unable to find employment in Harrisburg, she applied for unemployment compensation benefits. It was undisputed that during a substantial part of the six-month period prior to leaving work or to filing a claim for benefits, appellant was not the sole or major support of her family. The Bureau of Employment Security disallowed her claim under the provisions of the Unemployment Compensation Law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 802. The referee and appellee Unemployment Compensation Board of Review affirmed the determination. The court affirmed, holding that the distinction drawn by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 802(b) found a rational basis in the underlying philosophy of the Unemployment Compensation Law, that the distinction involved no invidious discrimination, and that the section passed muster under U.S. Const. amend.

Appellants mailed their petitions within the 60-day period set forth in &sect; 232 of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, 72 Pa. Cons.

Appellee refused appellants' petitions for review on the basis that appellee lacked jurisdiction over the petitions because appellants did not file them within 60 days as required by &sect; 7234. On appeal, the court affirmed, noting that a previous decision of the court had held that simply mailing a petition for review within the 60-day period specified in &sect; 7234 did not constitute filing and that actual receipt of the petition by appellee within the period was required. The court rejected appellants' argument that &sect; 7234&nbsp;unconstitutionally denied them equal protection of the law, ruling that it was not unreasonable that the act of mailing of notice was used as a guidepost for determining the start of the 60-day period.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer understated its corporate net income tax return by more than five percent. The Department of Revenue (department), pursuant to 72 P.S. &sect; 3385(b) (1970), settled an additional tax at 10 percent of the amount of appellant's understatement. Appellee Board of Finance and Revenue refused the prayer of appellant's petition for review of the department's settlement. The court dismissed the appeal, holding that because the statute was designed to raise revenue, the legislature had wide discretion in classifying subject, and that absent capricious or arbitrary classification, the statute did not violate the uniformity and the equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The court held that there was nothing arbitrary or capricious in the different treatment of those who paid tentative tax in the amount provided and those who did not. The court also held that because there was nothing in the statute's failure to provide for amendment of tentative returns that demonstrated that the additional tax was adopted as a disguise for the exercise of a different and forbidden power, the statute did not offend due process.</SPAN></P>

None of them paid wage taxes pursuant to the Wage and Net Profits Tax Ordinance, Philadelphia, Pa., Code &sect; 19-1500 et seq. (1973) (Code). Appellee brought an action in assumpsit to collect back taxes and to assess interest and penalties pursuant to Code &sect; 19-508(1). The trial court granted appellee's motions for summary judgment or motions for judgment on the pleadings against each appellant. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that appellants' invocation of the U.S. Const. amend. V privilege against self-incrimination in their answer to appellee's complaint was not effective to deny appellee's allegations. The proceedings were civil in nature, not criminal or quasi-criminal, and appellants were not in apprehension of such proceedings being commenced against them.

The court also held that the statute of limitations had not run, and the denials of appellants' requests for oral argument were within the discretion of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that it did not possess the legal authority to include a provision in the collective bargaining agreement requiring that all disputes be submitted to arbitration, and even if the arbitrator had jurisdiction to render his award, the award did not draw its essence from the basic agreement. On appeal the court held that appellant having agreed to, and participated in, the arbitration proceedings, without any suggestion that the proceedings were questionable, it could not seek to vacate the award on the ground that the proceedings were a nullity. The court also noted that the general assembly required arbitration. The court stated that the award of the arbitrator would be sustained so long as it drew its essence from the collective bargaining agreement, and that an award met this test if the interpretation could in any rational way be derived from the agreement, viewed in the light of its language, its context, and any other indicia of the parties' intention.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant licensee sought review of the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) affirming the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board's revocation of its hotel liquor license. Appellant argued that 47 P.S. &sect; 4-471's &quot;upon any other sufficient cause shown&quot; was unconstitutionally vague, indefinite, and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, holder of a hotel liquor license, leased its facilities to a charitable organization that conducted a casino night with gambling. Because appellant's liquor license had been suspended, the charitable organization provided and sold the liquor on those evenings. After a hearing, the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board revoked appellant's license because it permitted the sale of liquor on its premises and permitted gambling. Appellant sought review after the court of common pleas affirmed the revocation. Affirming the decision, the court explained that either finding supported the revocation because a licensee could not have permitted liquor to have been sold on the premises during a suspension and permitting gambling on the premises was a violation of criminal law regardless of any charitable purpose or lack of prosecution. Rejecting appellant's argument that the &quot;upon any other sufficient cause shown&quot; provision of 47 P.S. &sect; 4-471 was unconstitutionally vague, the court explained that a proceeding to revoke a license under the liquor laws had always been considered civil and administrative, and the provision was proper to accomplish the remedial purposes of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the court of common pleas upholding the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board's revocation of appellant's hotel liquor license; the license could have been revoked for allowing liquor to have been served while the license was suspended or for permitting gambling; the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The wastes then flowed into the borough's activated sludge plant and other sewage facilities in a manner which did not comply with environmental legislation and the state environmental department. To remedy the situation, appellant's engineers proposed construction of a fruit waste disposal system in two neighboring townships that would pump the waste to lagoons. Appellant sought a curative amendment to each county's zoning ordinances because the 26-acre site proposed for the treatment operation was located in residentially zoned districts. Respondents, supervisors of neighboring townships, denied appellant's request. The lower court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that appellant's use was accessory, and neither township imposed a total exclusion on the proposed use as an accessory use. The court affirmed each township's zoning ordinances as constitutional, permitting in their industrial zones everything appellant proposed doing in respondents' residential districts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver's motor vehicle operating privileges were revoked by appellee commonwealth for one year pursuant to the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.

Cons. Stat. &sect; 780-113(a)(30). When his appeal from the revocation was dismissed by the lower court, appellant sought review. The court found that the evidence, including appellant's own testimony, demonstrated that appellant had utilized a motor vehicle in the unlawful transportation of a controlled substance.

Appellant claimed the trial court capriciously ignored its evidence, and appellee claimed that &sect; 493(10) of the Liquor Code, 47 P.S. &sect; 4-493(10), was unconstitutional for vagueness. The court affirmed because the trial court had the power to reduce the penalty and it was not an abuse of discretion to exercise that power. The words &quot;lewd, immoral and improper&quot; were not unconstitutionally vague or indefinite. The court also noted that no one had a constitutional right to engage in the business of selling alcoholic beverages and that actions against licensees violating the Liquor Code were civil and administrative proceedings and not criminal in nature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed defendant landlords' and form sellers' preliminary objections to plaintiff commonwealth's complaint for injunctive relief from their use of form leases, alleging violations of the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (Act),73 P.S. &sect; 201-1 et seq. The matter came before the court on remand of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The court overruled defendants' procedural preliminary objections and those relating to plaintiff's remedy at law because defendants abandoned them. As to their objections on whether plaintiff stated a cause of action, the court concluded that to comply with the supreme court's opinion in Monumental II a record had to be established from which it could make findings of fact and conclusions of law to determine whether the failure to notify a tenant was misleading and whether use of certain language in a form lease violated the Act. The court permitted plaintiff to amend its complaint which was confusing and lacked specificity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff's suit for relief from defendants' use of form leases, the court granted plaintiff's motions to compel production, and for leave to discontinue, but denied leave for discovery. The court overruled defendants' abandoned preliminary objections for procedural questions and on adequacy of remedy, but sustained the rest to the extent the complaint lacked specificity. Defendant form sellers' complaint was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court maintained that the board of judges was empowered by statute and by the needs of judicial administration to select or discharge employees; however, the board did not enjoy exclusive control over wages and benefits. As such, the court concluded that judges enjoyed joint employer status with county commissioners for purposes of collective bargaining pursuant to the Public Employee Relations Act (Act 195). The court held that Act 195 was not an unconstitutional intrusion upon an independent judiciary as judicial review was afforded to persons challenging actions of the PLRB. Accordingly the orders were affirmed as to denial of the certifications and reversed as to the board's conclusion of law that the board of judges held sole public employer status of directly related court employees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Insurance Commissioner (commissioner) approved rates for coal mine occupational disease insurance for the second year under an expanded program. Appellants, an intervenor association and coal mining companies, challenged the rate structure. The court, recognizing the commissioner's discretion in setting rates, reviewed the applicable law, and the complexity of insurance rate making, in light of the new statutory coverage. The commissioner had adopted rates, based on a proposed rate filing submitted by an actuarial firm to appellee rating bureau, after several elements were revised. The court found no showing that the actuarial firm was not equitable and impartial, or that the personnel of the firm were not qualified to prepare the rate filing. The use of data from other states was appropriate due to the absence of data under the new program. However, the court found a lack of substantial evidence to support the presumed shift in the ratio of state to federal claims in computing rates for surface and deep mine operators; thus, no deference had to be given to commissioner's findings on this issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed in part the order of the Insurance Commissioner and remanded the matter to take additional evidence of the propriety of the assumed state to federal claim ratio and the resulting rate structure for deep and surface mine operators.

The court stated that some total exclusion of land uses did not shift the burden of proof to the municipality to justify the exclusion. Heliports, particularly in residential areas, embodied a land use, the total exclusion of which appeared prima facie to be designed to protect the public interest. The prohibition of heliports also related to police power goals. Thus, the zoning ordinance retained its presumption of validity, which appellant failed to overcome. Accordingly, the court affirmed the order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a complaint of discrimination against her law firm employer based on sex and age pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 955(a). After learning of the administrative complaint, defendant law firm placed plaintiff on indeterminate leave of absence with pay. Defendant also took steps to reassign cases being handled by plaintiff and otherwise disassociated her from the firm. Plaintiff then filed a second complaint of discrimination based on retaliatory conduct prohibited by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 955(d). The Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (commission) acted on the second complaint and entered an order directing defendant law firm to restore plaintiff to the position she occupied before being placed on leave. Defendant law firm appealed and the court affirmed. The court noted that its review was limited to a determination of whether the factual findings were supported by substantial evidence, whether the adjudication was made in accordance with the law, and whether there was an abuse of discretion in the relief awarded. The court noted that the facts were largely undisputed and that defendant did not challenge the factual findings of the commission.</SPAN></P>

Appellee filed a suit against appellant for collection of the claimed tax and obtained a judgment against appellant together with interest and costs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners challenged an eminent domain action and sought equitable relief against defendants, the state transportation secretary, city redevelopment authority, and city, for a taking for the purpose of widening a public street. Plaintiffs argued that the street improvement project would substantially impair plaintiffs' ingress and egress to their property. Plaintiffs sought damages. Upon exercising its original jurisdiction, the court held that plaintiffs were not entitled to money damages from defendant secretary of state or an order compelling defendant secretary to file a declaration of taking because that defendant was shielded by the doctrine of sovereign immunity for affirmative acts performed within his scope of office. Defendant secretary was imbued with legislative authority to improve public streets. The remaining defendants, who were not state actors, were outside the court's original jurisdiction. The court dismissed plaintiffs' claims against defendant secretary of state and transferred the remaining claims to the appropriate court of common pleas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court exercised its original jurisdiction and held that defendant secretary of state was immune from plaintiff landowners' suit in equity and therefore could not be ordered to pay damages or file a declaration of taking.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, individual taxpayer from one action and a class of taxpayers from a second action, sued to challenge a new income tax. As a result of the elimination of the city tax, appellees, township, borough, and local taxing authorities, removed the credit against appellants' local tax liabilities, resulting in no reduction of appellants' tax liability. Appellee borough challenged the lower court's application of the Enabling Act, 53 P.S. &sect; 6902(5), which automatically halved the tax rates, and appellant individual taxpayer challenged the lower court's dismissal of his action. The court held that the appellant individual taxpayer's attempt to seek a credit pursuant to 53 P.S. &sect; 6914 was without merit. The court held that the lower court erred in holding that the automatic reduction of the tax rates, designed to lessen the tax burden on residents of the Borough and School District, also inured to the benefit of nonresidents even though no duplication of taxes existed as to them.

On appeal, appellant asserted that the prohibition against active participation in political campaigns by civil service workers violated his rights to free speech under the federal and state constitutions. The court replied that the United States Supreme Court rejected the same argument against a similar statute. Next, the court found no merit in appellant's argument that the prohibition was unconstitutional discrimination. Finally, the court did not find the statute to be void for vagueness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A cause of action for nuisance against defendant mine owner was remanded for further proceedings by the state supreme court. In its opinion on remand the supreme court held that the discharge of acid mine drainage from defendant's mine into the waters of plaintiff commonwealth constituted a public nuisance at common law as well as under the applicable statutory law, and that relief could be granted under either theory. The absence of facts supporting concepts of negligence, foreseeability, or unlawful conduct was not fatal to a finding that a common law nuisance existed. And the doctrine of laches, waiver, or estoppel as against the plaintiff were not available to defendant nor could those who pollute streams acquire prescriptive or property rights to so pollute as against the commonwealth. The trial court found that instituting a clean up requirement of defendant as an exercise of police power was the only abatement available and that it did not constitute a taking of defendant's property without just compensation, nor was it outside of reasonable parameters. Therefore, defendant was ordered to institute a cleanup process of the acid mine drainage.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, appellants introduced evidence showing that there previously erected signs met the existing law at the time they were erected, that the signs were expensive, would be of greater expense to reproduce, and that it would cost hundreds of dollars to remove them. Appellees controverted by attempting to prove that the ordinance would eliminate hazards to motorists and pedestrians, facilitate firefighting, escalate real estate values, and would be aesthetic to the community.

</DIV>

The court sustained defendant's preliminary objection going to justiciability, and dismissed the complaint. The court held that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the propriety of an executive order which was a broad statement of public or political policy and thus within the sole discretion of the Governor; and because the doctrines of separation of powers, executive sovereignty and comity with the coordinate branches of government precluded the court from exercising its jurisdiction to inquire into the propriety of a discretionary decision of the executive branch of government.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed plaintiff's complaint seeking to enjoin enforcement of an executive order promulgated by defendant Governor of Pennsylvania.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation filed an application for two branch office licenses for the purpose of undertaking in the state. The application for the two branch offices was denied. When appellant received its initial license, it maintained funeral homes at three separate locations in the city. One office was subsequently moved before it closed down. Thereafter, a law was passed stating that no branch licenses would be granted to any corporation. One of the two remaining locations of the corporation was used for funerals for several years and then closed. The last location was destroyed by fire, but had been rebuilt and remained the sole place of business before being sold. Upon review, appellant asserted that its prior operation of three locations entitled it to operate three locations pursuant to a grandfather clause in the new law. The court held that a landowner's right to a nonconforming use may be forfeited upon his abandonment of that use. As appellant had discontinued funeral operations and failed to conduct branch office activities since then, it lost any rights under the grandfather clause. The decision of the state board of funeral directors was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for violating an ordinance by the Lycoming County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania), which found him guilty, and sentenced him to fines and costs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating a land use ordinance after which he was sentenced to fines and costs. Defendant claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutional. Defendant owned two lots, he conveyed one to his son, and the son immediately reconveyed back to defendant. Defendant claimed that under 53 Pa. Stat. &sect; 10515, he was being arbitrarily restrained from using his land in the way that he saw fit, and that the statute therefore violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that so long as the statute relating to land use was used to regulate heath, safety, or welfare of health of citizens, then it would have overridden any private rights held by defendant. The court said that it was satisfied that defendant had not carried the burden of proving that the ordinance was invalid. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for violating a local ordinance requiring documentation of conveyed property. The court held that a land use statute was constitutional so long as its purpose was related to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the citizens of the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth sought to forfeit defendant's residence pursuant to the Pennsylvania Controlled Substances Forfeiture Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6801(a)(6)(I)(C) because an informant had purchased controlled substances from defendant at his residence. Defendant argued that he was entitled to a stay of the forfeiture proceedings pending the disposition of criminal charges against him, and that the Act itself was unconstitutional because it provided a civil penalty so punitive in purpose and effect as to negate the General Assembly's intention to provide for a civil penalty. Because the Commonwealth conceded that defendant was entitled to retain his residence pending the outcome of his criminal trial, the court granted the portion of defendant's motion that sought a stay. The court denied the remainder of the motion, however, opining that the Act was not unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the stated purpose of the Act was to remove the incentive to engage in the drug trade, and that the Act's statutory scheme was not so punitive either in purpose or effect so as to negate that intention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother told the father that she intended to have an abortion. The father argued that the Act was unconstitutional because it failed to recognize his rights as the natural father and that a recent decision changed the status of the law about abortion. The court granted the preliminary injunction because an abortion would constitute irreparable harm. The court first determined that it had jurisdiction. Although the mother had filed an application for a stay or dissolution of the preliminary injunction with a superior court and her case was pending, the final hearing was an integral part of the proceedings, and the mother's appeal to the superior court was premature and in violation of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. The court then dissolved the preliminary injunction because it found that the father and the unborn child lacked standing. The father could not veto the mother's fundamental right to make the abortion decision, and the recent decision did not alter the law. The word &quot;person&quot; did not include the unborn child; thus, the unborn child lacked standing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testimony showed that defendants operated a day-care center in their home. The home was one-half of a double home. While it operated, one defendant's sister began to hear yelling and other noises through the wall in the other home that adjoined defendants' household. The observer heard the noises on her visits to defendants' home, which occurred at least on a daily basis. The observer reported hearing obscene language, arguing over explicit sexual issues, obscenities, threats, and smacking noises followed by children crying and screaming. On appeal, defendants claimed that the trial court erred by allowing the three Commonwealth child witnesses to testify via closed-circuit television and on videotape. The trial court had determined pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5985, which permitted testimony via closed-circuit television, the witnesses could testify. The court held that defendants were entitled to a new trial because fears, anxiety, and mild trauma were not sufficient findings of particularized harm to justify removing a witness from the courtroom during the testimony. The harm was not sufficient to permit the abridgment of defendants' right of confrontation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer employed the employee as a freight handler in a warehouse. While on the job, the employee was injured by another jack operated by a fellow employee. The employee received workers' compensation benefits pursuant to a notice of compensation. The employee then filed the present suit alleging that his employer was liable for the fellow employee's intentional or negligent conduct in failing to provide a safe workplace when the employer knew of the personal animosity between the employee and the fellow employee. The employer demurred to the allegations on three bases. The employer stated that the employee's claim was barred by his election of his workers' compensation remedy; second, that the employee was estopped from alleging that his injury did not arise in the course of his employment; and third, that the claim was barred by the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata. The court held that the employee, who had received workers' compensation benefits for the injuries inflicted by the fellow employee in the course of employment, could not then also sue his employer under the &quot;personal-animus&quot; exception to Pa.

The court held that &sect; 904 violated the Fourteenth Amendment because identification had not been defined statutorily or by the courts. By failing to prescribe with clarity under what circumstances an individual could be stopped and asked to produce identification or what a detainee had to do to comply, &sect; 904 vested game commission officers with unbridled discretion to interrogate whomever they choose under any circumstances they chose and left to their sole discretion whether or not the compliance was adequate. Imposing criminal sanctions on an individual who did nothing more than decline to state his name to an officer of the law and who was not the subject of any investigation was a patent violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment that rendered &sect; 904&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

The wife was separated from her husband. The husband and wife both agreed that the wife would receive continued health care benefits from the husband's insurance. However, the insurer's position was that because the parties were separated it was not obligated to provide coverage for the wife and it was not responsible for the wife's outstanding medical bills. The wife's position was that coverage had to continue pursuant to COBRA and the company's plan because the parties were not yet divorced or legally separated as Pennsylvania did not recognize a state of legal separation. The court found that because Pennsylvania did not recognize the state of legal separation, the qualifying event had to be the parties' divorce; and thus, the insurer erred in denying coverage to the wife.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury verdict that exonerated defendant, an automobile service and repair company, from liability and found plaintiff dump truck driver 70 percent negligent, the driver filed a motion for a new trial. The driver had filed a negligence action against the company, alleging that the company was negligent in failing to adequately repair the brakes on the truck. The driver had been hurt when the truck was hit by a train.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue at trial was whether the truck was on the tracks due to a failure of the braking system or due to the driver's negligent operation of the vehicle. Several witnesses, including the driver's employer (an original party to the action who was later dismissed), one of the company's employees, and a police officer, testified that the driver had not mentioned brake failure as the cause of the accident, either at a hospital after the accident or four days thereafter. The driver filed a motion to preclude the admission of the testimony under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7101, which was denied. The driver contended that the court erred in admitting the statements that he had made to the witnesses while he was confined to the hospital. Denying the motion for a new trial, the court held that &sect; 7101(a)(1) limited the language of &sect; 7101(a)(2) so that the exclusionary rule was applicable only to statements obtained by persons with adverse interests who took the statement for the purpose of negotiating a settlement or obtaining a release.

Stat. &sect; 6801 et seq., was instituted by the Commonwealth to seize the landowners' property on which suspected marijuana plants were found. The bank intervened as a mortgage holder. The court found that the bank had standing to challenge the forfeiture by virtue of its lien on the property. The court granted the bank's demurrer on the ground that the former forfeiture act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 35, &sect; 780-128 (Supp. 1988), did not apply because such act only subjected real property to forfeiture in limited instances that did not appear in the case. The court granted the bank's preliminary objection to strike paragraph six of the amended petition because the paragraph contained several material allegations and thus, did not comply with Pa. R. Civ. P. 1022. The court denied the bank's preliminary objections attacking other paragraphs because the objections were not requests for a more specific pleading.

Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 1101.201 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a breakdown in negotiations, the teachers called a strike. Upon the declaration of the school board that it would not seek an injunction, notwithstanding the resulting inability to obtain 180 days of instruction as mandated by the Public School Code, 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 15-1501, plaintiffs sought a declaration as to the constitutionality of &sect; 1003 of the Public Employee Relations Act (PERA), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 1101.201 et seq., which allowed teacher strikes unless such strike created a clear and present danger or threat to the health, safety, or welfare of the public. Opining that to allow an interested party to determine when judicial intervention was needed in a labor dispute directly conflicted with the constitutional requirement of a thorough and efficient public education system under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 14, the court held &sect; 1003 of PERA unconstitutional as a direct contravention of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 14. Moreover, the court concluded that by the provisions of PERA, the state legislature had failed to provide measures to ensure 180 days' attendance as mandated by the Code, which sufficed as a clear and present danger to the rights of the students.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an injured motorcycle driver, challenged an order granting summary judgment to defendant Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). At issue was whether the Pennsylvania Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8522, was unconstitutional, vague, and overbroad or violated the due process rights of an injured party by requiring him to prove that prior written notice of a road defect was given to PennDOT.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was injured when his motorcycle struck a pothole and went out of control on a state highway. Though he sued PennDOT for failure to properly maintain the roadway, PennDOT moved for summary judgment on the basis that the Act barred such claims against PennDOT unless the claimant showed that it had actual, written notice of the alleged defect prior to the accident. When the driver was unable to show such notice, summary judgment was granted. The driver challenged the ruling on the basis that the Act was unconstitutional, but the court rejected those challenges. Specifically, the court found that the driver's claims that the Act was &quot;vague and overbroad&quot; and &quot;impermissibly sweeping&quot; intended to assert a First Amendment claim but that no claim was presented because the Act did not infringe at all upon protected speech. Second, the court found that the driver's Due Process claim was meritless because the Act was rationally related to legitimate governmental objectives and the Commonwealth was entitled to strike a balance, as reflected therein, between the right of a driver to recover and the right of the Commonwealth to maintain fiscal security.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court approved of its prior order rejecting the motorist's constitutional challenges to the Act and granting summary judgment to PennDot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted his belief that neither he nor anyone else similarly situated was required by law to file a Pennsylvania personal income tax return.

Following his conviction, defendant filed a motion in arrest of judgment or, in the alternative, a motion for a new trial predicated on the assertion that the Commonwealth presented insufficient evidence to establish the element of willfulness beyond a reasonable doubt. The court stated that the underlying premise of both the Commonwealth and the federal &quot;willful&quot; requirement was to separate those taxpayers who through negligence, inadvertence, or mistake failed to comply with statutory requirements from those who demonstrated an obdurate refusal to acknowledge what the tax code required. The record was replete with evidence which was inconsistent with a credible claim of good-faith misunderstanding of the requirements of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a multi-family council, brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief seeking to have defendant city's condominium conversion privilege tax (condo tax) declared void and unenforceable. The council claimed that the Pennsylvania Uniform Condominium Act, 68 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3100 et seq., expressly preempted the city's authority to impose the condo tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The condo tax made the owner of a rental apartment building liable for the tax if he converted his building to condominiums. However, if the building was converted to cooperative ownership, no tax was due. The court held that the condo tax was unconstitutional. The Act provided that a real estate use law, ordinance, or regulation could not prohibit the condominium, which it would not impose upon a physically identical development under a different form of ownership. Clearly the condo tax imposed a burden on condominiums that it did not impose on property that was identical but for its form of ownership. In addition, the condo tax violated Pa. Const. art. 8, &sect; 1, which provided that all taxes had to be uniform upon the same class of subjects. When there existed no legitimate distinction between the classes and the tax scheme imposed substantially unequal burdens upon persons otherwise similarly situated, the tax was unconstitutional. The city's purpose in enacting the condo tax was to prevent conversion of rental apartments to condominiums. That was a prohibited purpose. Therefore, the tax was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The condo tax was declared unconstitutional and the judicial relief requested was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The daughter testified her parents were unaware that she was having sex. The doctor testified that he advised the mother that it was not advised to put a girl of 13 on birth control and that a pregnancy at that age would be harmful. The Commonwealth had argued that because the parents were aware of the fact their daughter was dating the father of her unborn child and because the daughter was only 13 years old, the parents were guilty of endangering their child from the harms of pregnancy at such a young age in allowing her to become pregnant. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that because the baby had not been born, there was no proof that actual harm had come to the daughter and therefore, the was not sufficient evidence to uphold the verdict.</SPAN></P>

At issue was whether the parents and the child had acquired a vested right in their action for wrongful birth.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor was the low bidder at the initial bid opening for the project but was denied the bid because it did not comply with the minority set-aside provisions of the board. The board decided to rebid the project following an initial injunction issued in the matter but still included the provisions for set-aside. The court determined that there was absolutely no testimony that the contractor ever discriminated against anyone. The court held that the action was not frivolous. The contractor raised a significant challenge to the constitutionality of the board's set-aside program because all rigid quotas for minorities have been seriously questioned and considered &quot;highly suspect&quot; by the United States Supreme Court. The court held that the program was precisely the broad kind of set-aside the Supreme Court condemned. The court found that there was irreparable harm from a bid opening because it was impossible to measure the potential damage caused to the contractor if other bidders could see the amount of the contractor's bid a second time. Also, the order maintained the status quo.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The paving company was the low bidder at the initial bid opening for the project, but was denied the bid because it did not comply with the minority set-aside provisions of the board. The board decided to rebid the project following an initial injunction issued by the court, but still included the provisions for set-aside. The court granted the temporary restraining order, holding that (1) the action is not frivolous, but raised a significant challenge to the constitutionality of the set-aside program; (2) there was irreparable harm from a bid opening because it was impossible to measure the potential damage caused to the paving company if other bidders could see the amount of its bid a second time; (3) the order maintained the status quo. The set-aside program was invalid because the general statistics of discrimination that were submitted were not sufficient, it was a highly suspect rigid quota system, and there was no showing of discrimination by the paving company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant automobile dealer sought review of a decision of appellee township's zoning hearing board (Pennsylvania), which directed the dealer to remove a vehicle from the roof of its property on the ground that it violated appellee township's sign ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealer had, for a number of years, placed a single car on its rooftop for advertising purposes. Several months after a new sign ordinance became effective, the dealer received a notice of violation of Manheim, Pa., Zoning Ordinance No. 1987-30, &sect; 1706-A(4), and it appealed, arguing that &sect; 1706-A(4) did not apply because the car was not a sign. The board, however, disagreed. The court, in affirming, found that the board committed no abuse of discretion or error of law. Among other things, the court found that a vehicle on the rooftop constituted a &quot;sign,&quot; as defined in Manheim, Pa., Zoning Ordinance No. 1987-30, &sect; 1701, because it was placed there as an advertisement. Furthermore, the court rejected the assertion that Manheim, Pa., Zoning Ordinance No. 1987-30, &sect; 1706-A(4) was inapplicable, noting instead that a car on top of a building was &quot;attached&quot; to the building. In addition, the court found that the dealer was not entitled to claim a non-conforming use because it failed to prove that the practice was lawful prior to the enactment of the ordinance. Finally, the court determined that the ordinance was constitutional and was not an improper exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the dealer's appeal and affirmed the board's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant approached the victim after she left a party, put a knife to her throat, and forced her into an abandoned house, where he assaulted her. She eventually managed to escape and immediately told her brother what had happened, but the two were unable to locate defendant. The victim then spent the night at her boyfriend's apartment, and she reported the assault to police the next morning. Defendant argued that the court erred in refusing to allow him to question the victim regarding her sexual activities with her boyfriend after the attack, alleging that the information was relevant as to her credibility. The court, in affirming its denial of defendant's post-trial motions, disagreed. Noting that a victim's sexual history, whether before or after an attack, was only of minimal probative value, the court reasoned that Pennsylvania's Rape Shield Laws, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3104(a), (b), were designed to prevent the prejudicial effect of just such evidence as defendant sought to introduce. In addition, the court found that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence, noting that the jury had assessed the witnesses' credibility and had concluded that defendant was guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor daughter of respondent father was found ungovernable in a dependency hearing. At the placement review hearing, appellant, the Office of Children and Youth Services (OCY), accused the father of sexual abuse and requested a dependency adjudication, which was granted. Upon the filing of exceptions, however, the trial court reversed its determination of abuse. OCY appealed. The Superior Court (Pennsylvania) affirmed. OCY sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the dependency/abuse hearing, the child never testified, nor was any explanation offered by OCY for her absence from the courtroom. The father's counsel objected to the introduction of the child's hearsay statements and also raised the question of her unavailability. The hearsay statements were permitted into evidence pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5986. The trial court considered the statements against the father's denials and determined that OCY met is burden of proving sexual abuse against the father by clear and convincing evidence. Reversal of the adjudication order was based solely upon OCY's failure to either produce the child at the hearing or establish her unavailability. The court agreed that such failure on the part of OCY constituted a violation of the father's due process rights. The court held that fundamental fairness required that a parent accused of sexually abusing his child be given an opportunity to confront and cross-examine that child in dependency proceedings unless it was shown that the child was unavailable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court were defendant's post-trial motions for a new trial. Defendant was found guilty by a jury of rape, indecent assault, and corrupting the morals of a minor, based on charges that he had sexually assaulted his 11-year-old niece behind some bushes in a public park. The assault was interrupted by a 13-year-old witness, who testified against defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in excluding testimony from the niece's playmate that, sometime before the alleged sexual assault by defendant, the niece had confided in the playmate that the witness who discovered the sexual assault had also molested the niece. The court held that the evidence had been properly excluded under Pennsylvania's Rape Shield Law, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3104. The evidence would not have exculpated defendant, was clearly irrelevant to his alibi defense, and would have unnecessarily prejudiced the victim by permitting unproven allegations of prior sexual activity with third parties to be presented before a jury. The court concluded that defendant had been sufficiently permitted to challenge the niece's credibility thorough his questioning of her on the stand. Defendant also challenged the prosecutor's closing remarks, which inferred that the niece had never accused anyone other than defendant of touching her in a sexual manner. The court held that the prosecutor, knowing that evidence to the contrary had been excluded, should not have made such an inference. However, the court held that any error had been cured by the court's jury instructions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Exceptant Department of Revenue challenged the judgment of the trial court (Pennsylvania), which sustained the executors' appeal from the department's decision disallowing certain inheritance tax deductions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executors had claimed deductions as administration expenses under &sect; 611 of the Pennsylvania Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961 for interest paid and payable on deferred federal estate tax, interest on unpaid state inheritance tax, and interest on loans used to pay federal and state taxes. The department disallowed the deductions, and its appeals board affirmed. The executors challenged the determination, and the lower court ruled in their favor. The department filed exceptions, and the court sustained the exceptions. The court held that the inheritance tax statute taken as a whole did not permit consideration of taxes as &quot;reasonable administration expenses&quot; otherwise allowable under &sect; 611. Although the executors acted reasonably in deciding to utilize the deferred method of payment and the borrowing of funds to pay interest on the tax was legitimate, the deduction of interest on taxes from the value of the property transferred was not within the purview of the statute. As the executors were not entitled to deduct the interest payments, the department's decision was proper.</SPAN></P>
