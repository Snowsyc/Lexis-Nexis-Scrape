</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant City of Lubbock sought review of a judgment in an action in which appellant was denied an injunction to enforce a housing commission's order against appellees property owners, and in which appellees had been awarded damages for their counterclaim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court affirmed the portion of the judgment denying an injunction, finding that appellant had not demonstrated an entitlement to the injunction. In reversing the portion of the judgment which awarded damages, the reviewing court found that a building inspector did not possess the requisite final policymaking authority necessary to find appellant liable for his actions under &sect; 1983. The court rejected the claim of an alleged violation of substantive due process rights, finding no deprivation of a property right. The court rejected the equal protection claim, finding that the building code contemplated governance of specified situations and therefore the housing commission's action taken pursuant to the code against appellees was not unreasonable. Moreover, appellees had failed to exhaust their administrative appeals of the housing commission's order finding their house substandard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant church foundation was a charitable, nonprofit organization that was tax-exempt under 26 U.S.C.S. 501(c)(3) (1988).

Appellant challenged appellee county's revocation of its tax-exempt status and challenged the trial court's grant of summary judgment to appellee on the issue. The court held that the language in appellant's trust agreement permitting it to make charitable contributions to other organizations did not satisfy the requirement of Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 11.18(f)(1), which required appellant's assets to be pledged to its charitable functions and did not permit the assets to be pledged to or used by another organization.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver sought review of his conviction by the County Court at Law, Ellis County, Texas, for driving with a suspended license in violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701h (1996), claiming that he was denied a speedy trial, that the information was insufficient to charge him with the crime, that he conclusively established a defense to the charge, and that he was denied due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellant driver was stopped by police for not wearing a seat belt, a check of his driver's license revealed that it was under a suspension order resulting from an unpaid judgment from a 1991 accident. Appellant challenged his conviction under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701h, &sect; 32(c)(1)(A) (1996) for driving a motor vehicle while his license to drive was suspended. The appeals court held that appellant failed to preserve for review his denial of a speedy trial claim. Appellant failed to attack the information at trial on the grounds asserted on appeal, thereby waiving any defects in the information. The existence of a liability insurance policy at the time of appellant's 1991 accident did not provide a defense under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701h, &sect; 1D (1996) to the charge of driving with a suspended license. Finally, appellant's ex post facto claim was meritless where his license suspension order was based on a court judgment, which was entitled to a presumption of regularity. However, the court reversed and remanded sua sponte, based on the trial court's error in failing to give a required &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; definitional jury instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no merit to appellant's points of error on appeal, but reversed his conviction for driving with a suspended license and remanded sua sponte, based on the trial court's error in failing to give a &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; definitional instruction to the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction under Houston Building Code &sect; 4605(a) for violating a sign ordinance was affirmed by the county court and defendant appealed. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the sign ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The court found that the ordinance clearly established that the sign usage proscribed was for advertising, and thus, the ordinance was not vague. The court concluded that the ordinance was not overbroad because it focused on advertising signs that were installed on a firm support and did not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. The court determined that the reason for the ordinance was to promote highway safety and beautification. Because this governmental interest was substantial and the regulations were drawn narrowly to achieve this interest, the court ruled that the ordinance was not a prior restraint on freedom of speech. The court found that although the ordinance did not specify a culpable mental state, a mandatory presumption of guilt was not created because the complaint against defendant and the jury charge included a culpable mental state.</SPAN></P>

In her appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting at the certification hearing certain statements she made without having received the warnings required pursuant to Tex. Fam.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, certified to stand trial as an adult, sought review of the certification order on the grounds that statements she made while in custody were inadmissible at the waiver and certification hearing because she had not been given the warnings required by Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 51.09(b) (1996). The court reversed the order and remanded to the trial court. In reversing, the court found that &sect; 51.09(b) was a mandatory evidentiary rule making inadmissible any statements obtained from a child not given the statutory warnings by a magistrate after the latter had examined the child independently and ascertained that the child had knowingly waived his or her rights. The court found that the only warnings given defendant were provided by a sheriff's deputy and therefore the statements she made were inadmissible in any future proceeding. The court rejected the state's argument that &sect; 51.09(b) warnings were not required because the child was not in custody. The facts showed that the child was taken to the police station, finger printed, photographed, and interrogated and that those circumstances would lead the child to believe her liberty had been curtailed.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded the summary judgment for appellees, sustaining appellant's two points of error that the trial court had not only incorrectly granted summary judgment for the supermarket but also incorrectly granted summary judgment on qualified immunity for the security officer.

Tax Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 171.001(a), 171.109(b) (1992), that governed the computation of a company's surplus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant utility was required to capitalize the imputed cost of funds, known as Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)-equity, used to build a new power plant. Appellant was required to report and pay an annual franchise tax, based on taxable capital, pursuant to Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 171.001 (1995). Appellant sought a refund of the difference between its tax as reported and paid, and its tax as it would have been computed without capitalizing its AFUDC-equity, a difference of approximately $ 3,000,000. Appellee comptroller denied the request for a refund, maintaining that generally accepted accounting principles reflected in Financial Accounting Standard 71 required appellant to capitalize its AFUDC-equity and then to depreciate it over the life of the structure. The court affirmed the trial court's summary judgment because the tax classification assailed by appellant did not run afoul of Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, which required equal and uniform taxation, and only recognized the fact that non-regulated enterprises do not enjoy a high probability that a return will be realized on their AFUDC-equity, unlike the return guaranteed to regulated companies through rates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that the difference in value between regulated and non-regulated enterprises provided more than sufficient justification for the disparate treatment of Allowance for Funds Used During Construction-equity, that the disparate tax treatment did not violate the Texas Constitution, and that appellee's adoption of the franchise tax rule fell within its delegated authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee corporation objected to the amount of the franchise tax imposed by appellee comptroller. Appellant had contracted with the United States military to manufacture fighter jets, which were periodically delivered to a military base in Texas. For federal income tax purposes, the company used the completed contract method, under which it realized the income upon completion of the contract. Appellant protested imposition of a franchise tax in 1991 under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 112.051-112.060 (1992 &amp; Supp. 1996), based on the full amount reflected in the contract. The district court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment, and the court affirmed on appeal. The franchise tax formula did not violate the commerce and due process clauses of the United States Constitution, nor the due course of law provision of the Texas Constitution. The single-factor formula used by Texas did not create a grossly excessive disparity in comparison with a three-factor formula used by most other states. Further, when the state adopted the tax, the legislation was prospective, so it did not impair any vested rights of appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling that the imposition of a franchise tax on appellant corporation by appellee comptroller was valid, as the statutory formula for calculating the tax was not shown to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the lower court erred in submitting the jury instruction concerning dual office holding under an interlocal contract.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the order from the 93rd District Court of Hidalgo County, Texas transferring him from the custody of the Texas Youth Commission into the custody of the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice to complete his sentence for murder. Appellant claimed that the transfer or release hearing under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 54.11 (Pamph. 1996) violated his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellant was 14, he was adjudicated delinquent for having committed murder and was sentenced to 30 years commitment to the Texas Youth Commission (TYC). Later, at appellant's release or transfer hearing appellant was transferred to the custody of the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice to serve the remainder of his sentence. On appeal, the court held that although, under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 51.13(a), appellant's adjudication of delinquency did not subject him to all the disabilities of a conviction, he had the same rights as an adult offender under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 51.10, 54.03(c), (f), 54.04(a) (1986 &amp; Pamph. 1996) to counsel, a jury, etc. at the time of his adjudication. Thus, he was not being incarcerated without having been convicted. Because the hearing did not determine appellant's guilt but determined if appellant should be released from confinement, the trial court properly considered the post-adjudication TYC reports and other factors permitted by Tex. Fam. Code &sect;&sect; 54.11(d), (k) (Pamph. 1996), and disclosed them to appellant's attorney as required by &sect; 54.11(d) (Pamph. 1996). Therefore, the court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order transferring appellant from the Texas Youth Commission's custody into the custody of the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. The court held that because appellant had been adjudicated delinquent for murder at a hearing where his due process rights were protected, his constitutional rights were not violated at the release or transfer hearing where post adjudication evidence was admitted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment from the Criminal District Court No. Three of Tarrant County (Texas) that adjudicated him guilty of sexual assault of a child following his trial for violations of his deferred adjudication probation. Appellant claimed that his sentence was vindictive, and that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12 &sect; 5(b) that precluded a right to appeal violated his due process rights under the Texas constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to sexual assault of a child and was placed on deferred adjudication probation. Appellee state filed a motion for adjudication because of appellant's probation violation. Appellant pled true, but was granted a new trial where he pled not true to the violations. After the trial, the trial court found that the violations occurred, adjudicated him guilty of sexual assault of a child, and sentenced him to a longer term than upon his true plea. On appeal, the court held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b) (Supp. 1996), which prohibited appeals from adjudications of guilt, did not violate appellant's due process rights under the Texas constitution because there was no right to appeal a criminal conviction in the Texas constitution. The court held that because appellant did not obtain the trial court's permission to appeal its failure to advise him of deportation penalties under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 26.13(a)(4) (1989), the court was precluded by Tex. R. App. P. 40(b)(1) from reviewing that issue, and that because the longer sentence was assessed after a full trial, it was not vindictive. Thus, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment adjudicating appellant guilty of sexual assault of a child after his trial for violations of his deferred adjudication probation. The court held that no right to appeal a criminal conviction existed in Texas constitution, thus the statute prohibiting appeal was constitutional, and the sentence was not vindictive because the trial court had more facts after trial than on the hearing on appellant's vacated true plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was charged with delivery of cocaine. Appellee filed a pretrial motion to suppress evidence, asserting that the evidence in the case was obtained as a result of illegal police conduct. The trial court granted appellee's motion to suppress, finding that police officers obtained evidence while performing an undercover investigation outside their jurisdiction. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it granted appellee's motion to suppress. Although the police officers had authority to investigate suspected criminal activity, the court determined that the officers were not authorized to conduct investigations outside of their county. The court stated that the fact that officers could have made a citizen's arrest was not relevant because the officers did not make such arrest. Instead, the officers purchased narcotics from appellee. Additionally, the officers could not have made a citizen's arrest in their capacity as police officers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the decision of the 252nd District Court (Texas), that convicted him of aggravated kidnapping on the grounds that it was error to allow an in-court identification, to admit evidence of an extrajudicial offense, and to fail to grant his motion for a mistrial due to the conduct of the state during jury argument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated kidnapping. He sought review arguing that it was error to admit the in-court identification and evidence of an extrajudicial offense, and that his motion for a mistrial should have been granted. The court found that the identification procedures were not unnecessarily suggestive merely because appellant was the only individual wearing a particular jacket. The court agreed that it was error to admit evidence of an extrajudicial offense finding that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 3(a) prohibited evidence regarding an offense committed prior to September 1, 1993 in a noncapital case. Because the alleged extraneous offense was nearly identical to the subject offense and the state frequently mentioned the extraneous offense, the court was unable to say beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence made no contribution to appellant's punishment. The court found that the state's jury arguments were reasonable deductions from the evidence, or that any error was cured by the instruction to disregard. The court affirmed the conviction, but reversed the punishment and remanded for a hearing on the punishment phrase.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney sought review of an order from the 168th District Court of El Paso County (Texas), which denied him habeas corpus relief in his suit against appellee state to stop searches of his belongings and persons upon entry of the county courthouse under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 2.01, 11, 14, and 15 (1996), U.S. Const. amend IV, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the restraint was lawful. The court held appellee was the appropriate party, as appellant's proceeding under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11 was a criminal proceeding subject to Tex. Code. Crim. Proc. art. 2.01 (1996). The court held appellant proved he was under restraint at the time he filed his application. Although appellant failed to establish he lacked an adequate remedy, good cause existed for the court to hear the appeal. The courthouse searches did not constitute arrests subject to Tex. Code. Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 14 and 15 as appellant was free to walk away from the search. His consent was qualified, rather than non-existent. The searches were permissible under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, as they were reasonable, brief, not intrusive and appellee had a legitimate interest in providing security at the courthouse.</SPAN></P>

The searches did not constitute arrests and therefore only required qualified consent to be done without a warrant. The searches did not violate the Fourth Amendment of the U. S. Constitution or equivalent provisions of the Texas constitution.</SPAN></P>

Appellant then filed her answer opposing the termination of her rights. The trial court upheld the termination of appellant's parental rights and denied appellant's motion for habeas corpus. On appeal, the court held that a forty-eight hour waiting period was applicable to appellant's voluntary termination of her parental rights. The court rejected appellee's arguments that the legislature never intended for the forty-eight hour waiting period to apply retroactively. The court found that the language of the effective date of the applicable statute made the extended waiting period retroactive. The court also held that the waiting period was not unconstitutionally retroactive because appellee did not have a vested right to the possessory conservatorship of the child.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the 283rd District Court of Dallas County (Texas), which convicted appellant of felony theft. Appellant asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(a),(b)(3) (1994) for appropriation of property in the custody of any law enforcement agency. Appellant asserted that the statute violated U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was indicted under Tex.

Appellant filed a pretrial motion to quash the indictments. The trial court denied appellant's pretrial motion to quash the indictments alleging that &sect; 37.03(a), (b)(3) violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex Const. art. I &sect; 19. Following the trial court's denial of appellant's motion, appellant entered a plea of nolo contendere and was found guilty as charged and placed on probation. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the statute was not vague because persons of common intelligence did not have to guess at its meaning and differ about its application, and the statute provided sufficient notice to law enforcement personnel to prevent arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. The court further held that due process was not violated when a defendant was predisposed to commit an offense, and a rational basis existed for the legislature's actions.</SPAN></P>

The court also affirmed the trial court's denial of appellant's request to make a bill of exceptions in connection with the denial of the motion to quash the indictment.

Appellant sought review of the judgment, challenging the constitutionality of his trial to the court and the sufficiency of the evidence. The court affirmed appellant's conviction. The court held that appellant was not denied his right to compulsory process nor was it fundamental error for the trial court to have conducted a bench trial under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.15. While appellant waived his right to a jury trial, appellant presented a defense, testified, and cross-examined the state's witnesses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee family, acting as next of friend of a resident of appellant nursing home, filed suit against appellant alleging negligence and gross negligence in its care for the resident. A jury found in favor of appellee and awarded appellee $ 380,000 in damages and $ 850,000 in punitive damages. Appellant challenged the finding of gross negligence and the punitive damages award. The court held that the evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury's finding that appellant was guilty of gross negligence within the definition of the landmark opinion of the state. Specifically, appellant's knowing violation of its own policies, its failure to comply with the Nurse Practice Act, its apparent falsification of records, and disregard for doctor's orders constituted more than a scintilla of evidence of its conscious disregard for the risk of serious harm to the resident. The court further held that the trial court's failure to conduct a hearing on appellant's post-verdict motions or to articulate its findings did not deprive appellant of due process because adequate post-verdict review of punitive damages was available at the appellate level. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the jury assessed punishment at imprisonment for 40 years. After sentencing, appellant sought review, contending the trial court erroneously included a parole instruction in the jury charge.

Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 110.002-.003 (1996) pursuant to a medical malpractice settlement between the insured and the claimant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator insurer settled a medical malpractice suit filed against its insured by a claimant. Pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; &sect;110.002-.003, relator requested indemnification from the state, and the state refused. Relator filed suit. The trial court sustained the state's objection, and relator sought a writ of mandamus to set aside the order. The state claimed that the statute did not apply because the claimant's action accrued prior to its effective date. The court held that the statute was governed by the Medical Liability Act, which contained an absolute two-year limitation period. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (1996). However, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, precluded the application of the strict accrual date because it was impossible for claimant to discover his injury within that time. The court applied the discovery rule and held that the action accrued after the indemnification statute's effective date. Relator qualified for indemnification, and the settlement amount governed the indemnity amount. The court conditionally granted mandamus directing the trial court to vacate its order and to render an order directing the state to indemnify relator.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant niece sought review of a judgment from the 270th District Court, Harris County (Texas), determining that decedent's will excluded her as a descendant and finding in favor of appellee college as beneficiary under decedent's will.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent's will created a testamentary trust naming two of his sisters-in-law as beneficiaries that would terminate upon the beneficiaries' death and pass to their descendants. If there were no descendants, the trust property would pass to appellee college. Both beneficiaries survived decedent; however, one beneficiary adopted appellant niece as an adult after decedent died. Appellant sought review after the lower court excluded her as a descendant under the testamentary trust provisions. The court found that the testator's intent was paramount, construed by the laws in effect at the time of the testator's death. Under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 46a, &sect; 9 (repealed), in effect at decedent's death, an adopted child was not entitled to property conveyed to the natural child of the adoptive parent unless the intent to include was indicated by additional language or circumstances. As an attorney, decedent was presumed to understand the effect of the law at the time he wrote the will. Further, adoption of adults was not recognized in Texas until after his death. Because the will unambiguously did not include adopted children as descendants, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment that appellant niece, as an adopted child, was not descendant of decedent and was not entitled to a share of a testamentary trust created to benefit his descendants was affirmed. Decedent did not included adopted children as descendants as required by statute in effect at the time he wrote his will. The law also did not recognize adult adoptees. Defendant's intent was construed to exclude appellant as a descendant.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that his sentence was excessive, and that it was error for the judge to review a presentence report prior to finding him guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction in the trial court upon his plea of guilt to the offense of the possession of opium with intent to deliver, and the resultant sentence of 15 years' confinement and a fine, and asserted that his sentence violated the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and that appellant's conviction was void because the trial court reviewed a presentence report prior to an adjudication of guilt. The court affirmed and found that pursuant to Tex.

The court held that although a trial judge should not examine a presentence report prior to the adjudication of guilt pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, 9(c)(1) (Supp. 1996), because appellant pled guilty to the charge prior to the trial court's examination of the report, the trial court could not be influenced by it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a trial court order, revoking probation and adjudicating guilt on the grounds that the trial court erred due to fatal variance and insufficient evidence.

Appellant pleaded guilty without an agreed recommendation to the offense of burglary of a habitation. Appellant also pleaded true to enhancement for a prior aggravated assault conviction. The trial court placed appellant on 10 years' deferred adjudication with community supervision. A judgment of guilt on the charged offense was rendered, which revoked appellant's community supervision, and gave him a 20-year sentence. On appeal, the court declined to address points of error regarding the adjudication of guilt, because a defendant could not appeal a court's decision to adjudicate guilt. Based on precedent, the court held that art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b) did not violate appellant's equal protection rights.

Appellant alleged, inter alia, the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of the cocaine and denying his Batson challenge. Appellant challenged constitutionality of Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of conviction of possession of a controlled substance. Appellant alleged the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence because cocaine was obtained in a search incident to an illegal arrest. The appellate court concluded that in reviewing a warrantless arrest, whether probable cause existed was determined by applying the totality of the circumstances test. Searches incident to an arrest were not limited to those made at the instant a suspect was taken into police custody. When booked into a detention facility, a suspect may be searched without a warrant. The arrest and the search were lawful, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion to suppress the cocaine When reviewing the trial court's determination of a Batson challenge, the appellate court applied the clear error standard of review, which required deference to the trial court's finding on the prosecution's discriminatory intent. Nevertheless, the appellate court determined whether the decision of the trial court was clearly erroneous by looking at the record, including voir dire, racial makeup of the venire, and the prosecution's explanations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had been detained in a mental health facility against his will and brought suit against the mental health department and the state asserting a number of causes of actions. Prior to bringing suit, he had filed an action in federal court alleging the detention had violated his federal constitutional rights, which action was dismissed. The appellees sought summary judgment in the subsequent state court action, based on statute of limitations, which was granted. The court affirmed and held that Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 16.064 did not toll the statute of limitations while appellant's suit was pending in federal court. Appellees, on summary judgment had to show that either the federal court case had been dismissed for want of jurisdiction, or that the two causes of action were not the same. The court held that although the federal court case had been dismissed for want of jurisdiction, the two causes of action were not the same, since appellant could not have claimed federal constitutional rights' violations in state court and had not added his state court causes of action to his federal court case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the 158th District Court, Denton County (Texas), that convicted him of aggravated sexual assault, asserting that his speedy trial right was violated and that he should have been granted a change of venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a retrial, defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault. Defendant appealed. The prosecution conceded that the delay in defendant's retrial was long enough to be presumed prejudicial, and failed to provide a valid reason for the delay. Defendant established that his defense was impaired by the delay because by the time his trial was held, other convictions had been entered against him that were considered by the jury; the prosecution thus failed to prove defendant suffered no prejudice by the delay. Despite this evidence, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that defendant's speedy trial right was not violated as there was proof that defendant did not immediately request a speedy trial, and requested dismissal rather than an accelerated trial. The court rejected defendant's claim that he was entitled to a change of venue based on the prosecution's failure to timely file counter-affidavits because the prosecution was not required to file the affidavits seven days before the hearing on the motion under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.01 (1989). Defendant's conviction was therefore affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction of aggravated sexual assault was affirmed because the trial court properly applied a balancing test and did not abuse its discretion in finding defendant's speedy trial right was not violated. Further, defendant was not entitled to a change of venue as there were no time requirements with respect to the prosecution's counter-affidavits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the 144th District Court of Bexar County (Texas), which, after a jury trial, convicted him of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, appellant was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Appellant challenged his conviction, claiming that the trial court erred by charging the jury with respect to parole law during the punishment phase of his trial. Because appellant's objection to the charge on appeal differed from that at trial, the court reviewed the claim as an unobjected-to error. Thus, although the trial court's misstatement that appellant, for good behavior, could earn time off his sentence was error as Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4a (1996) referred to time off the period of incarceration, the court held that appellant failed to demonstrate actual egregious harm as a result of the misstatement. In so ruling, the court noted that there was no indication that the jury was influenced by the charge. The court held that the grand jury indictment did not violate Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, because no additional investigation could have determined the exact manner or means of the victim's death. The court also held that the evidence was legally sufficient to support the conviction, which the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for murder, because he did not demonstrate egregious harm as a result of the trial court's misstatement on parole law, the grand jury could not have determined through additional investigation the exact manner or means of the victim's death, and the evidence was legally sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court awarded appellee class of payors actual damages based on a four-year statute of limitations with prejudgment interest and a statutory penalty as damages against appellants, sheriff and county, for the unauthorized collection of pre-conviction bail bond approval fees. On review sought by appellants, the court affirmed the portion of the order awarding actual damages because appellants were liable jointly and severally for a refund of the collected amount of unauthorized fees. Appellants were not entitled to legislative or governmental immunity, because the taking for the purpose of providing services affecting the public interest was incident to a public use under Tex. Const. art I, &sect; 17. The court reversed the portion of the order that applied a four-year statute of limitations because the two-year period for a taking of personal property should have been used. The court remanded for a recalculation of the prejudgment interest based on the two-year statute of limitations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee tire owners alleged injuries caused by a defect in appellant tire manufacturer's tires which contributed to vehicle rollover. After the trial court dismissed the suit, it granted appellees' motion for relief from a protective order and denied appellant's motion to seal. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed, because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in applying Tex. R. Civ. P. 76a to appellant's request for limited protection of court records rather than Tex. R. Civ. P. 166b. The court held that appellees carried their burden of proving that documents produced during discovery concerned the failure rate of appellant's tires which had a probable adverse effect on the general public health or safety. Appellant failed to rebut the presumption of openness with evidence of its interest in protecting its trade secrets. The court found that the notice of a rule 76a hearing was sufficient to confer jurisdiction over court records produced during an earlier suit with a different plaintiff who was represented by appellees' counsel. The court held that the terms of rule 76a were fairly limited and not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient and wife sought review of decision by the 129th District Court of Harris County (Texas), which granted appellee doctor's motion for summary judgment dismissing the malpractice claim against him because it was barred by the statute of limitations in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i (1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient and wife claimed that appellee doctor negligently failed to diagnose cancer when appellant patient was examined by the doctor for rectal bleeding. Appellants claimed that the negligence was the proximate cause of damages that would have been prevented if the doctor had made a proper diagnosis or referral. The trial court granted summary judgment dismissing the case because appellee examined the patient on only one occasion in May 1991. Appellants' first lawyer sent a notice of claim to appellee in August 1992, but the lawsuit was not filed until July 1994, more than three years after the examination. On appeal, the court affirmed. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i (1996), provides a two year statute of limitations for medical malpractice actions and excludes such cases from the Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. &sect; 17.41 et seq. (1996). In addition, there was no evidence of fraudulent concealment in the record that might have tolled the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed because the summary judgment proof established that the action was filed more than three years after the examination which was the basis of the claim and the statute of limitations for medical malpractice is two years. Since there was no evidence of fraud and the law precluded a deceptive trade action the action was time barred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision of the 144th District Court of Bexar County (Texas), which found him guilty of murder and sentenced him to 18 years imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was indicted for murder, found guilty, and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment. Appellant claimed the trial court erred at the punishment phase in not allowing him to describe his girlfriend's personality traits and the events precipitating the assault on his girlfriend a few days prior to the murder. The court overruled appellant holding that there was not sufficient evidence in the record to indicate that appellant's assault on his girlfriend had any bearing on the murder. Appellant complained that the trial court wrongfully instructed the jury that good behavior could reduce the time of his sentence rather than his period of incarceration. The court held that appellant did not properly object to the charge nor did he suffer any egregious harm. The court further held that since appellant was tried for this offense after the effective reenactment of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, which allowed such an instruction to be given to the jury, the parole instruction was constitutional. The court found that the jury was not unduly swayed by the parole charge because appellant's sentence was only three years more than the minimum punishment of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the 18-year sentence concluding that there was not sufficient evidence in the record to show that appellant's assault on his girlfriend had any bearing on the murder. The court held that appellant did not properly object to the jury instruction that good behavior could reduce the time of his sentence, nor did he suffer egregious harm since such an instruction was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-husband challenged the final order of the 77th District Court, Limestone County (Texas) granting appellee ex-wife a permanent turnover for collection of a judgment and sanctions under Tex. R. Civ. P. 13. The appeal arose out of appellee's successful suit for breach and anticipatory repudiation of an alimony contract and subsequent motion for an ex parte temporary turnover order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-husband sought reversal of an order granting appellee ex-wife a permanent turnover for collection of a judgment and sanctions. Appellee had earlier filed suit for breach of an alimony contract and later sought a turnover under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code &sect; 31.000 (1986) alleging that the awarded judgment was past due and owing. The court reversed the order of sanctions under Tex. R. Civ. P. 13 finding the lower court abused its discretion by not stating the particulars of good cause required by the statute. In all other regards the court overruled appellant's numerous points of error and affirmed the grant of permanent turnover. The court held that appellant was given proper notice and afforded due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 during the ex parte temporary order. Appellant was found to have waived his right to a jury trial under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 by not timely filing a request. The court found appellant's property subject to turnover was clearly described and the lower court showed no abuse of discretion in either awarding appellee attorney fees or in allowing her to withdraw funds deposited in the court's registry.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the final order granting appellee ex-wife a permanent turnover for collection of a judgment from appellant ex-husband, overruling appellant's points of error and finding proper exercise of the turnover statute with no constitutional or procedural violations. The court reversed the order for sanctions against appellant because the trial court failed to state the particulars of good cause for the imposition of sanctions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to burglary of a habitation, under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.02 (1989). The trial court assessed punishment, enhanced by two prior convictions, at 25 years in prison. Challenging the decision, appellant contended the trial court erred by denying his motion to quash the enhancement paragraphs in his indictment. Prior to the burglary offense he was convicted of criminal mischief and of burglary of a building. Appellant argued that his prior conviction for criminal mischief was void because the indictment failed to include a necessary mens rea and the indictment was void because the underlying statute was unconstitutionally vague. Reviewing the record, the court found that the criminal mischief statute did not include a separate mens rea. Appellant had signed a written waiver of his constitutional rights in open court, while represented by counsel, in accordance with Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 1.15 . The waiver specifically referred to the underlying statute so that any ambiguity was cleared. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the trial court did not err by overruling appellant's motion to quash the enhancement paragraphs.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that a witness' reference to an extraneous offense committed by appellant was not reversible error because it was indirect and was cured by an instruction to disregard the statement.

Appellant suspended appellee's license to practice medicine, and appellee sought the trial court's review.

Further, where appellee's assertion that &sect; 431.183(a)(2) was unconstitutional was based upon appellant's finding that appellee's brochures constituted false advertising, because appellee was involved in an illegal activity, his brochures were not entitled to protection under U.S. Const. amend.

Appellant also argued that the evidence against him was insufficient to corroborate the promise of remuneration and that a photo entered into evidence and shown to the jury was overly prejudicial. On review, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the statements were admissible as an exception to hearsay, as they were self-inculpatory and against the declarants' penal interest that a reasonable person in the declarants' position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true and that appellee State provided evidence of corroborating circumstances sufficiently convincing to clearly indicate the trustworthiness of said statements. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to establish remuneration and that the photo was relevant and not overly prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, patient and husband, sought review of the summary judgment granted by the 348th District Court of Tarrant County (Texas) in favor of appellee health care providers because appellants' claims were barred by the statute of limitations. Appellants argued that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing their lawsuit because the open courts provision, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, saved their claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient was treated by appellee health care providers seven years before she sued them for a misdiagnosis. Appellant husband sued on derivative claims. Appellants had learned of the misdiagnosis six years after the treatment by appellees. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees because appellants' claims were barred by the two-year statute of limitations imposed by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. Art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01. On appeal, the court held that, under the statute of limitations, the lawsuit was barred. Under the open courts provision, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, they had a reasonable time after they learned of the misdiagnosis to bring their lawsuit even though it was past the limitations period because it was inherently impossible for them to file suit before they learned of the misdiagnosis. The reasonable time was not equivalent to another limitations period. Without explanation for the delay, they failed to sue for more than a year after learning of the misdiagnosis. As a matter of law they did not bring their lawsuit within a reasonable time and, therefore, were not entitled to relief from the open courts provision. Summary judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellees also argued that certain of the trial court's findings of fact were improper as relating to the merits of the case. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that exercise of jurisdiction over appellee did not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice and that the trial court could properly assert general jurisdiction over appellee.

The court affirmed the judgments but reformed them by deleting certain conditions of community supervision.

The court reviewed sealed records and found that they did not include exculpatory evidence. The failure of the trial court to release other records to defendant in order to impeach a witness or find exculpatory evidence was harmless error because the records were consistent with the witness' trial testimony and cumulative. The trial court erred in requiring defendant to not contest extradition to Texas and requiring defendant to pay the victim's therapy and medical costs, but because state conceded these points, the court did not address the merits. The trial court erred in requiring defendant to contribute to a counseling fund because it was not authorized by law, and in requiring that defendant pay a fine within 10 days because the trial court never made an inquiry into defendant's ability to pay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant mother filed for divorce she became aware that her husband, appellee presumed father, was not the biological father of her minor child.

The trial court struck the amended pleading and the intervention and granted a continuance. After the trial court awarded appellee sole managing conservatorship of the child, appellants sought review. As soon as appellant biological father suspected that he might be the father, he acknowledged responsibility for the child's care and maintenance and made serious and continuous efforts to establish a relationship with the child. The court found that this was sufficient to give appellant biological father standing to file a paternity suit, and that the trial court abused its discretion in striking his intervention. The court found that although appellee would have been surprised by the amended pleadings, there was no showing that the continuance did not cure the surprise.

Tax Code Ann. &sect; 42.08(b) (1992) was unconstitutional as applied to appellee taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, tax appraiser and appraisal review board, appraised nine parcels of property owned by appellee taxpayers. Appellants received a protest from appellees in return, arguing that the property valuations were too high under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 41.44(a) (1992). Appellants lowered the appraised value on the properties, but the values were still not as low as appellees claimed they should have been, and appellees brought a suit for de novo review, without paying the taxes. Although Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 42.08 required forfeiture of the claim in this circumstance, the trial court rendered judgment for appellees. Appellants challenged this decision. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 42.08 clearly created a financial barrier to access to the courts by requiring that a taxpayer pay the appropriate amount of taxes before the delinquency date or forfeit the right to obtain a final determination from the reviewing court. Because of this the court held that &sect; 42.08 violated Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, the open courts provision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction of aggravated sexual assault and indecency with a child in the 226th Judicial Court of Bexar County (Texas) He claimed that the trial court erred in admitting and excluding certain evidence at his sentencing. He claimed fundamental error arising out of the state's references to hardships endured by the jury, the state, and the state's witnesses as a result of his exercising his right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual assault and indecency with a child, he was sentenced to prison. The court affirmed the trial court, holding that it did not err in refusing to permit appellant to cross-examine the victim's mother about other sexual offenses against the victim by other perpetrators in order to show that the victim's emotional problems were not caused exclusively by appellant's conduct. The court reasoned that some of the testimony was inadmissible hearsay and that some of it was excluded by the trial judge, acting within his discretion, as irrelevant. The court also held that the trial court did not err in admitting the videotape appellant made of his offense, holding that the tape was prejudicial but not unfairly prejudicial and that the trial judge acted within his discretion in admitting it. The court found neither error nor egregious harm in the state's references to hardships on the jury, the state and the state's witnesses. The court held that they were not directed at appellant's exercise of his right to a jury trial but that they recognized the painful nature of the case for all and sought to meet appellant's closing argument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that judgment of the trial court, holding that the trial court did not err in excluding certain evidence at appellant's sentencing, because some of it was hearsay and some of it was irrelevant. It did not err in admitting a videotape, because the tape was not unfairly prejudicial. The state's references to hardships were not directed at appellant's exercise of his right to trial by jury and did not cause fundamental error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employees' positions were abolished when defendant employer reorganized. Claiming a right to continued employment and that the reorganization was only a pretext for discharging them because of their age or sex, plaintiffs brought an action against defendant to recover compensatory damages for discrimination, declaratory relief, and attorney's fees. The trial court awarded compensatory damages to one plaintiff, declaratory relief to one plaintiff for deprivation of property without due process of law, and attorney's fees to all plaintiffs. On appeal, the court affirmed the award of compensatory damages to one plaintiff and reversed as to another plaintiff, holding that the trial court erred as a matter of law in awarding one plaintiff declaratory relief for deprivation of property without due process of law because the evidence did not show that she was deprived of a property interest. The court also held that the trial judge abused his discretion in awarding all plaintiffs attorney's fees, holding that the trial court lacked the power, hence the discretion, to award attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for unlawful carrying of a weapon. The court found that the prosecution against appellant did not have to be dismissed with prejudice under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32.01 because that provision did not apply to county courts. The court also determined that appellant waived his complaint that the trial judge was biased because appellant failed to file a timely motion for recusal. The court concluded that appellant was not entitled to a jury charge instruction on the defense of traveling because appellant was not in the course of travel when he was apprehended and that the exception in the statute for traveling was not so unclear as to be void. Furthermore, appellant was found to have made a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel after being advised of the risks of doing so, and that there was no requirement that such waiver be in writing. The court found no basis to conclude that the mere failure of a police officer and a justice of the peace to submit written statements, when the oaths of office themselves have been taken, rendered the oaths invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the denial of his application for writ of habeas corpus from the County Criminal Court at Law Number Seven, Harris County (Texas), raising the issue of whether an administrative suspension of a driver's license for failing a breath test constituted a bar to prosecution for driving while intoxicated on the basis of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following appellant's administrative driver's license suspension for failing a breath test, the state filed an information against appellant for driving while intoxicated (DWI). Appellant filed an application for writ of habeas corpus, requesting a double jeopardy bar of his DWI prosecution on the ground that he was punished by the driver's license suspension. The trial court denied relief and appellant sought review therefrom. The court affirmed the denial of the application, holding that the administrative suspension of appellant's driver's license for failing a breath test did not constitute a bar to prosecution for DWI. The court explained that generally a civil sanction that was partly remedial and partly deterrent was a jeopardy bar. Despite the court's finding that the suspension statute was punitive based on the legislative history and the statute's focus on criminal culpability, the driver's license suspension was not a double jeopardy bar because it was designed to constitute rough remedial justice and its effect was not exponentially greater than the amount of the damages caused. Rather, the court viewed the license suspension as a measured and appropriate response.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied appellant's application for writ of habeas corpus complaining of violation of his right to a speedy trial and the state's failure to present an indictment against him in the next term of court after his commitment or admission to bail in violation of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32.01 (1989). The hearing on appellant's petition for writ of habeas corpus was held before the judge of the 239th District Court, rather than the 23rd District Court where the indictment was filed. The trial court reasoned that, although two terms of the 23rd District Court had passed, the term of the 239th District Court was controlling, and a second term of that court had not passed from the time of arrest to the time of indictment. On appeal, the court held that because the relevant time period under art. 32.01 was from arrest to indictment, the term of the court in which the case was pending during that period, the 23rd District Court, should control. Accordingly, because the second term of the 23rd court passed before appellant was indicted, the indictment was not timely for purposes of art. 32.01. The court sustained appellant's point of error, reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the denial below of appellant's application for writ of habeas corpus, finding that two terms of the court had expired before appellant was indicted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, in her capacities as executrix, individually, and as next friend of deceased son, sought review of the summary judgment rendered in the 319th District Court of Nueces County (Texas) in favor of appellee doctor who asserted the defense of limitations to appellant's survival and wrongful death actions based on appellee's malpractice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee doctor treated decedent for Hodgkin's Disease with Cytoxan. Decedent began to excrete blood in his urine while he was on vacation, and was advised by a different doctor that extended use of Cytoxan had caused his bladder to bleed. Over the course of treatment for the bleeding from his bladder and urinary tract, decedent was intermittently hospitalized from 1984 until his death in 1992, and was led to believe that his condition was a curable effect of the Cytoxan and consequently declined to bring suit. Decedent's bladder cancer was first detected when a new doctor recommended reconstructive bladder surgery in 1991. Appellant as executrix, individually, and as next friend decided to sue appellee for negligence in the course of treatment when the terminal cancer was discovered, but no action was filed until a year after decedent's death. The court held that appellee did not demonstrate that he was entitled to summary judgment because there was an issue of material fact as to whether the urinary tract bleeding was part of the cancer, or whether it was merely a minor, curable side-effect of treatment with Cytoxan, and the bladder cancer was a separate and distinct injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment against appellant individually and as executrix, but reversed the summary judgment and remanded the action asserted by appellant as next friend, holding that appellee doctor's proof was inadequate to establish that the statute of limitations barred appellant's claim that the open courts provision and application of the discovery rule could have been invoked in the malpractice suit against appellee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for engaging in organized criminal activity and the jury assessed punishment of confinement for 40 years and a fine, entered in the 371st District Court of Tarrant County (Texas), pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 71.02 (1994 &amp; Supp. 1996). Defendant contended various errors, including constitutionality of the statute, and error in admission of accomplice testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a member of a skinhead group. He and some friends decided to engage in a drive-by shooting. Driving through town they drove by an African-American male, turned the car around, drove by again and shot at him. A witness identified the car license plate, and defendant was arrested, indicted, and convicted of engaging in organized criminal activity, under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 71.02 (1994 &amp; Supp. 1996). He appealed his conviction and 40-year sentence and argued nineteen points of error. The court affirmed and held that defendant had failed to show the trial court erred in any of his claims, that defendant had failed to properly preserve error, that the statute under which defendant was prosecuted was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad, and that the trial court had properly admitted evidence that went to the combination and motive of the conspiracy. The court further held that the accomplice witness testimony was sufficiently corroborated, and that defendant was not entitled to an instruction on the lesser-included offense of tampering with evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of organized criminal activity and sentence, and held that defendant had failed to show that the trial court erred on any of the 19 points he raised on appeal. The court held that the statute was not vague or overbroad and was therefore constitutional, and that accomplice testimony had been adequately corroborated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the 337th District Court, Harris County (Texas), convicting him of aggravated robbery and sentencing him as a second offender to 50 years in prison, on grounds that his sentence was cruel and unusual under U.S. Const. amends. VIII, XIV, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, that his presentence report was reviewed prior to a determination of his guilt in error, and that he was denied compulsory process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to aggravated robbery and was sentenced as a second offender to 50 years in prison. He appealed on grounds that the sentence was cruel and unusual. Under Tex. Penal Code &sect; 12.42(c), defendant was subject to a prison term of no more than 99 years or less than 15 years. The punishment was not cruel or unusual under state or federal constitutions because it was within statutory limits. Defendant's conviction was not void because the lower court did not review his presentence report before determining guilt. Defendant had already pled guilty and did not object to review of the report before his guilt was pronounced. Defendant argued that his right to compulsory process was denied. The court noted that under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.15 (Supp. 1996) (art. 1.15), the state had to produce evidence of defendant's guilt if defendant pled guilty and waived the right to a jury trial. Defendant did not offer evidence, and art. 1.15 did not prevent him from doing so. Defendant did not have to expressly waive his right to compulsory process, but his express waiver of other rights effectively waived his compulsory process right. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for aggravated robbery and his sentence to 50 years in prison as a second offender was affirmed. Defendant's sentence was within statutory limits; thus, the punishment was not cruel and unusual under either state or federal constitutions. The lower court's review of his presentence report occurred after defendant had pled guilty. Defendant effectively waived his right to compulsory process, but was not denied this right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county water conservation district sought review of a judgment of the 238th District Court of Midland County (Texas), which determined that appellant did not have the right to tax severed mineral estates underlying land in another county that surface owners had annexed into appellant's district from appellees, appraisers and appraisal district, pursuant to 1989 Tex. Sess. Law Serv. 2159 or Tex. Water Code Ann. &sect; 52.521 (Supp. 1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Texas legislature enacted 1989 Tex. Sess. Law Serv. 2159, which allowed county landowners to petition to annex their land into appellant county water conservation district. Owners of land in adjoining water district could also annex their land into appellant's district by petitioning for exclusion from the adjoining district, and then petitioning for annexation into appellant's district under Tex. Water Code Ann. &sect; 52.521 (Supp. 1996). Owners of surface estates filed petitions under each of the statutes, but the owners of severed mineral estates under those surface estates did not. Appellees, appraisers and appraisal district, prepared tax rolls for appellant's county that included the value of the surface estates, but not of the severed mineral estates. Appellant sued for a declaration that the severed mineral estates should have been included on the tax rolls for its county. After holding that there was no administrative remedy for appellant to exhaust, the court affirmed a trial court declaration that the severed mineral estates were not annexed into appellant's county. The statutes limited the effect of an owner's petition to the estate that the petitioner actually owned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed for appellees, appraisers and appraisal district. The statutes gave each owner of an estate in a county the right to petition for annexation of that estate into appellant county water conservation district, and appellant could only tax those estates that chose annexation into its district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While appellee was incarcerated for two murder convictions, he killed a fellow inmate. Appellant state indicted appellee for capital murder based on the aggravating factor of his two previous convictions. The trial court granted appellee's motion to quash the aggravating portions of the indictment and appellant sought review, contending that the trial court erred in its ruling. The court noted that the indictment alleged all the requirements to properly elevate appellee's offense from murder to capital murder pursuant to the Capital Murder Statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(6). Appellee argued that applying &sect; 19.03 to his case violated the ex post facto prohibition. The court disagreed because at the time appellee murdered his fellow inmate, the act was punishable under &sect; 19.03 and the statute did not retroactively impose a greater punishment that that already prescribed on the date of the crime. The court also rejected appellee's argument that the statute was unconstitutional. The court reversed the order of the trial court quashing the indictment and remanded the cause to the trial court for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee challenged an order of the 158th District Court of Denton County (Texas) that dismissed his common law claim for unpaid wages against appellee employer. Appellant alleged that the trial court erred in deciding that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, and erred in interpreting the Payday Law, Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 61.001 et seq. (1996), as providing a mandatory and exclusive remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee brought a common law claim against appellee employer to recover a debt for unpaid wages after having brought a statutory claim therefor against appellee under the Payday Law, Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 61.001 et seq. (1996), before the Texas Employment Commission. The court reversed the dismissal order entered by the trial court against appellant's common law claim and remanded the matter for a trial. The trial court erred by granting the dismissal because appellant's Payday Law claim did not pre-empt subject matter jurisdiction over appellant's common law claim. The court held that appellant's common law claim was not purely statutory because the Payday Law did not provide a reasonable substitute for the remedy of a jury trial, which was a constitutional right. The court found that the Payday Law did not repeal the common law remedy, but rather provided an alternative means to recover the debt. Therefore, the court determined that an interpretation of the Payday Law as the mandatory and exclusive remedy would be unconstitutional. Appellant could proceed to trial because he had withdrawn his administrative Payday Law claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that dismissed appellant employee's common law claim for unpaid wages against appellee employer because the trial court properly had subject matter jurisdiction, for the Payday Law that did not repeal the common law remedy, and remanded the matter for trial because appellant had a constitutional right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

Proc. Ann. art. 38.23(b) (Supp. 1995) for three reasons. First, the evidence was seized in good faith. Second, the warrant was issued by a neutral magistrate under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 2.09 (Supp. 1995). Third, the warrant was based on probable cause. Therefore, the evidence seized pursuant to the invalid warrant's execution was admissible despite any violation of the federal and state constitutions. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting a photograph under Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 403 because it was not exceedingly gruesome.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, tenant and guests, challenged a trial judge's order granting appellee builder summary judgment in appellants' negligent construction lawsuit. The court reversed and remanded. Appellants had sued appellee after the deck on which they wee standing collapsed, asserting that appellee had negligently constructed the deck out of untreated lumber. Appellee responded that because it had constructed the deck over 10 years before suit was filed, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 16.009 deemed it not liable. Appellants retorted that the fraudulent concealment and willful misconduct exceptions to the 10-year statutory repose period applied. The court, in reversing the trial judge's summary judgment ruling favoring appellee, held that although appellee had conclusively established that it had built the deck over 10 years before it was sued, it had not conclusively defeated appellants' willful misconduct averment. Because a factual dispute related to appellants' willful misconduct argument existed, summary judgment was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee trustee was appointed to administer the bankruptcy estate of a bail bondsman. Appellee filed suit against appellant sheriff and appellant county challenging two different bail bond processing fees levied by the county commissioner's court, and sought four times that sum as a penalty, prejudgment interest, costs of court, and attorneys fees. Appellants filed an equitable setoff claim in response. The lower court rendered judgment against appellants and found them to be jointly and severally liable for damages, costs, attorney's fees, and prejudgment interest. Appellant sheriff was found separately liable for additional damages and prejudgment interest. The court reversed and rendered a take-nothing judgment in appellant sheriff's favor on one bond fee issue because it held that appellant sheriff had legislative immunity from liability for authorized acts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2) (1994), under a conspiracy theory, after he and an accomplice stabbed a young boy during an attempted robbery. Appellant challenged the conviction arguing that the trial court erred by submitting an instruction to the jury that authorized the jury to convict appellant of capital murder without any requirement of intent. The court affirmed, finding that the law of parties under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 7.02(b) (1994) eliminated any necessity on the part of the state to prove that the appellant had any intent to kill the boy. To convict under &sect; 7.02(b), the state only had to show that appellant conspired with others to commit an aggravated robbery, that one of his coconspirators intentionally caused the death in the course of committing or attempting to commit the aggravated robbery, and that appellant should have anticipated the result. The court also found that the &sect; 7.02(b) instruction did not implicate U.S. Const. amends. VIII and XIV and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, because this was not a death penalty case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

The court found that the instruction authorizing the jury to convict appellant of capital murder without the requirement of intent was valid, because the intent of his coconspirator was imputed to him under the law of parties, since the murder was a foreseeable result of the aggravated robbery.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court properly admitted evidence of an extraneous hot check transaction that occurred after the charged offense, because the offense was similar and showed both identity and intent, which appellant had placed at issue with a &quot;not guilty&quot; plea. The court found that the evidence was not so compelling under Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 403 as to affect the trial court's ability to disregard the evidence for any but its proper purpose. The court found that appellant's sentence did not violate his U.S. Const. amends.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his sentence and conviction from the 291st Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas) for possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress narcotics found on his person and by assessing punishment in excess of the statutory maximum for a state jail felony under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.112(b) (1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his sentence and conviction for possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court first rejected defendant's claim that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress narcotics found on his person after a search incident to arrest. Specifically, defendant claimed that the arresting officers did not have adequate facts in their possession to justify a temporary investigative detention and that, therefore, the narcotics were improperly admitted into evidence. The court ruled that defendant's odd conduct, that of dancing in the street, coupled with the officers' observation of him holding what appeared to be a crack pipe, provided the officers with reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop. The court then rejected defendant's claim that he should have been sentenced to state jail under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.112(b) (1996), as amended, because he was sentenced after the statute was amended. The court ruled that he was properly sentenced under the statute as it read when the offense occurred and that such a sentence did not violate his equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged his conviction, contending that the officers' initial detention was unconstitutional. Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court ruled that law enforcement officers may stop and briefly detain persons suspected of criminal activity on less information than is constitutionally required for a probable cause to arrest. The court held that the officers had reasonable suspicion that some activity out of the ordinary had occurred or was occurring, and that there was some suggestion to connect appellant with the unusual activity and some indication that the activity was related to a crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant family sued appellee hospital and delivering doctor for negligent credentialing and medical malpractice for injuries sustained by their son during his birth. The trial court granted appellees summary judgment and severed the two actions. Appellant sought review of the negligent credentialing action, and argued that trial court incorrectly interpreted the Texas Medical Practice Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. ann. Art. 4495b 1.01-6.13 (1995), as requiring patients to prove malice in actions against hospitals. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court reviewed the Act in its entirety. The court reasoned that, if interpreted as the trial court did, the Act would require injured patients to prove malice without benefit of discovery. The court held that such an interpretation would make the Act internally contradictory. The court found that the legislative history of the Act stated that immunity was never meant to cover injured patients, and held that sustaining the judgment would deny appellants a meaningful or effective remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the order granting summary judgment because the court determined that appellant hospital could not be permitted to require proof of malice in a negligent credentialing claim by an injured patient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who worked at an adult video store, was convicted of promotion of obscenity, pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(c)(1), after recommending pornographic tapes to undercover police officers. Appellant sought review of his conviction, claiming that the obscenity statute was unconstitutional because it violated his free speech rights under Tex. Const. art I, &sect; 8. Appellant further argued that the evidence to sustain his conviction was insufficient to show that he knew the nature and content of the videotapes alleged to be obscene. The court sustained appellant's conviction, holding that obscenity was not protected speech under Tex. Const. art I, &sect; 8, and that in any event appellant did not argue the constitutionality of the obscenity statute during trial, and therefore the argument could not be raised for the first time on appeal unless the obscenity statute was facially unconstitutional. The court also ruled that there was sufficient evidence to sustain appellant's conviction. The boxes to the videotapes that appellant recommended to the police officers suggested sexual content, and appellant could be convicted on such circumstantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the petition, ordered relator released on bond, and heard oral arguments. In his petition, relator contended that the district court's order was void because it violated the double jeopardy provisions of the United States and Texas Constitutions, the criminal court erred by imposing criminal penalties for acts not proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 14.40(g) was unconstitutional as applied in criminal contempt proceedings because it violated the due process clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. After overruling all of relator's contentions, the court declined to grant the writ of habeas corpus.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant judgment debtor sought habeas corpus relief. The district court, Travis County (Texas) had held him in contempt and committed him to jail for failure to comply with an order that was entered pursuant to Texas Turnover Statute,&nbsp;Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 31.002(a) (1986) (Supp. 1995). The order issued based on appellant's nonpayment of an agreed judgment. Judgment creditor moved for contempt for appellant's failure to pay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant judgment debtor sought habeas corpus relief after he had been held in contempt and jailed on the contempt motion of judgment creditor for appellant's failure to comply with an order under the Texas Turnover Statute,&nbsp;Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 31.002(a) (1986) (Supp. 1995). Judgment creditor had sued appellant for fraud and had won an agreed judgment of a certain sum. Appellant failed to pay under the judgment. Judgment creditor then sought a turnover order, which was granted after a hearing, whereby appellant was ordered to turn over to the court clerk set monthly payments until the judgment was satisfied. The order identified no specific property or property rights. Judgment creditor moved for contempt, as appellant never made a payment. The court discharged appellant on grounds that he had no existing nonexempt property or future rights to any such nonexempt property. Thus the turnover order was error, as it attempted to collect a judgment from property that did not yet exist, and could have been exempt from a turnover order if it had existed, and the order resulted in an unconstitutional imprisonment for debt in violation of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that as the succeessor's executrix, appellee was a proper party to the lawsuit. The court also held that the parties' contract was not rendered ambiguous because of a variable interest rate. The court further found that the financial agreement did not contain a condition precedent. The court held that a commission had primary jurisdiction to determine the interest rate because it was authorized by state statute. The court also held that the trial court erred by concluding that the commission's determination of a lump sum was not a lower interest rate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following knee replacement and revision surgeries by appellee doctor, appellant's right leg was amputated below the knee. Appellant sued appellee for medical malpractice. Regarding the knee replacement surgery, the jury found that appellant brought suit beyond the limitations period of the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01. As to the revision surgery, the jury found that appellee was not liable for lack of informed consent, misrepresentation, negligence, gross negligence, and damages. The trial court entered judgment accordingly. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the Act's statute of limitations barred appellant's first suit because it was not filed within two years of the date of the knee replacement surgery. With respect to the revision surgery, the judgment was affirmed because appellee fully disclosed the risks of the surgery and appellant gave her informed consent. Moreover, there was sufficient evidence that appellee's use of a tourniquet during the surgery was within reasonable medical standards.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his convictions by the 167th Judicial District Court, Travis County (Texas), for possession of a controlled substance, psilocybin, in an amount less than 28 grams and for possession of a controlled substance, cocaine, in an amount less than 28 grams.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When police officers entered appellant's apartment searching for a runaway, they observed psilocybin and cocaine. Appellant was convicted of two counts of possession of a controlled substance. On appeal, the court held that consent was not voluntary if it was nothing more than acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority. The court held that an officer's subjective testimony that appellant looked like he did not mind the intrusion and the fact that appellant had not invited the officers into his apartment showed that the consent was not voluntary. The court found no exigent circumstances excusing the warrantless intrusion into appellant's apartment because state failed to show that there was not time to obtain a search warrant or that the runaway was in danger of losing his life or suffering serious bodily injury. The court held that the plain view doctrine was inapplicable because the officers did not have a right to be in appellant's apartment when they saw the psilocybin. The court held that the cocaine obtained after officers obtained written consent was an exploitation of an illegal arrest and detention, and it was not purged of the primary taint of the illegal intrusion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded appellant's convictions for possession of a controlled substance because the trial court improperly denied appellant's motion to suppress evidence found in his apartment. State failed to show that appellant freely and voluntarily gave the police officers consent to enter and search his apartment, and there were no exigent circumstances that would otherwise justify the warrantless entry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bail bond company executed a surety bond to secure the release of a principle from custody. The principle failed to appear at a court hearing as required by the terms of the bail bond and was re-arrested. The principle entered a plea of guilty to the offense charged, was sentenced, and released from custody. The trial court rendered judgment against appellant in favor of the state for forfeiture of the bail bond. The court affirmed the judgment that granted a final forfeiture on the bail bond because under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 22.13(1989) disposition of the underlying criminal case did not exonerate appellant from liability on a bail bond where the principle failed to appear at a scheduled criminal hearing prior to the disposition of the criminal case. The court held that the only grounds for exonerating appellant from forfeiture of the bond were provided under art. 22.13. The bond was valid, the principle had not died, the principle was not sick or subjected to any other uncontrollable circumstances which prevented his appearance at court, and the state did not fail to present an indictment or information at the first term of the court after bail was posted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sued appellee doctor for medical malpractice. Appellant asserted that appellee's failure to advise her that he had not ligated her right fallopian tube led to the subsequent pregnancy and health problems.

The lower court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee. Appellant challenged, attacking the judgment and claiming that the lower court erred in granting summary judgment because the cause of action was not barred by the statute of limitations. Appellant asserted that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01, as applied to her cause of action, violated the open courts provision of the state constitution. The court disagreed. Appellant learned of her injury while there was a reasonable time to sue within the period prescribed by the statute, and thus the statute of limitations was not unconstitutional as applied to her. Further, the court ruled that there was not a disputed fact issue as to when appellant discovered the nature and full extent of her injuries.</SPAN></P>

Appellants contended that the court erred when it held that their malpractice claim was barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, patient and wife, contended that appellee doctor negligently performed a circumcision operation. A year after the surgery, appellant returned to appellee for treatment of redness and pain. Appellee's insurance carrier paid for corrective surgery arranged by appellee. Action was initiated by appellants within two years after the corrective surgery, but almost three years after the initial surgery. The trial court granted a take-nothing summary judgment on behalf of appellee, holding that appellants' claim was barred by the statute of limitations, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 4.01. On appeal, the court held that the limitations period began to run on the date of the initial surgery. Appellants did not allege that appellee negligently administered a course of treatment over a continuing period of time or that appellee misdiagnosed a condition. The corrective surgery did not extend the limitations period, but was merely an amicable attempt to settle a potential claim. The open courts provision, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, did not apply because it was not impossible for appellants to know of the injury within two years. The order was therefore affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for murder, contending the trial court reversibly erred by failing to read him the indictment at arraignment or trial, by excusing a potential juror sua sponte, and by including language on parole eligibility in the jury instructions. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding the trial court complied with the provisions of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 27.13 (1989), which pertained to procedures in guilty pleas. The court determined that defendant waived, in open court, the reading of the indictment, and that he was entitled to waive that right under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.14(a) (Supp. 1995). The court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's sua sponte dismissal of a potential juror based upon the determination that she could not deliberate in the case with clarity. The court concluded that following an amendment, Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect; 11(a) permitted the legislature to reenact Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07(4) to permit the trial court to inform the jury about the effect of good conduct time and eligibility for parole.</SPAN></P>

Relator argued that the order was void because he was incarcerated for failure to pay a debt in violation of Texas Const. art. I, &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator's wife filed suit for divorce and requested additional temporary orders seeking interim attorney fees and expenses. The trial court entered a temporary order requiring relator husband to make 10 payments of $ 5,000 for temporary spousal support. After relator failed to pay the $ 50,000 to the registry of the court, his wife filed a motion for contempt. The trial court found relator in contempt of court for failing to make the required payments and committed him to the county jail until he complied with the order. Thereafter, relator filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Relator argued that the contempt order was void because he was incarcerated for failure to pay a debt in violation of Texas Const. art. I, &sect; 18. The appeals court denied relator's petition. The court held that relator's confinement was valid pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 3.58(f) because he violated the temporary order. The court reasoned that obligations incurred for the support of children and spouses did not constitute a debt. Thus, an order of contempt arising from the failure to pay those obligations could be enforced by incarceration without running afoul of the constitutional prohibition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appellee judgment creditor's suit against appellant judgment debtor to collect on a default judgment, the trial court entered a turnover order requiring appellant to turn over monthly sums he received as an independent contractor. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding the trial court did not abuse its discretion. The court held that the trial court's findings of the monthly amount to be paid, and that appellant was working as an independent contractor, were supported by ample evidence, and thus were not arbitrary or unreasonable. Wages he received from his client were not exempt from turnover as &quot;current wages&quot; under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 31.002(f) (1995) or Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 42.001(b)(1) (1995) as appellant was an independent contractor.

Appellant claimed appellee doctor negligently recommended and negligently performed unnecessary hip replacement surgery, without his informed consent; and appellee manufacturer's cement product was defective causing the artificial hip to become loose. The court affirmed the take nothing judgment finding that the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act's, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, 6.02 (1995), procedure for obtaining a patient's informed consent through disclosure of risks promulgated by the Texas Medical Disclosure Panel was constitutional. The court reversed the summary judgment in favor of appellee manufacturer finding its summary judgment motion had not addressed causation, and had only argued that there was no defect in the cement. The court held the law did not provide for summary judgment for a defendant unless it conclusively negated an element of a plaintiff's cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction and sentence for burglary of a vehicle entered by the District Court of El Paso County (Texas).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to, was convicted of, and sentenced for burglary of a vehicle. On appeal, he asserted that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to compel sentencing under the amended version of the Texas Penal Code. Appellant committed his offense nearly one year before the effective date of the amendments. Consequently, the court found that the trial court properly applied the pre-revision version of the Penal Code at appellant's plea hearing and sentencing. Appellant also contended that Tex. Gov't Code Ann &sect; 311.031 provided for sentencing under an amended statute where the amendment reduced the punishment for an offense if punishment had not yet been imposed. However, the court determined that a general savings clause conflicted with the specific savings provision of the later enacted legislation that amended the Penal Code, and therefore, it was inapplicable. Appellant's equal protection claim was also without merit as appellant was tried and sentenced in the same manner as all criminal defendants who committed similar offenses prior to the effective date of the revised Penal Code. The judgment and sentence of the trial court was therefore affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellant further challenged his conviction, asserting that the municipal ordinance was void for vagueness, and the court on appeal agreed. The court found that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to appellant because &quot;willful&quot; was not defined, and because the police would not have sufficient information to prevent arbitrary enforcement of the ordinance. The court also found the second provision of the ordinance, prohibiting unnecessary noise, to be vague and to give insufficient notice to both appellant and the police.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On request by appellee corporation for judicial review of the application by appellants, an appraisal district and its appraisal review board, of an ad valorem property tax to appellee's shipping containers that were used only in foreign commerce, the trial court determined that the tax was unconstitutional as applied. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment on the initial appeal, but was reversed and directed by the United States Supreme Court to further consider the issue. On remand, the court noted that the parties had stipulated that the shipping containers had a sufficient nexus with the state, that the tax was fairly apportioned, and that it did not prevent the federal government from speaking with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments. The court further held that the tax did not discriminate against interstate commerce and that it was fairly related to the services provided by the state. Holding that there was a substantial risk that the containers would be subject to multiple taxation and that the tax thus violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I. &sect; 8, cl. 3, however, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state and local taxing units, brought actions against appellee landowner for agricultural roll-back taxes and penalties. At the time the agricultural roll-back tax was assessed, the only communication the statutes required to be given appellee was a statement for additional taxes, which did not reach appellee because they were sent to the prior owners of appellee's land. The statutes contained no provision for protesting the agricultural roll-back tax. Appellants challenged the judgment granting partial summary judgment in favor of appellee in appellants' actions for back taxes, penalties, and costs, and awarding appellee attorney's fees and costs under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The court affirmed and found the summary judgment was supported by sufficient evidence. The then-existing procedures violated appellee's due process rights because they were not adequate to provide appellee with either notice of the tax assessment or a meaningful opportunity to protest and have his protest heard. Appellee was entitled to attorney's fees and costs under &sect; 1988 because he obtained significant relief under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and thus was a prevailing party for purposes of &sect; 1988.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff concert patron appealed a judgment of 44th Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas), which was entered on a directed verdict as to all causes of action against defendants, city, police department and police officer, and as to all causes of action against defendants, theater operator and its affiliates, except assault, false imprisonment, and negligence, as to which judgment was entered against plaintiff on a take-nothing verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant theater operator's employee detained plaintiff concert patron after a scuffle and chase that was prompted by plaintiff's attempt to sell T-shirts at the concert. Plaintiff was ultimately arrested by defendant police officer, who was working as a security guard. Plaintiff sued defendants, city, police department, officer, theater operator, and affiliates. Defendants prevailed. On appeal, the court held that the evidence established that defendant officer was entitled to immunity because he acted in good faith under both state and federal law, and the trial court did not err in granting a directed verdict for defendants city, police department, and officer, on all causes of action. The court also affirmed the directed verdict for defendant theater operator and affiliates because there was no evidence of breach of contract, and affirmed the jury take-nothing verdict on other causes of action. The jury findings were legally and factually sufficient, the reconsideration of discovery sanctions was not an abuse of discretion, and any errors involved in the exclusion of deposition evidence and of testimony on attorney's fees, or in the trial judge's conduct, were harmless.</SPAN></P>

There was no evidence that defendants, theater operator and affiliates, breached a contract, and defendants, city, police department, and police officer, had immunity. The verdict on plaintiff concert patron's false imprisonment claims against defendant theater operator and affiliates was not against the weight of the evidence, and reconsideration of sanctions was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellant's notice of appeal met the requirements of Tex. R. App. P. 40(b)(1), and preserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to quash. Appellant failed to show the rule was unconstitutional as applied to him. However, the court found that appellant waived his right to appeal the alleged defects in the indictments because he did not object to the indictments before the date of trial, but filed his motion to quash on the day of trial. Further, appellant signed a form that expressly waived his right to challenge defects in the indictment. The court rejected appellant's argument that he was denied effective assistance of appellate counsel because, although the notice of appeal was proper, appellant presented nothing for review. The court therefore affirmed appellant's convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's orders convicting appellant of robbery were affirmed because appellant expressly waived his right to challenge any defects in the indictments, and waived his right to challenge the defects by failing to object to the indictments before the date of trial. Appellant's ineffective assistance of appellate counsel arguments were moot, as there were no valid issues raised for review on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction of misdemeanor assault in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.01(a) (1989), entered by the County Criminal Court at Law No. 10, Harris County, Texas. Appellant argued that the trial court improperly excused a juror sua sponte after the jury had been selected, sworn, and impaneled, and that his conviction was invalid because he did not execute a written waiver of his right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was tried for misdemeanor assault. During voir dire, a prospective juror indicated that he would be unable to concentrate on the trial. Nevertheless, he was seated as a juror and he failed to report to the trial court on the second day of trial. Over defense counsel's objection, he was excused from further jury service. The trial court then gave the defense the choice between proceeding to trial with five jurors or empanelling a new jury. Without waiving his objection, defense counsel chose to proceed with five jurors. The trial court convicted appellant of assault. On appeal the court reversed the conviction and held that a jury of five in county court was not a jury pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 33.01 and Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 62.301. The court further found that in the absence of a written waiver, appellant's mere participation in a trial without a full jury did not constitute a valid waiver of his right to trial by jury. The court remanded for a new trial and held that a new trial would not be an infringement of appellant's right against double jeopardy because appellant was still in the initial jeopardy proceeding in which an error had been found.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant's conviction and sentence for misdemeanor assault because a jury of fewer than six jurors in county court was not a jury trial, and appellant had never signed a waiver of his right to a jury trial. The court also remanded for a new trial and held that the double jeopardy clause did not preclude the state from retrying appellant's case because the conviction was set aside for an error in the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle by the 228th District Court, Harris County (Texas), claiming that his sentence of 50 years in prison subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of U.S. Const. amend VIII, Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 13, and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.09 (1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, and after ascertaining that he had previously been convicted of two prior felonies, was sentenced to 50 years in prison. He appealed his conviction and sentence, claiming that the sentence subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII, Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 13, and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.09 (1977). He claimed that the revision was unconstitutional. The prosecution argued that defendant waived his right to appeal because he never preserved the issues for appeal. The court in affirming the conviction and sentence decided to consider the issues anyway. It held that defendant was neither subjected to cruel and unusual punishment under the constitutions nor under the court rules. It reasoned that under the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code &sect; 12.42(d), a defendant who had two prior enumerated felonies and who was then convicted of a state jail felony should have been punished in accordance with the habitual offender statute, and would then be subjected to the same punishment as defendant received.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's sentence of 50 years in prison for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle because defendant's sentence was not cruel and unusual punishment and defendant, who met the requirements for sentencing under the habitual offender statute, would have been subjected to the same punishment range had the trial court sentenced him under the habitual offender statute.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and held that Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 did not provide greater protection than U.S. Const. Amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant chief of police challenged summary judgment granted for appellee police officer in appellee's action seeking to force appellant to appoint him to fill a vacancy on the force pursuant to Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 143.036(e) (1988) and &sect; 143.036(f) (Supp. 1995), following the felony conviction of a police sergeant. Appellee contended that a vacancy occurred when the police sergeant's conviction for a felony was entered. Appellant claimed that the vacancy did not occur until an agreed order was entered dismissing the sergeant's appeal of his removal from the police force. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling that pursuant to Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 415.058(a) (1988), the sergeant's felony conviction created an automatic vacancy because a convicted felon was disqualified from being an officer. Since an eligibility list existed on the date, and since appellee's name was on it, and given that appellant admitted that he would have promoted appellee had a vacancy existed at that time, the court held that appellant should have done so. Summary judgment for appellee was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insured was issued a series of occurrence liability policies that covered claims asserted after the policy periods expired, as long as appellant's acts or omissions gave rise to an occurrence during the covered policy periods. The insurer was designated an &quot;impaired insurer&quot; subject to the Texas Property and Casualty Guaranty Act (Guaranty Act), Tex. Ins.

A number of former patients sued appellant in 1991 and 1992 alleging injuries whose occurrence dates fell within coverage. Appellee rejected this proof of claim as being filed after the filing deadline. The trial court affirmed appellee's determination. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, concluding that article 21.28 did not authorize extension of the filing deadline for equitable reasons, it only provided for the filing of know claims, and that appellee was required to apply the same filing deadline to all claims presented to it to assure some degree of finality in the liquidation proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The police chief refused appellee's promotion due to his relationship with a fellow police officer's wife, who was also employed by the police department, on the grounds that appellee would not command respect and trust from other members of the department, and that appellee's promotion would adversely affect the efficiency and morale of the department. The trial court held that as a matter of law appellant had violated appellee's constitutional rights. Reviewing the constitutional question de novo, the court noted that appellee's conduct was legal, that there were no allegations that appellee ever engaged in sexual activity while on duty, that all the witnesses with personal knowledge of the police department testified that the department's morale and discipline had not suffered in the three months after the relationship became common knowledge, and that there were no written regulations or guidelines prohibiting the complained-of conduct that were carefully tailored to meet appellee's specified needs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment as it related to the constitutional issues was affirmed, as appellee public employee's conduct was protected by the Texas Constitution, and appellant city did not prove it had a compelling governmental interest that could be achieved by no less intrusive, more reasonable means. The trial court's judgment as related to attorney's fees was reversed and remanded as appellant's affidavits raised issues of material fact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient challenged the judgment of the 113th District Court of Harris County (Texas), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee doctor in appellant's suit for medical malpractice. The trial court dismissed the claim on the basis that the two-year statute of limitations provided by the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i (1995), had expired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient brought suit against appellee doctor for medical malpractice. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee. The court affirmed the judgment and held that appellant's claim was barred by the statute of limitations. The court also held that because appellant's claims were health care liability claims, they were governed by the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i (1995). The court stated that the subject of appellant's claim was appellee's failure to diagnose and treat her, and no course of treatment was established by appellee. The court held that the continuing course of treatment theory did not apply to appellant's claim. The court also held that appellant served a notice of claim on appellee more than two years after her last visit with appellee. The court further held that appellant failed to establish that a fact issue existed as to whether they knew or should have known of appellee's negligence within two years of its occurrence; therefore, the open courts defense did not apply to negate the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction by jury verdict in the 210th District Court of El Paso County (Texas) for the offense of murder and the assessment of life imprisonment. Appellant contended that jury instructions were erroneous, and that the trial court erred in not having found appellant insane.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction, by jury, for the offense of murder and the punishment of life imprisonment. The court affirmed. The inclusion of a parole law instruction to the jury at the punishment stage was not error because the trial judge admonished the jury not to consider the parole laws as applied to appellant. The trial judge's instruction regarding a deadlock was supported by extensive authority and was not coercive. The court upheld the jury's rejection of appellant's insanity defense because the issue of insanity was within the province of the jury. While appellant presented extensive medical evidence concerning his schizophrenia, the state presented medical evidence contradicting that testimony. Appellant's objections to testimony by the state regarding his post-arrest silence, which he previously allowed into evidence, was without merit on appeal. Appellant was not denied a speedy trial because the delay was due to appellant's own agreement that he was incompetent to stand trial until a date when he agreed to an order of competency. The trial court did not err in admitting a medical opinion that was based on information provided by appellant's sisters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction for murder and punishment of life imprisonment. The trial judge did not err in instructing the jury on a parole law because a curative instruction was issued. The issue of insanity was within the province of the jury, and testimony pertaining to appellant's post-arrest silence was already introduced by appellant. The delay in trial was due to appellant's lack of competency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order the 220th District Court, Bosque County (Texas), which convicted appellant of involuntary manslaughter after allowing the state to introduce appellant's videotape conversation with an officer, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.22, &sect; 5 (1995), and charging the jury on the two types of driving while intoxicated offenses under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 49.01 (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was driving an automobile and was involved in a collision in which a young boy riding a bicycle was killed.

Part of the recorded conversation and the results of the test were offered into evidence by the state. Appellant was convicted by a jury of involuntary manslaughter and because she was intoxicated while driving, using a deadly weapon. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court in finding that the recorded statement by appellant was voluntary and not the result of custodial interrogation and it was therefore admissible pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.22, &sect; 5 (1995). The court further held that the trial court did not err in charging the jury on the two types of driving while intoxicated offenses under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 49.01 (1994), and that an automobile could be considered a deadly weapon in an involuntary manslaughter conviction arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city asserted that appellee police officer's appeal of his suspension was untimely and improper. The trial court granted appellee's summary judgment motion seeking mandamus relief, and appellant sought review. The court reversed a portion of the trial court's judgment granting mandamus relief to appellee and summary judgment to the state, but affirmed the judgment in all other respects. The court found that appellee's notice of appeal was not untimely, as his interlocutory partial summary judgment merged into the final judgment; thus, appellee's partial summary judgment was proper. However, in the absence of an affidavit or a properly authenticated exhibit, appellee was not entitled to summary judgment. The court held that the trial court improperly granted the state's summary judgment declaring Tex. Local Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 143.057(d) (1988) unconstitutional, as there was no constitutional challenge at the time that the state's summary judgment was heard. Appellant waived error in the trial court's denial of its amended summary judgment motion, and in the denial of its motion to strike the state's intervention, as it did not cite authorities to support its point.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, children of decedent, filed suit against appellee health care providers. They alleged medical malpractice resulting in the wrongful death of decedent. Appellees moved for summary judgment, alleging that the statute of limitations under the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4950i, &sect; 10.01, barred the action. Summary judgment was granted. Appellants challenged on the grounds that the Act violated the due process clause, Tex.

The two-year limitations period did not violate due process because it was reasonable in relation to the stated purposes of the Act. Further, the court held the limitations period, as applied to minors, did not violate equal protection, but only in order to be consistent with controlling precedent. The court noted that section 10.01 had been ruled unconstitutional as to minors bringing suit for their own personal injuries and stated its agreement with another appellate court that minors who had lost a parent due to the same type of negligence should be equally deserving of protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed summary judgment in favor of appellee health care providers in a medical malpractice suit, holding that the statute of limitations period for bringing medical malpractice claims did not violate the due process clause of the state constitution because it was reasonable. Furthermore, the statute of limitation did not violate the equal protection clause of the state constitution because controlling precedent required such holding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate brought suit and contended that the Texas Department of Criminal Justice's (TDCJ) grooming standards were unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed with prejudice appellant's suit against appellee executive director of the TDCJ because it was frivolous under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 13.001. Appellant contended that the policy violated his equal protection rights and that the grooming policy caused him to lose his individuality and self-esteem because he was not able to grow his hair in a way that flattered him to compensate for hereditary hair loss. The court concluded that the grooming regulation which forbid long hair and challenged by appellant was reasonably related to the legitimate penological interests of security, allocation of resources, and health and safety, and was therefore valid. The court held that the cause of action was frivolous because the claim had no arguable basis in law and the dismissal was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for burglary of a building, and his sentence of 25-years confinement. He contended that the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss the venire after a prospective juror stated that she knew appellant had prior convictions, that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for burglary because the state did not prove intent, and that the instruction to the jury on parole and the effect of good conduct under Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (1995) was unconstitutional under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 13 and 19. The court found that appellant was not forced to accept a juror who was prejudicially influenced by any comments, and he failed to show harm arising from the juror's remark. A rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant entered the house with the intent to commit theft. Because Tex. Const. art. IV was amended to permit the legislature to enact laws that required or permitted courts to inform juries about the effect of good conduct time and eligibility for parole, the reenactment of article 37.07 was constitutional. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimed the trial court erred by denying his motions to dismiss the informations because both alleged that he discharged industrial waste into and adjacent to water in the state, and a sanitary sewer line was not within the statutory definition of &quot;water in the state.&quot; He also claimed that &sect;&sect; 26.2121(a), 26.2121(d), and 26.121(a)(1) were unconstitutionally vague because he was not able to know in advance from the written statute that his act was criminal.

There was no evidence that appellant was confused about the meaning of any statute or unable to comply with it. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county challenged a decision of the 125th District Court, Harris County, Texas, which ruled for appellee property owners in a de novo hearing on an ad valorem property tax valuation despite the fact that appellees had not paid the taxes due before they became delinquent as required under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 42.08(b) (1992).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee property owners filed a protest against the ad valorem property tax valuation of their property by appellant county. Appellant lowered the appraisal value, but the valuation was not low enough. Appellees filed for de novo review in the trial court. Appellant filed for summary judgment and alleged that the trial court no longer had subject matter jurisdiction under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 42.08(b) (1992) because appellees had not paid any portion of the taxes before they became delinquent. The trial court denied the motion, the case was tried, and the trial court ruled for appellee. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and rendered judgment dismissing the case on appeal. The court held that because appellees had paid no portion of the taxes by the due date, the appeal should have been dismissed for want of subject matter jurisdiction. The court further held that appellees' argument that &sect; 42.08(b) was unconstitutional under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, was waived because the issue was not raised at trial and the failure to object was not excused by the novelty or the futility of the claim.</SPAN></P>

The Act required an unlicensed dispensing optician or ophthalmic dispenser to obtain a complete physical copy of the patient's prescription before dispensing lenses.

After viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, the court found sufficient evidence existed to connect appellant to the murder and to support the jury's verdict. Additionally, the court found that evidence regarding appellant's membership in a street gang constituted very probative evidence because it showed the witness's potential bias or motive in refusing to testify against appellant and in claiming that neither he nor appellant participated in the robbery and murder in spite of his previous testimony and guilty plea at his own trial. Furthermore, the prejudicial effect of the evidence was limited by the two instructions from the trial court to the jury to consider the evidence only for impeachment purposes. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction by the 347th District Court of Nueces County (Texas) for third degree felony theft under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(a) for intentionally and knowingly appropriating liquor, valued between $ 750 and $ 20,000, from the liquor store without the owner's consent and with the intent to deprive the owner of the liquor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that convicted appellant of third degree felony theft under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(a) for intentionally and knowingly appropriating liquor, valued between $ 750 and $ 20,000, from a liquor store without the owner's consent and with the intent to deprive the owner of the liquor. As appellant was &quot;unavailable,&quot; the court held that his unwarned, unrecorded, voluntary oral statements made to a Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission agent with regard to cases of liquor found in the bed of his truck were admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule, Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 806, and were properly admitted for impeachment of his credibility as a witness, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.22(5). The court held the liquor was properly confiscated without a warrant, Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. art. 103.03(1), as appellant did not have the requisite transportation statement and failed to invoke the personal consumption exception, Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 107.08. Finally, appellant failed to meet his burden that the identity of a confidential informant should have been disclosed, Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 508(c).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Lawyer represented plaintiffs in the civil suit underlying the mandamus action. He was accused of stealing relator corporations' investigation file. Relators sought sanctions, and a hearing was held where lawyer appeared with counsel. When he was asked what he possessed and how he obtained it, he refused to answer, claiming that to do so would expose him to criminal liability. The court held that opposing counsel and the trial court sought and were entitled to an accounting of lawyer's use of the public trust bestowed on him. This trust obligated him to respond to the accusations leveled against him, and the trial court should have imposed some meaningful penalty on him for his refusal to do so. On these facts, mandamus will lie to correct the trial court's misapplication of the law to the facts. The court conditionally granted the writ of mandamus and ordered respondent to rescind his order to the extent that it did not disqualify law firm from representing plaintiffs in the underlying suit and did not sanction lawyer. The court further ordered that respondent issue an order disqualifying law firm from representing plaintiffs in the underlying suit and sanctioning lawyer.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, holding that in the absence of a plea bargain agreement, a voluntary plea of guilty waived all nonjurisdictional defects. The controlled substance tax statute was not facially defective and various arguments of appellant were not jurisdictional for purposes of the Helms rule.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed a summary judgment granted in favor of defendant architects. Plaintiff contended that the statute of repose was unconstitutional. Plaintiff additionally asserted that the Deceptive Trade Practices Act claims were not barred by the statute of repose. Plaintiff claimed that fact issues existed on whether defendant fraudulently concealed defects in the design of a waste water measuring system, committed constructive fraud in connection with the system, or was negligent in designing the system. The reviewing court affirmed summary judgment for defendant. Plaintiff did not raise the constitutionality of the statute of repose in its response to defendant's motion for partial summary judgment and waived raising the issue on appeal. The court found that the discovery rule did not apply to the statute of repose. Thus, to avoid being barred by the statute, plaintiff was required to file any claims it had against defendant for the 1977 design no later than September 1988. Because plaintiff failed to institute the suit within 10 years of completion of the 1977 system, the trial judge properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction and the court affirmed. The court held that sufficient evidence existed to convict defendant of murder either as the principal or as a party to the murder.

The indictment included four separate paragraphs. The lower court granted appellee's motion to quash the indictment, and the prosecution sought review. The prosecution alleged that it was improper to find the indictment defective. The question before the court was whether the face of the indictment set forth in plain and intelligible language sufficient information to enable appellee to prepare his defense. The court found that paragraphs one and three of the indictment failed to adequately notify appellee of the charges he must defend against and they did not sufficiently enable him to plead any resulting judgment to bar further prosecution for the same offense. Paragraph two of the indictment was defective because it failed to allege what purported mistreatment was unlawful or that appellee knew the purported mistreatment was unlawful. The fourth paragraph was defective because it failed to give appellee notice of the manner and means of his alleged criminal acts and failed to define several key terms. Thus, the court affirmed the order dismissing the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for intentionally and knowingly causing bodily harm to a child younger than 14 under Tex. Penal Code &sect; 22.04(a), based on the contention his confession was inadmissible due to lack of voluntariness. The court reversed appellant's conviction concluding that error existed in both the admission of extraneous offense evidence and in the admission of a confession extracted through police psychological and physical coercion. The court explained that appellee state's witnesses established that the confession was the product of a custodial interrogation where appellant was yelled at, shoved against a wall, and lifted off the ground. The court determined a sufficient break did not exist between the undisputed coercion and the confession. The court explained that it was unable to conclude that the admission of the confession was harmless when it was emphasized by appellee in support of witness corroboration by an admitted liar. The court reasoned it could not conclude the confession did not contribute to the conviction under such circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney sought review of the judgment from the 37th District Court of Bexar County (Texas) that granted partial summary judgment in favor of appellee state bar in a disciplinary action under the Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof'l. Conduct 7.01(a)(1) and denied appellant's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney challenged the trial court judgment that granted appellee state bar's motion for summary judgment and assessed a public reprimand and costs against appellant for a violation of Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof'l. Conduct 7.01(a)(1). The action was instituted as the result of appellant's solicitation of clients through a letter that stated that the client would incur no &quot;fees&quot; if the suit were unsuccessful. The court affirmed summary judgment, concluding that there was no genuine issue of material fact in dispute with regard to the language regarding his fee. The court held that the letters contained false, misleading and deceptive statements where appellant failed to distinguish between legal fees and costs and to state the amount of his fee as required by Rule 7.01(a)(1), and were misleading to laymen who were unaware of the technical meanings of such terms as fees and costs. The court found that the disclosure requirements of Rule 7.01(a)(1) were reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception of consumers and were not violative of appellant's right to commercial free speech or his due process rights guaranteed by the U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment that granted summary judgment in favor of appellee state bar, holding that appellant violated disciplinary disclosure rules by sending a client solicitation letter that was inherently deceptive where it represented that no fees would be incurred in an unsuccessful case without mentioning legal costs, how they were distinct from fees, or stating the amount of his fee.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the punishment was disproportionate to the crime, and that the lack of sentencing guidelines deprived him of equal protection and due process. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that appellant waived these arguments because he did not raise them in the trial court. The court noted, however, that the trial court assessed punishment within the range set by Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.106 (1994). Because appellant was given numerous chances to change his ways and all attempts at drug rehabilitation had failed, the court held that the sentence was not arbitrary or capricious. Further, the court stated that the sentencing system ensured against arbitrary or capricious assessment of punishment because it allowed appellant to elect whether the trial court or a jury would determine his sentence. Thus, the court held that the sentencing scheme did not violate the U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV or Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was convicted of retaliation under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 36.06(a) (1989). On review sought by appellant, the court affirmed his conviction. The court held that appellant intended to threaten the witness with the letter because appellant used the witness's first name, implied knowledge about the witness's children, and stated that prison hardened the heart. The court found that the indictment was not void for its referral to a prior offense for enhancement purposes because in order for the prior conviction to be used against appellant in connection with the primary offense, the prior conviction had to be alleged in the indictment. The court also ruled that appellant failed to establish an insanity defense by a preponderance of the evidence where a psychologist testified that appellant knew the difference between right and wrong at the time the offense was committed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the denial of habeas corpus and held that there was a presumption that the statute was valid and a party challenging the constitutionality of a statute had the burden of proof to establish its invalidity. The court held that the indictment alleged an offense as defined by Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.25(b) and the lower court did not err in denying the motion to quash. The court held that appellant had not demonstrated that in its operation, the statute was unconstitutional and had not brought forward the statement of facts from the habeas corpus hearing as required under Tex. R. App. P. 50(d). The court found that Tex. Penal Code Ann &sect; 43.25 was not impermissibly vague and when measured by its common understanding and practices, the statute fairly apprised appellant of the conduct it proscribed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother sought review of summary judgments entered in favor of defendants, doctors and hospital, by the 166th District Court of Bexar County (Texas) because plaintiff's wrongful death actions were barred by the statute of limitations pursuant to the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act (MLIIA), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (1995).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother, individually and as administratrix, sued defendants, doctors and hospital, alleging that their negligence caused the wrongful death of her newborn son (decedent). The trial court granted summary judgment on each claim based on the statute of limitations in the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act (MLIIA), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4095i, &sect; 10.01 (1995). On appeal, plaintiff argued that &sect; 10.01 did not apply, or that if it did, defendants fraudulently concealed the causes of action. Further, plaintiff argued that the statute of limitations were tolled because of the minority of the decedent. The court found that plaintiff's case was founded on a health care liability claim, therefore, the operative limitation period for redress was the one specified by &sect; 10.01 of MLIIA. However, the court also found that the statute of limitation was tolled from the date of the alleged injuries until the date of the minor's death. Therefore, plaintiff was not time-barred from filing the wrongful death claims with regard to her derivative action. Accordingly, the judgments were reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary judgments entered in favor of defendants, doctors and hospital, in plaintiff mother's wrongful death actions, were reversed and remanded for trial because the summary judgment evidence failed to show that defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law based upon the affirmative defense of limitations.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because appellant's calls were collect and appellant made disclosures of the information to other inmates, appellant had neither a subjective nor objective expectation of privacy in the existence of his calls and he lacked standing to contest the acquisition or use of the billing records used in support of the affidavit for the wiretap order.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, they challenged dismissal of the suit, denial of their requests to amend their petition, and the constitutionality of Tex. Lab. Code Ann. art. 5221b. The court affirmed the denial of benefits because the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case, and appellants failed to preserve constitutional challenges for review. Appellants dropped their employers as defendants in their second amended pleadings, which superseded the originals. Since the employers were not added within the statutory time limit, the court lacked jurisdiction to grant leave to amend and had to dismiss the suit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commission challenged an order of the 53rd Judicial District Court, Travis County (Texas) that granted an injunction sought by appellee distributors. A cross-appeal disputed the trial court's denial of the injunction. The issues were whether the granted injunction was valid, whether the trial court erred in dissolving that injunction, and whether the trial court should have granted a second request for that injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee distributors sought to enjoin appellant commission from enforcing Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 102.52, as amended by 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 3950, 3975. The trial court granted a temporary injunction, which appellant challenged. On rehearing, the trial court dissolved the injunction, which appellees challenged. Appellees then sought a second temporary injunction, which the trial court denied, which denial appellees challenged. On appeal, the court dismissed appellant's challenge. Because the injunction had been dissolved, the appeal was moot, and the court had no jurisdiction to consider it. The court could not review appellees' challenge to the dissolution of the injunction, because they had not timely perfected the appeal. The court affirmed the denial of the second request for the injunction, because appellees asserted no new grounds and circumstances had not changed since the dissolution of the injunction. Further, the trial court had not clearly abused its discretion in denying the second request for the injunction. Even if it were an initial request, appellees had not demonstrated a probable right to recover at trial on the merits and probable injury in the interim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed appellant commission's challenge, holding that, once the injunction was dissolved, the court had no jurisdiction over it. The court did not consider the cross-appeal as to dissolution of the injunction because it had not been timely brought. The court affirmed as to denial of the second request, holding that the trial court had not clearly abused its discretion, and no new grounds were asserted nor had circumstances changed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged decisions of the 185th District Court of Harris County (Texas) that denied the relief requested in their pretrial petitions for writs of habeas corpus. At issue was whether the amendment of certain gambling statutes, subsequent to the alleged offense, so as to carry a lighter penalty rendered unconstitutional, as cruel and unusual punishment, the application to appellants of the former statutes carrying a heavier penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were charged with engaging in organized criminal activity consisting of gambling offenses. As an element of the offense, appellants were also charged with the commission of other, predicate offenses. The legislature amended the statutes proscribing the predicate offenses, effective September 1, 1994, downgrading their punishment category from third degree felony to Class A misdemeanor. Appellants and the state agreed that appellants were charged with committing their offenses before September 1, 1994. Appellant filed petitions for writ of habeas corpus challenging the application of the former statutes carrying a heavier penalty. The trial court denied the petitions. The court affirmed, finding that the rule that habeas corpus relief should not be granted when there was an adequate remedy at law should be adhered to when there was good reason to support it. The court held that the good reason in this case was to avoid wasting judicial resources to decide a matter that would not stop the prosecution and might become moot. The court found that if appellants were not convicted, the question of the constitutionality of the old statutory penalties would become moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's orders denying the relief requested in appellants' petitions for writs of habeas corpus were affirmed on the basis that, even if appellants' points of error were sustained, that would not have stopped the prosecution of their cases. The court followed the general rule that a court should not grant habeas corpus relief when there was an adequate remedy by appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Criminal District Court No. 4 of Tarrant County (Texas), which convicted him of capital murder and imposed a mandatory life sentence after the state waived the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted appellant of capital murder. The court affirmed that judgment on appeal. The court found that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.31(a) (1994) did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII or Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 13, 19 by imposing an automatic life sentence if the state waived the death penalty in a capital murder case. The court reasoned that having a jury hear the sentencing phase when the death penalty was sought met the requirement of having the jury determine whether any mitigating circumstances warranted a life sentence. The court also held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071, &sect; 1 (1995) was not unconstitutional for failure to avoid arbitrary and capricious infliction of punishment because the law, not the jury or the judge, predetermined the punishment if the death penalty was waived. The court further found that a mandatory life sentence did not rise to the level of being cruel and unusual punishment. The court additionally ruled that the right to have a jury assess punishment was not constitutionally based.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support the judgment and contended that &sect; 15.024 violated equal protection by singling out the mentally ill and was unconstitutionally vague by not defining mental illness. On appeal, the court affirmed the termination of appellant's parental rights. The court balanced the needs of the children and the termination, finding that the evidence was factually sufficient to show that appellant was unable to meet the physical, emotional, and mental needs of the children; that in all reasonable probability appellant would not be able to care for the children until they reached 18; and that termination of appellant's parental rights was in the children's best interest. The court held that there was no equal protection violation because &sect; 15.024 was rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in protecting children; and that &sect; 15.024 was not void for vagueness when read in its plain and ordinary meaning.</SPAN></P>

The sentence was cumulated on a sentence defendant was serving in Virginia. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's 1986 conviction for delivery of a controlled substance, cocaine, was reversed for a punishment charge error in 1990. In 1993, the trial court refused to dismiss the cocaine indictment under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD), Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 51.14 (1979), and defendant was sentenced to 60 years in prison. The court affirmed the judgment and sentence. IAD did not apply because no detainer was issued for the cocaine offense and the offense for which a detainer was issued did not arise out of the same transaction. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 44.29(b) (1995) was not an ex post facto law. Art. 44.29(b) was a procedural statute, and procedural statutes applied to both pending and future actions from their effective date. U.S. Const. amend. XIV did not prohibit defendant's increased sentence based on the intervening Virginia conviction after his successful appeal because it was not the result of actual vindictiveness. Cumulation of his sentence with the Virginia sentence under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 4208 did not violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws because only the offense predated the 1987 amendments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant appraisal district challenged the judgment of the 22nd Judicial District Court, Hays County (Texas), which referred the dispute concerning the market value of appellee property owner's real property to arbitration pursuant to former section Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee property owner had property that was subdivided into residential lots sold as a trade or business.

The trial court entered judgment in favor of appellee as determined by the arbitrator. On appeal, the court held that by purporting to allow the taxpayer to invoke secret proceedings in the appraisal of property for ad valorem tax purposes, former &sect; 42.225 violated Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The court held that former &sect; 42.225 infringed unduly upon the judicial power in violation of the separation of powers principle, and it was an unconstitutional delegation of judicial power implicitly prohibited by Tex.

The court held that the former provision, which permitted a property owner who appealed an appraisal review board order to have the appeal resolved through binding arbitration, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2 prohibited the appraisal of land, for ad valorem purposes, on any basis other than market value. An amendment excluded from the prohibition qualified open-space lands devoted to agriculture and timber production and applied a new appraisal method. Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 23.51(1) (1978) defined qualified open-space lands to include land used as an ecological laboratory. Appellee landowner filed a suit against appellant board, which denied its application to classify its land as qualified open-space land. Appellant sought to declare &sect; 23.51(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional since its definition added a third class of land, land used as an ecological laboratory, entitled to the new appraisal method. The trial court adjudged the statute constitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and found the statute to be unconstitutional to the extent it purported to remove from market-value appraisal open-space land used as an ecological laboratory and held that the amendment specifically excluded from the prohibition agricultural and timber lands but did not authorize, by implication, the new appraisal method for land used as an ecological laboratory.</SPAN></P>

As of January 1, 1992, appellant was still in possession of the vehicles. Appellee municipal appraisal district determined that appellant was the owner of the vehicles for tax purposes and appraised the vehicles at $ 2.8 million. Appellant challenged the determination to the review board which upheld the appraisal. Appellant timely sought review to the trial court, contending that it was not the owner of the vehicles. The trial court granted appellee's motion to dismiss the appeal because appellant failed to pay the undisputed portion of the taxes per statute. The court affirmed, holding that a property owner who appealed an appraisal to the courts was required to pay the greater of the undisputed amount of taxes or the tax imposed in the preceding year. Failure to do such warranted dismissal of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The police proceeded to the ex-wife's home and, while there, defendant drove by, which was a violation of the protective order in itself as it forced defendant to come within 200 feet of his ex-wife's residence. When the police saw this, they followed defendant, arrested him, and during a search incident to that arrest discovered methamphetamine on defendant's person. Defendant was convicted of possession of methamphetamine and he appealed that conviction. The court affirmed, and held that defendant waived his challenge to the admission of the methamphetamine evidence by not objecting in the trial court even where defendant's challenge was based on his claim that the statute regarding violating a protective order, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 25.07(1994), was unconstitutionally vague and, therefore, the evidence was the product of an unlawful arrest. The court found that the officers had probable cause to arrest where three individuals, including the officers, testified that defendant was within 200 feet of his ex-wife's home.</SPAN></P>

This &quot;watching&quot; incident came after the police had been called to intervene previously and they were again called on this occasion. The police eventually obtained a warrant for defendant's arrest and arrested defendant. Defendant challenged his conviction on multiple grounds and, on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 42.07(a)(7) was not unconstitutionally vague or overly broad where it adequately defined the criminal conduct which it sought to prevent and provided very specific guidelines for its enforcement. As to defendant's claim that his sitting and watching the victim from his car was not conduct prohibited by the statute, the court disagreed and held that based on the specific facts, there was no question that this conduct was intended to abuse and torment the victim.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the motion. On appeal, the court first concluded that &sect; 5318(g)(3), which was enacted after appellant's claims accrued, could be applied retroactively because appellant did not have a vested right in his unadjudicated claims. However, the court concluded that &sect; 5318(g)(3) did not insulate bank officials from liability for knowingly making a false report of possible criminal activity and reversed the grant of summary judgment because there were genuine fact issues as to whether appellees knew that their accusation against appellant was false.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband and appellee wife signed a pre-marital agreement in Hawaii where they resided. They moved to Texas and appellee subsequently filed for divorce. The trial court found that the pre-marital agreement was not executed voluntarily and that it was unconscionable. The court reversed finding that there was not duress in procuring appellee's signature because the threat that appellee would not get married without her first signing the pre-marital agreement, and cancelling the wedding was a reasonable alternative for not signing the agreement if she did not agree with it. The court found that there was no undue influence evidence presented other than appellee was domineering. The court found under Hawaii law that the agreement was not so disproportionate that it could not enforce it. The court held that a balance sheet was not inadequate to provide financial disclosure and that appellee had adequate knowledge of appellee's financial situation.

Appellant conceded that his punishment was within the statutory range of punishment for a felony under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.42(d) (1994). On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the enhancement of punishment under &sect; 12.42(d), did not render the punishment unconstitutionally cruel and unusual. The court also found that the sentence was not disproportionate to the offense committed, and that the revised sentencing guidelines were not dispositive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction and 35-year prison term, because the enhancement of punishment for two prior felony convictions under the recidivist statute did not make the punishment cruel and unusual. The court also found that the sentence was not disproportionate to the offense committed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the 182nd District Court, Harris County (Texas), which convicted her of involuntary manslaughter after appellant entered a plea of no contest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter after pleading no contest without an agreed punishment recommendation from state. Appellant challenged the conviction, attacking the validity of her plea. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.15 (1994), was constitutional and did not prohibit appellant from presenting evidence or the trial court from considering such evidence. The court held that when a guilty plea was entered, a defendant must specifically waive the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, the right to trial by jury, and the right to confront one's accusers. The court held that because the record clearly showed that appellate waived these rights, the trial court could render its judgment after accepting her plea. The court held that a defendant was not required to expressly waive the right to compulsory due process before entering a plea. The court held that appellant's sentence was proportional to the offense committed based upon the gravity of the offense, the harm caused to the victim and society, appellant's culpability, and the harshness of the penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of cocaine possession and sentenced to an enhanced term of imprisonment because of prior convictions. Defendant appealed the trial court's denial of a motion to suppress evidence, denial of a motion to quash the indictment, denial of a motion to strike the enhancements, permitting evidence concerning prior convictions and arrests, and denial of a motion for a new trial. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the challenged evidence because questions concerning the care and custody of the evidence went to its weight rather than admissibility. The court also found that the trial court had not abused its discretion when it denied the motion to strike the enhancements but had, instead, properly applied Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.46. Finally, the court noted that defendant waived any objections to the evidence concerning his prior convictions and arrests and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought a medical malpractice action against defendant physicians and health care facility. The trial court granted defendants summary judgment because more than two years had elapsed between the negligent health care treatment and when she filed her claim. Defendants claimed that this violated the statute of limitations of the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (1995), which adopted an absolute two-year statute of limitations period. However, case law found the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act unconstitutional insofar as it prevented injured persons from bringing suit before they had a reasonable opportunity to discover the wrong. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to defendants because more than a year passed between when plaintiff discovered the negligence and when she brought suit, and, therefore, her delay was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant child filed his paternity action against appellee putative father when he was 57 years old. When summary judgment was granted to appellee, he sought review arguing that there was no reasonable statute of limitations applicable to his situation or that if there was one, it violated his equal protection rights. The court found that no specific provision in Family Code applied to appellant's right to bring paternity action. As such, it looked to the residual limitations period of four years contained in Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 16.051, and concluded that, even if it tolled that period until appellant learned the possible identity of his father, his action would still have been barred because it was filed six years after he discovered the possible identity of his father. Because appellant did not show any impermissible statutory classification that discriminated against him as an illegitimate child, or that he had been denied any substantial benefit accorded to children generally, the court found no equal protection violation. While the court was sympathetic to appellant's desire to learn the identity of his father, it affirmed the summary judgment for appellee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant probationer sought a temporary injunction to require appellee Board of Pardons and Paroles to hold appellant's parole revocation hearing after a determination of his competency. The court denied the temporary injunction, and appellant sought review. Appellant argued that he was entitled to an injunction because he was facing a constitutional injury. The court analogized appellant's argument to a pretrial order involving the constitutionality of a criminal statute, which was interlocutory and could not be appealed until a final judgment was rendered. The court found no reason to grant appellant a right denied criminal defendants and concluded that his only method of redress was to file a post-incarceration petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Because there was no evidence in the record that appellant's request for a injunction would affect the mandate of the Court of Criminal Appeals, it concluded that the trial court did have jurisdiction to consider the injunction sought by appellant. It held, however, that the court did not have the authority to grant appellant declaratory relief on the constitutionality of appellee's rules which may result in his reincarceration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged the judgment of the 332nd District Court, Hidalgo County (Texas), that awarded attorneys' fees to appellee civil rights organizations in conjunction with appellees' successful challenge of the Texas House of Representatives' and Senate's redistricting plans on the grounds that such plans illegally and unconstitutionally discriminated against Mexican-Americans.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee civil rights organizations successfully enjoined appellant state from using the 1991 legislative enactments redistricting the Texas House of Representatives and the Texas Senate, appellees sought reimbursement for their attorneys' fees from appellant. The court affirmed the trial court's determination that attorneys' fees were available to appellees, but reversed some of the awards made by the trial court. The court held that appellant's use of the unconstitutionally discriminatory redistricting plans were prohibited acts under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 106.001(a)(6). Further, the court held that appellant's immunity was waived pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 106.002(b). With respect to the evidentiary foundation for the award of attorneys' fees, the court held two attorneys were competent to testify as fact witnesses regarding their attorneys' fees. The court, however, held that the reasonableness of attorneys' fees had to be supported by competent evidence and that there was no evidentiary foundation that the attorneys' fees were reasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's determination that appellant state's 1991 enactments regarding redistricting imposed an unreasonable burden on Mexican-Americans due to their national origin and that the trial court could award attorneys' fees to appellee civil rights organizations. The court, however, reversed some of the attorneys' fees awarded to appellees because there was no evidentiary foundation that such fees were reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment and sentence for the crime of delivery of a controlled substance of less than 28 grams, entered by the 364th Judicial District Court of Lubbock County (Texas), based upon the trial court's denial of his motion to be sentenced under the amended version of Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.112(b) (1992).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant moved the trial court to be sentenced under the amended version of Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 482.112(b) (1992), which reclassified the crime of delivery of a controlled substance of less than 28 grams from a first degree felony to a state jail felony. The trial court denied the motion. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. In so ruling, the court rejected appellant's argument that the savings provisions clause of the Code Construction Act, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 311.031 (1988), mandated that his sentence be determined in accordance with the revised version of &sect; 481.112(b). The court held that &sect; 311.031 was not applicable because the senate bill which revised &sect; 481.112(b) specifically stated that it did not apply to offenses, such as appellant's, which were committed prior to the effective date of the amendments. The court also ruled that the trial court did not deny appellant his U.S. Const. amend. V right to equal protection by applying the old version of &sect; 481.112(b). The court held that appellant was treated no differently than any other criminal defendant who committed the charged offense before the effective date of the amendments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the order of the District Court of Travis County, 147th Judicial District (Texas) that found him guilty of two counts of aggravated robbery pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 29.03. He appealed on numerous grounds, including the unconstitutionality of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 37.07, &sect; 3(a), which permitted evidence regarding unadjudicated offenses to be admitted during punishment phase of his criminal trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of armed robbery. During the punishment phase of his trial, evidence of two prior unadjudicated armed robberies committed during the same week as the charged offenses were admitted pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 3(a). Appellant sought review, arguing that this section was unconstitutional because it was vague, denied him due process, delegated legislative power to the judiciary, and violated the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Appellant did not raise these challenges in the trial court, and, therefore, the court concluded that he did not preserve them for appeal as required by Tex. R. App. P. 52(a). The court found that even if appellant had preserved them for appeal, he failed to show, or even to assert, that the section was unconstitutional as applied to him in his situation. The court found that proof beyond a reasonable doubt was a primary requirement for the admission of extraneous offense evidence at the punishment stage rather than a part of the state's case, and a jury instruction on the burden of proof was not required. The court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the aggravated robbery convictions, finding that appellant did not preserve his arguments of unconstitutionality because he did not raise them during the trial and that, even if he had preserved them, he failed to show how the criminal code section was unconstitutional as it applied to him in his specific situation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of cocaine. A police officer saw defendant talking to a man in a parking lot known for drug activity and prostitution. Other officers had told the officer that defendant was a prostitute.

He searched defendant's purse and found a &quot;crack pipe&quot; containing cocaine residue. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment, as the trial court erred in not suppressing the cocaine seized as a result of the arrest. None of the factors specified in the ordinance were present in the case. Because the ordinance's listed factors were not exclusive, the court looked to see if any other facts and circumstances known to the officer when he arrested defendant would justify the warrantless arrest. The court held that the totality of all the facts and circumstances established reasonable suspicion to temporarily detain defendant, but did not give the officer probable cause to justify a warrantless arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-wife and appellee ex-husband were divorced on December 4, 1978.

Appellant made few payments and the parties renewed the note. Appellant defaulted and appellee instituted foreclosure proceedings. Appellant sought an injunction, claiming the lien was void as unconstitutional and that the interest was usurious. A temporary injunction was issued. Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment on the basis that the constitutional claim was an impermissible collateral attack on the divorce decree. Summary judgment was granted. Appellant claimed the trial court erred in refusing to recognize the constitutional prohibition of a valid lien attaching to her undivided one-half interest.

The evidence showed that appellant was arrested in a crack house, he was found in a room with the contraband, which was accessible to appellant and in plain view, and he threw the away as the police entered the room showing appellant's consciousness of guilt. The court also held that the purpose of article 1.15 was to ensure that no person was convicted of a felony on a plea of guilty without the state introducing evidence to show guilt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with criminal nonsupport of his children, a violation of Tex.

The court reversed and dismissed the indictment, finding that defendant had the right to travel from state to state and to reside in the state of his choice. The court determined that because the statute penalized defendant's fundamental right of residence choice it was invalid unless the state could show it was truly necessary to promote a compelling government interest. The court concluded that the state was unable to establish that it was necessary to classify nonresident offenders as felons in order to ease their extradition from foreign jurisdictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants quit their jobs with appellee paper company and formed their own paper company. Appellee filed suit against them alleging that they violated noncompetition covenants, uttered false statements about appellee, used confidential information, customer lists, and trade secrets owned by appellee, and filled orders of appellee. The trial court granted appellee's motion for a restraining order and issued a temporary injunction enjoining appellants from engaging in the alleged acts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners had filed a protest with the Appraisal Review Board contending that appellee's valuation of their property was excessive. This protest was denied and appellants argued that Tex. Tax Code Ann &sect; 42.08 (1992), was unconstitutional and the trial court had erred in upholding its constitutionality. Section 42.08 required appellants to pay by certain date either the amount of taxes assessed on the property or the greater of (1) the amount of taxes not in dispute, or (2) the amount of taxes imposed in the preceding year. Appellants had paid no taxes and the forfeiture provision of the statute authorized forfeiture of a taxpayer's appellate rights if a taxpayer did not prepay taxes. The court found that the forfeiture provision of the statute furthered no additional state interest other than was already accomplished by the prepayment provision. Therefore, the court sustained appellant's points of error because the forfeiture provision created an unreasonable financial barrier on their access to the courts.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted appellee's protective order. Upon appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that appellants failed to preserve error on their argument that the notice provision of Tex. Fam. Code. Ann. &sect; 71.09(a) (1995) violated the open court's doctrine because they failed to assert that claim at the trial court. The court held that the short notice provision in the statute did not violate appellants' due process rights because it was not unreasonable or arbitrary when balanced against the purposes behind the statute to prevent family violence and preserve property. The court held that the provision requiring the trial court to set a hearing within 14 days after the filing of an application for protective order was not jurisdictional it was merely a protection for the applicant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of an adverse judgment from the 14th Judicial District Court, Dallas County, Texas, rendered in plaintiff's suit to recover damages resulting from an investment in a failed cattle marketing arrangement on the grounds that defendants' violated the Texas Securities Act, the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendants alleging violations of the Texas Securities Act and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. &sect; 17.41 et seq. (1987), common law fraud, and breach of contract. The trial court rendered summary judgment for plaintiff on the Securities Act claims, and the jury found in plaintiff's favor on the DTPA and fraud claims. The trial court also directed verdicts for defendants on plaintiff's breach of contract claims. On review, the court found that the trial court did not err in denying defendants' motion to dismiss based on forum selection clauses because the case did not involve an interpretation or construction of the contracts. Further, the court found that the evidence was both legally and factually sufficient to support the jury finding that defendants committed fraud and engaged in deceptive acts. Finally, the court held that the trial court correctly reduced plaintiff's damages to the limit provided by the DTPA because the legislature intended the treble damages to be a cap on the total damages recoverable in a DTPA action, regardless of the number of defendants. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-wife filed suit, claiming entitlement to a portion of appellee veteran's military retirement pay. The trial court declared that a portion thereof was community property that should have been divided in the divorce. The case reached the Texas Supreme Court, which reversed based on a decision of the United States Supreme Court, and rendered judgment for appellee. Congress then enacted the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA), 10 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1408, allowing states to apply family property law as it existed prior to the U.S. Supreme Court decision. Appellant returned to court and received a judgment awarding her a portion of appellant's right to retirement pay. The decision was affirmed on appeal. Based on a later amendment to the USFSPA, appellee filed suit to vacate the judgment. The trial court found in favor of appellee. The court reversed, concluding that appellant's right to a portion of appellee's retirement pay vested upon affirmation of the prior judgment, that res judicata barred reopening the prior judgment, and that the subsequent amendment of the USFSPA could not be applied retroactively to extinguish appellant's vested rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee patrolman published a list of violations of his employer's departmental rules and regulations and was thereafter demoted and terminated.

After judgment was rendered for appellee, appellant municipal employers sought further review, alleging governmental immunity and good cause. On appeal, the court reversed and rendered judgment in favor of appellant municipal employer. The court held that appellee's demotion and termination were not in violation of his right to free speech since appellant employer was immune from the illegal acts of its officials; that there was no waiver of governmental immunity for the claim under &sect; 1983, and appellant employer was liable under &sect; 1983 only for acts sanctioned or ordered by it.

</DIV>

Two years later, appellant detected a lump in her left breast, had another mammogram, a biopsy, and a radical mastectomy of her left breast. Further testing indicated a high risk for cancer in her right breast. Appellant filed a medical malpractice lawsuit four years after the initial mammography. A motion for summary judgment asserting the two-year limitation on medical malpractice was granted in favor of appellee. Appellant sought review on grounds that the evidence established that she filed within the limitations period, and that appellee failed to establish that the application of the two-year limitations period did not violate the &quot;open courts&quot; provision. The court affirmed the trial court, finding that the evidence sufficiently established that the dates of any alleged negligence were readily ascertainable, that appellant's claims did not arise from a continuing course of treatment sufficient to toll the running of limitations, and that the fact that appellant &quot;wondered&quot; about the accuracy of other women's tests was insufficient to demonstrate mental anguish.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with several offenses of obscenity in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 43.21, 43.23. Appellant filed a motion requesting that the trial court declare the statutes in violation of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The trial court denied the motion and convicted appellant, sentencing him to five days in jail and a $ 1,000 fine in each case. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, noting that the obscenity statutes historically have been held constitutional in the face of claims that they violated U.S. Const. amend. I. The court also noted that the court of criminal appeals had expressly declined to set a different standard for reviewing obscenity laws under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, even though it had the power to do so. The court declined appellant's invitation to conduct a separate analysis under the Texas Constitution, holding that it could not apply a separate test in criminal cases that was in conflict with the pronouncements of the court of criminal appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for obscenity was affirmed, because the obscenity statutes have historically been held constitutional under the First Amendment, and the court could not conduct a separate test under the Texas Constitution that conflicted with the holdings of the court of criminal appeals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was a foreign corporation.

Appellee was then joined by the State of Texas who joined to defend the validity of the statute, and filed for summary judgment. The trial court found in favor of appellees. The court reversed and held that there was no rational basis for appellees to deny appellant's open space designation, so the classification under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 25.56(3) was not rationally related to the promotion and preservation of the open-space land and violated Tex. Const. art. I &sect; 3.

The trial court found that appellant violated the terms of his probation, and it revoked the probation and sentenced appellant to prison. Appellant sought review of the judgment, arguing that the trial court erred in admonishing him in writing, rather than orally, of the consequences of his plea and that the trial court erred in failing to require the probation office to submit a supervision plan in the presentence investigation report. The court ruled that appellant was admonished in writing of the range of punishment for attempted murder and informed that any recommendation as to punishment was not binding on the trial court. Further, the court held that any error with regard to the admonishments given pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 26.13, was waived by appellant's failure to object. The court affirmed the judgment convicting appellant, concluding that appellant waived error with regard to the allegedly flawed presentence report because he failed to object to the absence of the proposed plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a trial court order, which denied his motion to suppress. Defendant contended that his reliance on assurances made by local officers, regarding a traffic offense, rendered a second warrant for his arrest unconstitutional. Defendant got a traffic ticket for driving without a license. In response to a letter, defendant sent a money order to pay the ticket. The local police later arrested defendant because he had an outstanding warrant. The warrant issued on the ground that defendant had not paid the ticket. A local officer told him that posting bail was the same as paying the fine for the ticket and he would have no more problems with the offense. Defendant was arrested again, based on a second warrant issued on the original traffic ticket, and his car was impounded. A search of the car revealed cocaine and heroin in the ashtray. On appeal, the court held that defendant's argument did not justify suppression because he did not attack the underlying affidavit for the warrant, the magistrate's role in its issuance, or the warrant's facial validity and the arresting officer's reliance on it. Accordingly, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Suppression was not justified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee corporation and another company executed two notes in favor of appellee. Appellant guaranteed the notes.

Appellant filed counterclaims asserting usury, wrongful foreclosure, libel, slander, breach of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, and fraudulent inducement. Appellee's motion for summary judgment on the two notes originally executed in its favor was granted, and the trial court rendered a take-nothing summary judgment on appellant's counterclaims for usury, wrongful corporate takeover, and wrongful foreclosure. The trial court severed the summary judgment from appellee's claims relating to the bank note and from the remainder of the counterclaims. On review, the court concluded that appellant's objection to severance was untimely and that summary judgment was proper as to all counterclaims except the wrongful corporate takeover claim. There was no such claim in appellant's pleadings, so the judgment was vacated and the order reformed. As reformed, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Texas legislature created a workers' compensation assigned risk pool promising to issue policies to employers who could not obtain workers' compensation insurance.

Appellant, state workers' compensation insurance facility, ceased indemnifying appellees for expenses incurred in the defense of risk pool litigation. The state board of insurance ordered appellant to continue to indemnify appellees and the lower court affirmed. The court affirmed holding that at the time the servicing company agreements were signed, the law did not prohibit indemnification of the servicing carriers, thus the right to indemnification was vested.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator judicial candidate claimed abuse of discretion, seeking a writ of mandamus from an order of the 150th District Court of Bexar County (Texas), where respondent judge severed and abated a negligence claim from a civil conspiracy claim, pending criminal charges against defendants. Relator sought damages from political party officials or members who allegedly negligently promoted and certified an invalid nominating petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator judicial candidate claimed abuse of discretion, seeking a writ of mandamus from an order in which respondent judge severed and abated a negligence claim from a civil conspiracy claim, pending criminal charges against defendants. Relator sought actual and exemplary damages from political party officials or members who allegedly negligently promoted and certified an invalid nominating petition. The court held that the assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination, by itself, could not be a legal basis for severance and abatement of the negligence claim while a criminal investigation proceeded. The negligence claim was vitiated since relator was prohibited from preserving defendants' testimony through oral deposition while the abatement order was in effect. The court found that severance without valid and sustaining reasons was not in the interest of judicial economy. Because the claims were based on the same factual allegations, the parties were identical, the proof required was drawn from the same events, and the abatement was clearly indefinite, the court was led to the conclusion that relator had no adequate remedy at law, and mandamus was conditionally granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted mandamus conditionally. The court could not find any legal basis for severance and abatement in the transcript or the statement of facts for the trial court's finding, and held that the order by respondent judge to sever and abate constituted a clear abuse of discretion for which relator judicial candidate had no adequate remedy on appeal. Unless the trial court rescinded its order to sever and abate, the writ would be issued.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the term &quot;offer&quot; in &quot;an offer to sell&quot; maintained its plain meaning, and that appellant's references to get &quot;it&quot; and get &quot;some&quot; were enough for a rational trier of fact to have found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant offered to sell cocaine.

The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing appellants' requested instruction, because the instruction was one which could be handled by advocacy and argument, rendering the instruction unnecessary for the jury to reach its verdict. The court held that the trial court did not err in excluding the budgets for the Fire Marshal's office, because the budgets were cumulative evidence.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(a), (e)(5)(B). The court held that the indictment was proper because it alleged the county where the offense actually occurred. The court held that the addition of certain articles to the Texas Insurance Code did not violate ex post facto principles. The court held that the jury instruction defining culpable mental states was proper because theft, as charged, was not strictly a result-oriented offense. There was no fundamental error in the trial court's failure to give an instruction as to accomplice witness testimony because the accomplice's testimony was corroborated under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.14 (1979). The court held that there was sufficient evidence to prove all elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that even if the reasonable hypothesis rule applied, appellant asserted no reasonable hypotheses. The court held that a prior federal probated sentence, which counted as a final conviction under federal law, was properly used for enhancement purposes, even though a probated sentence under Texas law was not a final conviction.</SPAN></P>

Harris County, Texas, which granted summary judgment to appellee insurers, holding they had been discharged from liability because appellant had not filed a claim as required under Tex. Ins. Code Ann. Art. 3.48 (1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant on behalf of minor children filed a claim against appellee insurance companies to recover benefits for the loss of their insured mother. Summary judgment was granted to appellees because benefits had already been paid to the named beneficiary, father of the minor children. Father was subsequently found guilty of murdering the mother. On appeal, appellant argued that Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 3.48 (1981), discharging appellees of liability, was unconstitutional because minors were unable to file notice of an adverse claim as required under the statute. Since the children had a cause of action against their father, the statute did not deprive them of their common law action. The open courts provision of the state constitution did not guarantee a recoverable judgment, it merely protected those rights which existed at common law. Appellant argued that appellees had constructive notice of the adverse claim. The court held that the decision by the sheriff, in &quot;clearing&quot; father of the crime, made appellees' payment to father proper. Since appellant had filed no adverse claim, prior to the time appellees paid the claim, the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former wife sought review of a final decree of divorce rendered by the 328th District Court, Fort Bend County (Texas), which named appellant and appellee former husband joint managing conservators of a minor child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former wife argued an entitlement to a new trial following a master's decree of divorce ruling, because she was unable to obtain a complete statement of the facts from the trial and, thus, was unable to prosecute her appeal. The court disagreed, noting first that portions of the tape recording of the proceedings were inaudible. The court observed that appellant effectively waived her right to court reporter transcribed proceedings when she failed to request the reporter's presence, as required by Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 11.14(d) (1986). And even if the waiver was not express, the absence of a record would not warrant reversal where the record's absence was the result of appellant's lack of due diligence. The court noted that appellant failed to object to a trial by a master and did not request that a reporter be provided, as allowed by Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 54.018 (1988). Further, appellant failed to seek a de novo review of the master's findings, failed to refute a finding that she had no objection to relying on a poor quality tape, and failed to have a partial fact statement prepared of audible portions or to correct any tape inaccuracies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A final decree of divorce was affirmed that named appellant former wife and appellee former husband as joint managing conservators of a minor child, because appellant was not entitled to a new trial following a decree supported only by a partially audible set of facts from a tape recording of the trial, because the absence of a record was the result of her lack of due diligence in seeking a court reporter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment, and an order denying him a new trial, from the 252nd District Court, Jefferson County, Texas, that revoked his probation on deferred adjudication, convicted him of sexual assault of a minor, and sentenced him to 99 years in prison. Appellant contended that the judgment and sentence violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII, XIV, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant received a deferred adjudication and 10 years probation on a sexual assault of a minor charge. He later pleaded true to allegations that he violated probation. These violations included leaving the jurisdiction for two years, failing to report to his probation officer, failing to wear a probation bracelet, and testing positive for marijuana. He was adjudicated guilty and sentenced to 99 years in prison. The court affirmed the judgment and sentence. The court noted that appellant was well apprised of the consequences of his failure to adhere to the terms of his probation. The court also explained that the trial court, after advising appellant that he could be sentenced to 99 years, gave him the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea and pleas of true. Thus it did not appear from the record that the trial court was so biased against sex offenders that his sentencing decision amounted to violations of appellant's constitutional rights. The court noted also that the sentence was within the range permitted by statute, and that appellant's offenses were several and bizarre.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. Although the trial court made his distaste for sex offenders clear, the procedures he adhered to in offering appellant the chance to withdraw his pleas were inconsistent with appellant's claim that the trial court was unconstitutionally biased.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Indicted for capital murder, appellant pleaded guilty to the lesser-included offense of murder. The trial court convicted appellant under the provisions of Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 1.15 (1994) and sentenced him 60 years' imprisonment. On appeal, appellant contended that art. 1.15 was unconstitutional in that it provided for a bench trial where the trial court could not consider any evidence offered by appellant, and it was therefore a denial of appellant's right to compulsory due process. The court held that nothing in art. 1.15 prohibited appellant from putting on his own evidence or prohibited the trial court from considering that evidence. The court noted that appellant did put on witnesses at the punishment hearing and was not prevented from cross-examining the state's witness. The court also rejected appellant's contention that the trial court committed fundamental error in entering a judgment of guilt because the record was silent as to his waiver of the right to compulsory process. Neither federal nor Texas law required that appellant expressly waive the right to compulsory due process, the court held. Accordingly, the court affirmed appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Having overruled all of Appellant's points of error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sought review of a take nothing judgment from the 157th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, in his action for a property tax refund. Appellant contended that the assessment of property taxes, pursuant to Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 11.01(c), on material destined for export violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, and the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding that a state tax on goods awaiting foreign export approval in appellant taxpayer's warehouse did not violate U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, or U.S. Const. amend. XIV, the court affirmed the judgment. The court applied a six factor test to determine that the tax did not violate the &quot;dormant&quot; Commerce Clause. The court found a &quot;substantial nexus&quot; between the presence of the property in the warehouse and the state. The tax did not discriminate against interstate commerce. Appellant failed to prove the tax was not fairly apportioned. It was virtually a given that the tax was fairly related to the services provided by the state. Appellant had not demonstrated more than a possibility of a risk of international multiple taxation. Finally, appellant failed to demonstrate how the tax prevented or frustrated the federal government from speaking with &quot;one voice&quot; with respect to regulating commercial relations with foreign governments. The tax also did not violate equal protection. Appellant's challenge was principally fact-based, and he cited no authority finding an equal protection violation based on an erroneous fact determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the take-nothing judgment in this refund action. The court held that the tax violated none of the six factors applicable to the test for determining whether the tax violated the &quot;dormant&quot; Commerce Clause, and found no violation of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners challenged the decision of the 237th District Court of Lubbock County (Texas), which denied appellants' summary judgment motion and granted the summary judgment motion of appellees, a city and its housing standards commission, in appellants' action to recover damages for the demolition of appellants' buildings pursuant to a housing commission order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, a city and its housing standards commission, caused the demolition of buildings owned by appellant property owners pursuant to an administrative order. After demolition, appellants sued appellees seeking damages, and a trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees. The court affirmed summary judgment against appellants. The court rejected the claim that the city ordinance authorizing the demolition order, which set forth a ten-day period for judicial appeal, violated the enabling act. Rather than apply the enabling act in effect when appellants filed suit, which required a thirty-day appeal period, the court reviewed the ordinance under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1175, &sect; 36 (1979), the enabling act in effect when the demolition order issued that did not specify an appeal period. The court held that a ten-day appeal period did not violate the open court rights in Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. Finally, the court refused to entertain arguments that the demolition order did not comply with the city ordinance and suffered other defects because these arguments constituted impermissible collateral attacks on an order that was not directly appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of appellant property owners' summary judgment motion and the grant of the summary judgment motion of appellees, a city and its housing standards commission. A city ordinance authorizing the demolition if the administrative order was not appealed within ten days did not violate the applicable enabling either act or the constitutional right to open courts.</SPAN></P>
