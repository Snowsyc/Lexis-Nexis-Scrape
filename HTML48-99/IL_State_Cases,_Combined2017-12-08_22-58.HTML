Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-4(a) (1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another man robbed the victims at gunpoint and raped the female victim. The trial court stated that it was required by statute to give defendant a consecutive sentence because he committed a Class X felony and an aggravated criminal sexual assault. On appeal, defendant challenged the consecutive nature of his sentence. The court vacated the imposition of a consecutive sentence and remanded the case for resentencing. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-4(a) (1989) did not require mandatory consecutive sentences in a case where the crimes were not part of a single objective in a single transaction. The court could not initially make the determination of whether there was a substantial change in the nature of the criminal objective from the armed robbery to the aggravated criminal sexual assault. The trial court was best suited to make such a determination, which was based upon factual considerations. The trial court purported to act pursuant to a provision that it incorrectly interpreted as mandatory when it was in fact discretionary. The court remanded the case to allow the trial court to exercise its discretion.</SPAN></P>

Stat. 5/3-6-3(3) (1992)), which prohibited an award of good-conduct time to inmates convicted of certain offenses, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates were convicted of criminal sexual assault. Section 3-6-3(3) prohibited the director of corrections from awarding good-conduct time to inmates convicted of certain crimes including criminal sexual assault. The trial court dismissed the inmates' petitions for writs of mandamus and habeas corpus. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held: (1) the statute did not violate the equal protection or due process clauses of the United States and Illinois constitutions because the classification of offenses were rationally related to a legitimate government need of alleviating prison overcrowding while reducing the risk of public harm from the early release of offenders; (2) mandamus could not be granted because there was no clear duty on the part of the director of corrections to act; (3) the amendment to the statute was not an ex post factor law because it did not criminalize an act that was not an offense when committed, increase punishment for a previously committed offense, or alter rules of evidence to make conviction of a prior act easier; and (4) the trial court had no duty to appoint counsel in a civil action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted murder and aggravated battery after he shot two victims at close range. Due to the trial court's findings that the crime was particularly brutal, defendant's sentence was extended as allowed under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3.2(b)(2) (1983). After unsuccessfully appealing his convictions and sentence, defendant's petition for post-conviction relief was also denied by the trial court. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were meritless, particularly where no prejudice was demonstrated. As to the extended sentence handed down, the court found the crimes at issue were of the type for which extended sentencing was proper. Certain claims by defendant, including his claim that the trial court erred in imposing an extended term sentence without notifying him of an intention to do so, were res judicata since defendant raised and the court addressed these same issues on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the order of the Circuit Court of Fayette County (Illinois), which convicted him after a jury trial of harassment of a witness in violation of Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a deputy sheriff, confronted a police dispatcher who had testified against him in an earlier proceeding. On appeal, the court held that evidence that defendant came to the dispatcher's office for a confrontation after verifying that she was on duty, and evidence of his shouting, threats, gestures, a disparity in size, and the fear and upset he caused, were more than sufficient to sustain the conviction by a jury that had the opportunity to listen to the evidence and to observe and assess the witnesses. The court held that the First Amendment did not protect all types of speech and that the harassment statute was not overbroad because it protected a defined class from specific behavior and it was justified by a legitimate need of society to protect witnesses. The court held the statute's wording was sufficiently clear to put a person of average intelligence on notice of the proscribed conduct, so it was not void for vagueness. The court found that there could not be a legitimate expectation of privacy in a shouting match in a municipal building and that the Eavesdropping Act was not violated by the inadvertent recording of the incident on police equipment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney contended that the circuit court's order was based upon &sect; 6 of an act, codified at 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 205/6 (1992), and that the act impermissibly encroached upon the exclusive prerogative of the state's supreme court to regulate the legal profession. The state argued that the judge had inherent power to control his courtroom and to ensure that attorneys appearing before him exhibit proper respect for the authority of the court and that the attorney lacked standing to contest the constitutionality of &sect; 205/6. The court vacated the circuit court's order because the act was an unconstitutional encroachment upon the supreme court's exclusive authority to punish or to disbar an attorney. The court found that the circuit court did not have inherent power to limit the practice of the attorney in his court and its authority to do so could only have come from the act; thus, the attorney had standing to challenge the act's constitutionality. The court concluded that the supreme court's preemption of all authority having to do with attorney discipline rendered the act unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured by an accident caused by firemen from the district while they were on duty. The district argued that the Tort Immunity Act, 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 10/5-106 (1992), and the Fire Fighter Liability Act, 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 75/1 (1992), were in direct conflict. The district argued that &sect; 10/5-106 provided immunity for public employees responding to emergency calls, but that &sect; 75/1 imposed liability upon fire protection districts thereby discriminating against the districts. The court held that the district had standing to bring the cause of action because they were being discriminated against. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court and dismissed the third count of the amended complaint. The court held that where two statutes conflicted the later enacted statute was said to take precedence over the older statute and that the dismissed count was based on a statute that had been repealed, therefore, dismissal was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, dismissed the third count of the employee's amended complaint, and remanded the cause for further action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of two counts of armed robbery and sentenced him to natural life imprisonment under the Illinois Habitual Criminal Act (Act), 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/33B-1 (1992).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At his trial for robbery, defendant objected to the introduction of evidence relating to the circumstances of his arrest. That evidence consisted of testimony that defendant had held a gun on a woman and had shot at police who were attempting to arrest him. The evidence was admitted, and defendant was convicted and sentenced to natural life imprisonment under the Act, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/33B-1 (1992). The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The trial judge's refusal to exclude the evidence relating to defendant's arrest did not deprive defendant of a fair trial and was not an abuse of discretion. Even though it included evidence regarding other crimes, the evidence was admissible to show identity, to place defendant with a gun in his hand in close proximity and time to the offense charged, and to show absence of mistake as well as the circumstances of his arrest. The probative effect of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect and was subject to a limiting instruction. The Act did not violate federal or state constitutional due process rights, was not an ex post facto law, and did not place defendant in double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting defendant of armed robbery and sentencing him to natural life imprisonment under the Act was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code &sect; 8-20-040 was not unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the ordinance did not involve constitutionally protected rights, was reasonably clear in its application to claimant, and that the ordinance's language was unambiguous and self-explanatory. Contrary to the claimant's assertion, the court further ruled that the ordinance did not delegate to the police superintendent the council's inherent function of determining what the law should have been and to whom it should have been applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to aggravated battery. The Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) sentenced him to an extended term of 10 years' imprisonment. The trial court found two of the factors justifying an extended-term sentence to be applicable. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his codefendants severely beat a fellow gang member when he indicated a desire to leave the gang. The gang rules required that any member who desired to leave had to undergo a beating. The victim was beaten into a coma and suffered permanent brain damage. The trial court found that defendant committed the offense in a brutal and heinous manner indicative of wanton cruelty pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5-3.2(b)(2) (1992) and that defendant committed the offense as part of a gang activity pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5-3.2(b)(6) (1992). The court modified the sentence to grant defendant credit for time served and then affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 5-5-3.2(b)(2) was unconstitutionally vague and overly broad. The court held that non-capital cases were analyzed under the Due Process Clause, and that a vagueness challenge under that clause could be overcome when the defendant's conduct clearly fell within the statutory definition. Here, defendant's conduct was clearly heinous and brutal. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court's judgment to give defendant credit for time served and then the court affirmed the judgment as modified. The court thereafter remanded the cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner possessed two contiguous lots, and the city approved her application for a permit to place a mobile home on one of those lots. When defendant citizens filed a complaint with the board and asked for a recission of the permit, the owner filed a request with the city to combine her two lots to satisfy the acreage requirements for zoning purposes. The board rescinded the permit, and the trial court entered judgment against the owner. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err in finding that the owner was not permitted to &quot;tack&quot; her lots because the lots were already improved with an existing structure; thus, the combining of such lots for zoning purposes freed no open space for use by another structure as required by Fairfield, Ill., Municipal Zoning Code &sect;&sect; 28.040.030, 28.12.030 (1988). The trial court did not exceed its authority by considering the lot width even though that issue had not been specifically raised by defendants. The owner waived the issue of constitutionality and failed to raise the issue of detrimental reliance at the initial hearing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also contended that defense counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate these matters. The court found that defendant's counsel's performance did not fall below the objective standard of reasonableness and that defendant was not prejudiced. The court determined that witness statements that were admitted into evidence did not violate the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.

The court reversed the judgment that denied the public defender's motion. The court set aside and vacated the general order as an improper exercise of legislative power by the judiciary. The court addressed the issue despite the absence of an actual case involving a minor. Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 (1970) provided that the legislative, executive, and judicial branches were separate and that no branch could exercise powers properly belonging to another. The court held that the general order created a law, and therefore the circuit court improperly exercised legislative power.

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(b)(6) (1989), 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1(b)(6) (1992), was present.</SPAN></P>

The jury determined that defendant was not eligible for the death penalty and he was sentenced by the court to a natural-life term in prison based on a finding that the &sect; 9-1(b)(6) aggravating factor was present. The court affirmed and held that (1) statutory accountability principles that incorporated the &quot;common-design&quot; rule made a defendant responsible for a wide range of consequences for criminal acts; (2) defendant's conduct was comparable to conduct in other cases where extended-term or natural-life sentences were upheld; (3) there was no showing that the victim impact statements improperly influenced the sentence; and (4) the trial court did consider defendant's show of remorse and the evidence of defendant's emotional or mental condition but determined that it deserved little weight in the sentence and the evidence did not preclude a finding of exceptionally brutal or heinous behavior.</SPAN></P>

After a bench trial, the trial court found for the bank. The department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank loaned money to the corporation to operate a grain elevator. The department suspended the corporation's licenses and assumed control of the corporation. The bank asserted a lien over the corporation's accounts receivable. But the department claimed a superior lien under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 40.23 (1991). The bank elected not to pursue its administrative remedies under Ill. Admin. Code tit. 8, &sect;&sect; 1,10-1.500 (1991). The trial court ruled that the bank's lien had priority. The court held that a party aggrieved by administrative action had to exhaust its administrative remedies before seeking judicial review. Although the department failed to raise in the trial court the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies, the issue was not waived. Waiver was not a limitation on the court's jurisdiction. Exhaustion was not required where a statute was attacked on its face. But the bank challenged only the department's interpretation and application of the law, not the constitutionality of the law on its face. Even clear indications that the department would rule adversely to the bank did not render exhaustion of administrative remedies futile.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, in the bank's action for declaratory and injunctive relief, reversed the trial court's order that the bank's lien was superior to that of the department.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff restaurant owner appealed a decision from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which affirmed the decision of defendant Liquor Appeal Commission of the City of Chicago (commission), which affirmed the Mayor's License Commission's decision, which denied him a liquor license. The restaurant owner had brought his action against the commission and defendant mayor pursuant to Ill. Code Civ. P., 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-101.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurant owner opened his business, and then sought a liquor license but was ultimately denied by the commission. The restaurant owner sought judicial review, and the trial court affirmed the decision of the commission. The restaurant owner appealed, and the court affirmed in part and reversed in part the decision of the trial court. The court held that the restaurant owner did not prove the two prerequisites necessary to invoke the doctrine of equitable estoppel. There was no evidence that the restaurant owner relied upon the city's actions to his detriment. The restaurant owner did not demonstrate that, in the absence of estoppel, he would suffer a substantial loss. The court held that the trial court erred when it did not address the restaurant owner's argument that 235 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/6-11 was unconstitutional. The court found that 5/6-11 was not unreasonable in requiring that a school be 100 feet from an establishment that served liquor where the population of the city was more than 500,000 persons. The legislature could have reasonably concluded that there was a greater likelihood of school children coming into contact with intoxicated individuals or alcohol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state division of water resources (DWR) appealed from the order of the Circuit Court of DuPage County (Illinois), which denied statutory injunctive relief. The DWR sought a mandatory injunction against plaintiff corporation to remove two berms and a lift station that it constructed adjacent to its properties along a creek.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation built a shopping center along a creek. The corporation constructed a berm at the shopping center without a permit. The corporation later built a hotel and applied for a permit to continue the berm. The corporation brought the instant action when its occupancy permit for the hotel was denied and the DWR counterclaimed for an injunction to compel the corporation to remove both berms, for the shopping center and for the hotel. The court first held that DWR had statutory power to make administrative decisions to designate floodplain and issue permits under the section 18f of the Rivers Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 65f (1987). Exhaustion of administrative remedies was required in accordance with the Administrative Review Law, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 19, para. 75a (1987). The court affirmed the trial court's denial of an injunction as it pertained to the shopping center berm because removing the berm could be disastrous for the shopping center and because the berm was constructed years earlier. However, the court reversed the denial of an injunction as it pertained to the hotel berm because DWR had full administrative authority to regulate floodplains.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the injunction relating to the hotel berm and reversed the injunction relating to the shopping center berm. Regarding the details of the permit application, the court held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to review the permit conditions because the corporation failed to seek review from DWR pursuant to the Administrative Review Law within the designated 35-day period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was charged with driving under the influence and she was sent a notice that her driver's license had been suspended pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501(a)(2). The driver alleged that she was traveling along a road and swerved into a culvert to avoid a car in her lane. She was knocked unconscious but claimed that she had consumed two drinks. At the hospital, she was given medicines and had blood drawn, before being taken to the intensive-care ward, at the request of the responding officer because he detected alcohol. The court determined that the driver had the burden of proving that the suspension should be rescinded because she was the one who suffered the suspension. The court held that the circuit court's ruling which denied the state's motion for a finding and that the state made a prima facie case was not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence because there was a concern with the validity of the blood test. The court gave great deference to the circuit court's ruling because it had the benefit to determine the credibility of the witnesses and if the prima facie case was made, the proof of the validity of the blood test clearly failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While traveling northbound, the defendant's vehicle collided head-on with an automobile travelling southbound. The defendant had no recollection of the accident and was uncooperative at the hospital. There was evidence of a report of defendant's blood alcohol level and testimony that he smelled of alcohol, but the trial court failed to make a requisite finding of intoxication beyond a reasonable doubt. On appeal, the court found that under the instructions given, it was possible for the jury to have concluded that the defendant had recklessly driven his vehicle across the center line and into the oncoming lane of traffic even if it was not convinced that he had been under the influence of alcohol. Although the verdict necessarily incorporated a finding of reckless driving, it did not necessarily establish that the defendant was proven beyond a reasonable doubt to have been under the influence. Absent such a determination, the court had to conclude that the trial court committed reversible error in sentencing defendant pursuant to the enhanced penalty provision of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-3(e) (1992), rather than under the standard penalty range of two to five years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the defendant's conviction for reckless homicide but vacated his five-year sentence and remanded the matter for resentencing as a Class 3 felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that found him guilty of possession with the intent to deliver more than 15 and less than 100 grams of a controlled substance containing cocaine and sentenced him to prison. Defendant argued that his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to effective assistance was denied, his motion to suppress should have been granted, resentencing was necessary, and improper closing remarks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A narcotics detection dog alerted the detective to an envelope addressed to defendant, and after further investigation, the substance within the envelope tested positive for cocaine. The trial court denied defendant's pretrial motions to suppress, which claimed that the detective did not have probable cause or reasonable suspicion to seize the envelope. Defendant was subsequently found guilty of possession with the intent to deliver more than 15 and less than 100 grams of a controlled substance containing cocaine and sentenced to prison. The court found that the failure to file a pretrial motion to quash defendant's arrest rose to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel because warrant was limited to the envelope and the police searched defendant's house. The court also found that the motion to suppress should have been granted because the detective admitted that there was nothing unusual about the envelope that supported a reasonable, articulable suspicion that the envelope contained contraband. The testimony of defendant's minor daughter, who witnessed defendant's arrest should have been admitted. The court reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, holding that the detective did not have sufficient facts to support a reasonable, articulable suspicion that the envelope at issue contained contraband.

The court did not address defendant's contention regarding improper remarks during closing argument.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the trial court did not err in finding that defendant failed to make a prima facie showing of discrimination in the state's exercise of its peremptory challenges against black males. The court found that defendant's instruction on involuntary manslaughter was properly denied.

The trial court imposed two 20-year sentences of imprisonment for aggravated criminal sexual assault, to be served consecutively, and a concurrent 20-year term of imprisonment for home invasion was imposed, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was chased into an apartment building by the victim's father and neighbors, and subsequently arrested by police. In affirming the denial of his motion to quash his arrest, the court held that there was probable cause to arrest defendant based upon the fact that a crime had been committed, and a victim had positively identified defendant. The court affirmed defendant's mandatory consecutive sentences, noting that he had asked the court to rule on the propriety of such sentences based upon the outcome of another pending appeal, and had waived any other argument regarding the issue by relying solely on the outcome of that decision and not advancing any further arguments or citation to authority for the trial court to consider. The court stated that a reviewing court was not simply a depository into which the appealing party could dump the burden of argument and research. In addition, the court stated that a constitutional challenge to the mandatory consecutive sentences applied in the case would necessarily have failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which convicted him of one count of home invasion and three counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault based on bodily harm, and sentenced him to concurrent terms of imprisonment on the home invasion and one aggravated assault counts, and to concurrent terms of imprisonment on the other two aggravated assault counts, to run consecutively to other two sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant broke into a home and sexually assaulted the female occupant three times. He was convicted of one count of home invasion and three counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault premised on bodily harm, and was sentenced to concurrent prison terms on the home invasion and one aggravated assault count, and to concurrent prison terms on the other two aggravated assault counts, to run consecutively to other two sentences. Defendant appealed, claiming that the mandatory imposition of consecutive sentences under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4(a) (1992) violated constitutional equal protection and due process requirements. The court affirmed the convictions, but vacated the sentences and remanded for resentencing. The challenged statute, which was applicable to defendant's commission of three sexual assaults, did not offend principles of equal protection and due process because its classifications were not arbitrary and it bore a rational relationship to a legitimate legislative purpose. However, the trial court imposed a combination of concurrent and consecutive sentences that appeared to be inconsistent with the statute, and gave no explanation for its action in the record.</SPAN></P>

The victim was also a former gang member who was made to undergo a three-minute &quot;violation,&quot; or beating, in order to be released from gang membership. The first issue raised by defendants on appeal is whether the state's evidence failed to prove either defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt under the theory of accountability. The court affirmed both defendants' convictions and found no error in the record. The court held that the state's evidence was sufficient to prove defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt under the theory of accountability. Although the testimony varied as to the details of the procedure, it was not disputed that the gang members intended to &quot;violate&quot; those members wishing to leave the gang. There is no question that the victim was beaten and sustained great bodily harm. It was also undisputed that both defendants were present during the commission of the beating.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for unlawful delivery of a controlled substance. The day after defendant was released on bail, the trial court, relying on the grand jury's finding of probable cause, issued a second warrant for his arrest on the same charge.

The court affirmed the order. No statute authorized the trial court, which already had jurisdiction over defendant, to issue a warrant for his arrest merely because he was indicted in the same court for the same offense. Thus, the arrest warrant was invalid. The trial court erred in holding that the &quot;good-faith&quot; doctrine was inapplicable to the warrant because the warrant was based upon a grand jury's determination of probable cause. Regardless, the good-faith exception did not apply. The procurement and execution of the first warrant was historical facts which the officers knew or should have known at the time the second warrant was issued. Thus, the officers had no reasonable grounds to believe that the warrant was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for criminal sexual assault was affirmed by the court on direct appeal. Defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-1 et seq. (1992), alleging numerous violations of his constitutional rights. The petition was supported by affidavits and exhibits. The trial court dismissed defendant's petition, without an evidentiary hearing, as being patently without merit. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that on direct appeal defendant was not denied his constitutionally guaranteed right to counsel. Based on the court's prior determination, the issue of whether defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel was res judicata. Accordingly, the court concluded that defendant's first alleged constitutional violation was barred by principles of res judicata and that defendant could not overcome these principles with factual statements. Moreover, the court concluded that defendant's other claims were also without merit.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501(a)(5) (1990), 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-501(a)(5) (1992). Defendant appealed and contended that &sect; 11-501(a)(5) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was arrested, he admitted that he had been smoking marijuana and he underwent a blood and urine test, which revealed a small amount of cannabis. Defendant contended that &sect; 11-501(a)(5) was unconstitutional because it failed to specify a requisite mental state as an element of the offense, violated due process and equal protection guarantees, and was vague. The court held that (1) defendant had standing to challenge &sect; 11-501(a)(5); (2) the trial court was not required to determine defendant's state of mind at the time of the offense because &sect; 11-501(a)(5) imposed strict liability and defendant's intent was immaterial to the question of guilt; (3) the provision was not void for vagueness because it clearly prohibited individuals from driving with any amount of a controlled substance unlawfully in their systems and punished only those who had already knowingly ingested illegal substances; and (4) the provision did not violate due process or equal protection guarantees because it was rationally related to the State's legitimate interest in protecting the public from drivers whose driving ability was impaired by the consumption of controlled substances.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, finding that defendant appeared in court on the proper date and was not prejudiced by the typographical error. Moreover, the creditor, as a federally chartered corporation, was not a foreign corporation under Illinois law and was not required to obtain a certificate of authority from the state to transact business or sue in Illinois. The court held that the answer in abatement was properly stricken because it was an unverified document.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of having committed two counts of armed robbery at a Wendy's restaurant while with two accomplices. After the trial court denied a post-trial motion for a new trial that defense counsel had filed, the trial court was presented with a pro se motion from defendant entitled &quot;Petition for Compulsory Process,&quot; which the trial court refused to consider. On appeal, defendant contended, inter alia, that the trial court improperly omitted the issue of mental state from the jury instructions. The court, in affirming the trial court's judgment, rejected this contention, holding that because armed robbery was a general intent crime, a particular mental state was not a necessary element of the crime. For general intent crimes, a mental state of intent, knowledge, or recklessness was necessarily implied by the circumstances of the crime. Further, the court ruled that even if the trial court's failure to consider defendant's post-trial petition as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim constituted error, it was harmless error because it related to failure to call a witness, a matter of trial strategy which did not support an ineffective assistance claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county passed an impact fee ordinance pursuant to former Ill. Rev.

The court found that (1) the impact fees were not takings in violation of the Fifth Amendment because the formula used by the county imposed fees only on the road improvement costs generated by the new development and the new developments received a direct and material benefit from the road improvements; (2) the impact fees did not violate the Uniformity Clause of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 (1970), because there was a real and substantial difference between those new developments that generated additional traffic and the existing developments that did not; (3) the enabling legislation was not local legislation in violation of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 (1970) because there was a reasonable basis for limiting operation of the legislation to communities of a certain size; and (4) the appeals section of the county ordinance did violate due process because it imposed a penalty for pursuing an appeal, however, that section was severable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted, in absentia, of aggravated arson. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment. The court reversed because the jury was asked to determine the defendant's fate and provided with verdict forms that did not allow them to find him not guilty of any arson related offenses. There was a reasonable probability that the error had the effect of removing from the jury's consideration the elements of arson, conveying the message that it was the jury's duty only to determine whether the aggravating factor of the greater offense was present, thus directing a verdict of guilty on the charge. The error undermined the reliability of the verdict and was not harmless. Finally, during sentencing, the trial judge improperly considered in aggravation that defendant's conduct threatened harm to others when that fact was implicit in the offense for which he was charged.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that defendant made no offer to distinguish particular family members from neighbors and collateral relatives among the spectators. The court held that &sect; 115-11 did not conflict with U.S. Const. amend. VI's purpose of abolishing secret trials. The court found that the record sufficiently supported the trial court's decision to clear the courtroom while the child victim testified. The court noted that defendant failed to identify any immediate family when asked by the trial court. The court held that the Waller criteria did not apply to &sect; 115-11.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals, were barred from entering a housing complex. The individuals contended that the management and owners of the complex, the city and two police officers, violated their common law, statutory and constitutional rights. The lower court granted summary judgment to defendants. The individuals contended that they were invited onto the premises by certain tenants and had common law and statutory rights. The court determined that the individuals did not have common law or statutory rights to enter the complex because the tenants were not plaintiffs in the proceeding and that the lease agreement with tenants provided management the right to bar individuals from the property. The individuals alleged that the police's practice of recommending who was to be placed on the no trespass list created a close nexus between the actions of the police and the management of the complex to make the action of the management that of the city. The court found that the conduct of the management of the complex could not have been treated as that of the city or the police to establish the necessary state action for a constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that: (1) the evidence presented at trial supported the first-degree murder conviction because it did not show that the victim was the aggressor, the danger of harm was imminent, unlawful force was threatened by the victim, or that defendant used the kind of force necessary to avert danger; (2) because the evidence was insufficient to reduce the conviction to second-degree murder or to affirmatively raise the issue of self-defense, defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on those issues, and the burden did not shift to the state to disprove the existence of justification; (3) the trial court did not err in excluding irrelevant testimony concerning the victim's gang membership.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-3(e) (1991), 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-3(e) (1992).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant illegally drove his car into an intersection while under the influence of alcohol, struck a car and killed a passenger in that car. He pleaded guilty to reckless homicide, a Class 3 felony, but the charge was enhanced to a Class 2 felony and the 10-year sentence rendered was four years under the maximum for that felony. On appeal, the court found that he had to demonstrate clearly the alleged constitutional violation. The court found that the Equal Protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, did not require equal treatment of differently situated classes of persons, and that where no fundamental right was at stake, the legislature could differentiate between similarly situated persons if there was a rational reason for doing so. The court ruled that it was rational to impose a more harsh penalty for the crime because of the state's police interest in deterring driving while under the influence of alcohol, and that a double enhancement of a penalty was permissible and was given effect where it was clear that the legislature intended such a result. The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the trial court erred by giving the jury two issues instructions on first degree murder and by excluding evidence regarding his state of mind.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A witness testified that after hearing a loud commotion in his house, he went inside and saw defendant, who was living with his mother, holding a knife in his right hand. The witness saw the deceased sitting in a chair with a small bloodstain on the left side of his chest. A jury convicted defendant of first degree murder. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court's jury instructions properly conveyed the relationship between first degree murder and the lesser offense of second degree murder by apprising the jury that once it found that the state had proved the elements of first degree murder, it was required to determine whether a mitigating factor had been proved to reduce the offense to second degree murder. Defendant was afforded ample opportunity to establish his state of mind at the time of the stabbing. Although the prosecutor's erroneous statement of the law of self-defense was improper, the statement was not prejudicial to defendant in light of the overwhelming evidence against defendant, including defendant's own testimony admitting that he stabbed the deceased and a witnesses' testimony that the deceased did not push or threaten defendant.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1505(a)(3) (1991) (now 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 570/505(a)(3) (1992))).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue of first impression was whether the mere existence of a controlled substance on the person of a vehicle occupant subjected the vehicle to forfeiture. Defendant was stopped in his truck due to a warrant which had issued for his failure to appear on a traffic violation. The police officer searched defendant. Defendant had a clear plastic straw in his right interior coat pocket and a plastic bag containing cocaine in his underwear. The State argued that the trial court erred in denying the complaint for forfeiture of defendant's truck because it &quot;facilitated&quot; defendant's possession of the cocaine within the meaning of the forfeiture statute. The court held that where the use of the vehicle was entirely incidental to the possession of the controlled substance, it did not make the possession &quot;easier or less difficult&quot; as required by the key word &quot;facilitate&quot; in the forfeiture statute. Defendant did not use the vehicle in any manner to make or try to make possession easier. Rather, the controlled substance was already secreted on his person, and the use of the vehicle did not in any manner &quot;facilitate&quot; this violation of the Act.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court rejected defendant's assertion that the trial judge improperly responded to a jury inquiry as to whether defendant could speak English because the record did not reflect that such an interchange took place. A jury instruction properly created a permissive presumption by stating that the attempted luring &quot;may be considered&quot; evidence of other than a lawful purpose. The child abduction statute created only a permissive inference and did not improperly place on defendant the burden of proving lawful purpose.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois) granted summary judgment to plaintiffs, various corporations and partnerships (companies), against defendants, the Department of Labor (Department) and others. The circuit court granted attorney fees to the companies under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 1014.1(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act. At issue was the Prevailing Wage Act (Wage Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 39s-1 et seq. (1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department hired a general contractor, which hired a quarrying company, which hired one of the companies to perform trucking. The drivers were employed by the companies. The Department determined that the drivers were entitled to prevailing wages under the Wage Act. The trial court, however, found that the companies were exempt from the provisions of the Wage Act and that the Department's interpretation to the contrary was improper rulemaking. The companies sought attorney fees. The court found that the drivers were engaged in transportation by sellers and suppliers of materials and, as such, they were expressly excluded from coverage of the Wage Act. The fact that the drivers dumped the material where it would be used was not dispositive. Only employees of contractors or subcontractors were covered by the Wage Act. The drivers were engaged in the transportation of the materials and were, therefore, properly excluded from coverage. The court further found that the Department did not engage in rulemaking, but merely interpreted the statutory language of the Wage Act. There was no improper rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's order finding the companies exempt from the provisions of the Wage Act. The court reversed the circuit court's order determining that the Department engaged in improper rulemaking. The award of attorney fees was also reversed.</SPAN></P>

He appealed from his conviction, arguing that the trial judge erred by denying him the right to present closing argument at trial, that his appointed counsel abdicated her responsibility at trial, and that the trial judge erred when he did not obtain a proper waiver of defendant's right to counsel. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that defendant was not denied an opportunity to argue his case to the trial court. The court found that defendant would have asked to present closing arguments if he had wanted to repeat the defects in the state's case. Although the trial judge erred by failing to make a record that defendant knew about and expressly waived his right to present closing argument, the error was harmless. The court also held that defense counsel's forbearance from cross-examining a witness did not deny defendant his right to effective assistance of counsel. Although defendant did not waive his right to counsel at his sentencing, the court found that defendant's ineffective waiver was harmless because he knew of his right to have counsel represent him.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted of all the charges. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions for the illegal operation of a snowmobile and operation of a snowmobile without a license and reversed the other three convictions. The court held that the definition of vehicle in the general provisions of the Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/1-101 et seq., did not apply to snowmobiles. In fact snowmobiles were expressly excluded from the definition of vehicle under 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/1-217 (1992).

Defendant appealed, contending that his behavior fell outside the purview of the battery statute, that the battery statute was unconstitutionally vague, that there was insufficient evidence presented at trial to constitute proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the trial court shifted the burden of proof to defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that it was perfectly reasonable for the trial court to have found that the medical procedure became an insulting and provoking contact once the patient realized that defendant was using the rectal examination as a vehicle to bring about his own sexual gratification, that the patient's testimony was clear and convincing and supported the finding of guilt, and that the trial judge knew the proper standards and applied them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax collector billed defendant taxpayers as the operators of the wells for the property tax on the entire seven-eighths working interest rather than just the fractional undivided share that each owned. The taxpayers paid only the amount attributable to their individual fractional ownership interests, and the tax collector thereafter sold the entire working interest in each lease at a tax sale to satisfy the property tax due from the entire working interest. On review, the court affirmed. The court found that the owners of the working interest obviously had a property interest, yet the regulation itself contained insufficient procedural safeguards to ensure that the owner had adequate notice and opportunity for a hearing prior to being deprived of property pursuant to a delinquent-tax sale. The court determined that individual notice to all holders of a working interest was more burdensome, but those burdens did not outweigh an individual's guarantee of due process under the law. The court concluded that the regulation was facially invalid as applied and deprived the owners of the undivided working interest of the leases without due process and equal protection of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, Village of Arlington Heights, its building commissioner, and zoning board of appeals denied plaintiff cemetery's request for a permit to build a mausoleum. The cemetery filed a declaratory judgment action and alleged that a special use permit was not required, or that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted defendants' motion for judgment in their favor. The cemetery appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The construction of the ordinance was a question of law, which the court reviewed de novo. The court also sought the plain meaning of the ordinance's wording. The cemetery argued that when the Village wished a particular use to be deemed separate and distinct, the Village gave it a separate listing in the ordinance's index or defined it. However, the ordinance's use table contained the words cemeteries, crematories, or mausoleums on a single line, and there was no definition for these terms. Under the ordinance, special use permits were needed for cemeteries, crematories, or mausoleums. The use of the disjunctive indicated the intent to draw a distinction among the words used. Thus, the Village intended that the two words be considered separate uses. Also, among the purposes of the ordinance was regulation of the intensity of land use and prevention of overcrowding. In this light, a definition of &quot;cemetery&quot; did not include mausoleums. The latter were above ground structures, which afforded more intense use of the same land. Accordingly, the court held a mausoleum was a use separate and distinct from that of a cemetery, and the cemetery was required to obtain a special use permit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contended that the property included in the petition that made the petition defective was included inadvertently and that the trial court should have allowed them to amend the petition to bring it into conformity with Ill.

Appellees responded that the inclusion of the improper parcels rendered the petition void ab initio and the trial court, therefore, lacked jurisdiction to consider its amendment. The court reversed the trial court's order. The court found that the trial court could and should have entertained appellants' motion to amend the petition because the petition was sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the court for purposes of subsequent amendment. The court held that the Code of Civil Procedure, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 1-101 et seq. (1989), which applied to procedural matters that were not regulated by the Park District Code, provided for amendment to the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of, and sentence for, home invasion, residential burglary, theft under $ 300, and two counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault from the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Illinois). Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in denying his motion for continuance to allow DNA testing, the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt his guilt of aggravated criminal sexual assault, and other errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant waived any error in the denial of his motion for continuance when he failed to file a post-trial motion. Also, the motion for a continuance was untimely. Defendant filed the motion three days before trial, which would have required a delay of up to six months in a case already more than three years old. Defendant had already filed other motions, including one for continuance, and obtained rulings on them some three months earlier. If defendant believed DNA testing would exonerate him, he should have made the proper motion earlier. The evidence was sufficient to establish guilt of criminal sexual assault by causing bodily harm to the victim in transmitting a sexual disease. The victim testified that she did not have gonorrhea before the assault, but was infected with the disease afterward. Tests conducted on defendant after the assault revealed he was infected with the same strain of gonorrhea. Conviction for two aggravated sexual assaults was warranted when defendant committed multiple rapes on the victim during one criminal episode. Defendant's sentence was not excessive when his actions at the time of the offenses and afterward revealed little rehabilitative potential.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), defendant was convicted of possession with intent to deliver more than 900 grams of a substance containing cocaine in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1401(a)(2) (1987). He was sentenced to the minimum term of 15 years' imprisonment. On appeal, defendant maintained that the statute under which he was sentenced was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the provision under which he was sentenced was unconstitutional because it violated the due process and proportionate penalties provisions of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 11 (1970). The State argued that there were no constitutional infirmities in the statute, which was reasonably related to legislative concerns about the harmful consequences of the distribution of large quantities of cocaine. The court found no reason for reversal. The mandatory minimum sentences imposed for drug trafficking crimes were not clearly irrational or wholly disproportionate to the offense committed. The imposition of greater sentences and mandatory minimum terms for the possession and delivery of cocaine reflected the seriousness of the offense, and was reasonably designed to remedy the evils of drug trafficking and its attendant social repercussions. Accordingly, the court found no reason to depart from the presumptive validity of the legislative enactment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the circuit court were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) granted summary judgment to the village on four counts and dismissed two counts. The claimants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning ordinance changed the classification of a residential subdivision, modifying the minimum lot size required for development. The claimants had agreed to purchase lots in the subdivision prior to the zoning ordinance change. After the change, the village advised the claimants that development of one lot was not permitted and that a variation was required prior to the development of a second lot. The claimants argued that the denial of their application for a map amendment to rezone was arbitrary and capricious and that the subject lots were suitable for development. The court set forth the factors used to determine whether a zoning ordinance was valid and held that there was an issue of material fact precluding summary judgment. The claimants also sought an injunction to enjoin the village from enforcing the zoning ordinance. The court found that the claimants had constructive notice of the proposed zoning changes at the time the claimants made expenditures and that summary judgment against the claimants on that issue was proper. Nor did the rezoning violate 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-13-1 by depriving the claimants of using the lots for a lawful purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment as to the claimants request for an injunction but reversed the grant of summary judgment denying the claimants request for a map amendment to rezone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guardians of the victim brought an action against the driver for injuries to the victim by the alleged negligence of the driver in operating his automobile. The driver's answer included affirmative defenses alleging that the victim was more than 50 percent of the proximate cause of the injury. The trial court granted the driver's motion in limine barring the guardians' expert witnesses, a pharmacist and an accident reconstructionist. The court granted the driver's motion for a directed verdict, finding that no negligence on the driver's part had been shown. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the overwhelming evidence had shown that the proximate cause of the victim's injuries were his own conduct, and any such inference from the driver's failure to see the victim in the roadway was not sufficient to overcome the directed verdict. The court held that the trial court had abused its discretion in granting the driver's motion in limine to bar evidence of the expert pharmacist because evidence to show that the drinking resulted in intoxication had been lacking, however the expert reconstructionist's opinion would not have aided in the resolution of the dispute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed. On appeal, the court held that defendant's motion to quash the arrest and to suppress her confession was properly denied because under the totality of the circumstances, the warrantless arrest was proper. The information regarding defendant as to her physical description and the location of her residence from two eyewitnesses provided probable cause. Improper comments by the trial court did not require reversal of the conviction because defendant failed to show they were a substantial factor in the conviction. Defendant waived her objection to limits put on defense counsel's questioning of various witnesses by failing to raise the issues with adequate specificity in her motion for new trial. Defendant was not entitled to a second degree murder instruction based on serious provocation because the evidence indicated that defendant was the instigator of the physical fight and the victim was an unarmed and unwilling participant defending herself.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and appealed the conviction asserting, inter alia, that he acted in self-defense or, alternatively, even if his belief that his life was in imminent danger was unreasonable, a conviction for second degree murder would have been appropriate. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that a rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of first-degree murder were established beyond a reasonable doubt and that the state sufficiently refuted the assertion of self-defense. The court found that both testimonial and physical evidence suggested that defendant fired multiple shots while the victim was retreating and that the bullets missing from defendant's gun corresponded with the number of wounds sustained by the victim in the back of the head, neck, and leg. The court also found that defendant's offense should not have been reduced because the evidence sufficiently established that defendant, and only defendant, had a gun, which he fired repeatedly at the victim as he sought to retreat and defendant did not contest the sentence imposed by the lower court.</SPAN></P>

The mother appealed and the court reversed, holding that because the prior statute of limitations had been held to be unconstitutional, it conferred no rights and the putative father had acquired no vested rights by the expiration of the limitations period provided by prior law. Because no vested rights had been acquired under the prior statute, retroactive application of the new statute of limitations did not violate the putative father's due process rights by reviving a previously barred cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of two judgments of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that convicted him for aggravated criminal sexual assault and home invasion for two separate incidents. On appeal, he raised several arguments including that he was denied a fair trial in each instance, and that the jury was not correctly instructed on the state's burden of proof in the second trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual assault and home invasion in two separate circumstances, and sought review of both convictions in a consolidated appeal. On appeal, he contended inter alia that he was denied a fair trial in each instance, and that the jury was not correctly instructed on the state's burden of proof. The court held that: (1) defendant's confession was voluntary under the Illinois Juvenile Act, as a youth officer was present and spoke with defendant prior to the confession; (2) admission of evidence concerning defendant's sexual assault of one victim in his trial for the attack on second victim, did not deprive defendant of a fair trial, as that evidence served to delineate defendant's modus operandi; and, (3) in view of the multiple instructions given to the jury at trial the jury was adequately informed on state's burden of proof even though the trial court did not give a certain instruction requested by defendant. The matter was remanded for resentencing on defendant's conviction for aggravated criminal sexual assault. The trial court's judgment was thus affirmed on the convictions, and reversed and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment that convicted defendant for two instances of home invasion and aggravated criminal sexual assault was affirmed. Defendant was not denied a fair trial when state introduced evidence of his one aggravated sexual assault and home invasion offense, as that evidence went to delineate defendant's modus operandi for the second offense. The was reversed in part and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 110, par. 2-619. The dispositive issue was whether the court of claims had exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over the litigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The not-for-profit corporation, an educational and training service provider, contracted with the independent contractors to serve as instructors. A dispute arose when the contractors left the corporation's service and went to work for the state university. The trial court granted the contractors' and the university's motion to dismiss the corporation's action for damages, an injunction and other relief. The issue was whether the trial court had subject matter over the corporation's claims. The court affirmed because the court of claims had exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over the action. The court of claims also had exclusive jurisdiction over the issuance of injunctive relief because its jurisdiction was not limited to monetary claims. In addition, the court of claims had jurisdiction to grant such equitable relief as an accounting and a constructive trust. In addition, &sect; 8(d) of the Court of Claims Act gave the court of claims jurisdiction over claims against the university that sounded in tort. Finally, the court of claims had jurisdiction over claims against the university under the Illinois Trade Secrets Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 140, par. 351 et seq.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court granted summary judgment to defendants and the citizen appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the circuit court. The court held that there was a reasonable basis for the Act's authorization of the collection of additional filing fees upon remand of a cause from a reviewing court and such fees were being imposed for purposes relating to the operation and maintenance of the circuit court. The imposition of a refiling fee upon remand was ostensibly for a court related purpose. The court found that there were some additional services that were performed that were in addition to the services that were normally required at the initial filing of a case. The court held that under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 307(a), the citizen could not raise the circuit court's denial of injunctive relief for the first time on appeal. 134 Ill. 2d R. 307(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was stopped for a traffic violation, he failed to produce his driver's license. His vehicle was searched and drugs were found. Defendant was arrested and prosecuted. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of his arrest arguing the fact that he actually had a valid license made his arrest unwarranted. The trial court denied the motion and defendant was convicted. Defendant argued for reversal of his conviction on the basis that he was found guilty on the strength alone of the evidence discovered as the product of what he described as an illegal seizure. According to defendant, the Fourth Amendment prohibited all seizures, even those which followed the commission of offenses, which were not reasonable. The conviction was affirmed based upon the holding that defendant was seized for what the officer had probable cause to believe was the commission of what was determined to be a misdemeanor, the driving of a motor vehicle without being licensed. The court reasoned the seizure was effected in response to the commission of an act, which the legislature had chosen to define as a crime, and thus, was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 34-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 122, para. 34-8.3(g) clearly and unambiguously granted the employees a contract by operation of law, the subsequent actions of the board which resulted in the employees' termination or reassignment violated those contractual rights. The court held that following the rules of statutory construction and utilizing the plain meaning of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 34-8.3(g), the legislature intended to create a contract with the employees effective until the date of termination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of aggravated criminal sexual assault, criminal sexual assault, and unlawful restraint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted of aggravated criminal sexual assault, criminal sexual assault, and unlawful restraint, alleged multiple errors on appeal. The court affirmed the conviction because, in part, the state did not need medical evidence to prove sexual penetration and did not need to allege or instruct the jury as to defendant's intent, because sexual assault was a general, not specific, intent crime. Neither did the state need to show resistance on the part of the victim if it was useless under the circumstances. The court also held that aggravated sexual assault could be established by harm to the victim immediately after and not just before the sexual act. In addition, the codefendant's plea agreement that prevented his testimony on behalf of defendant did not violate defendant's right to compulsory process because the codefendant, who still faced criminal prosecution, had a right not to testify and because there was no showing that the testimony was both material and favorable for defendant. The court also held that state's objection to certain black veniremen were did not violate defendant's right to equal protection because they were for legitimate, &quot;race neutral&quot; reasons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that convicted defendant of aggravated criminal sexual assault, criminal sexual assault, and unlawful restraint because the evidence was sufficient and because the alleged procedural errors were without merit, were not preserved for appellate review, were not prejudicial, were not an abuse of the trial court's discretion, or were not a violation of defendant's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The press filed a petition to intervene, asking that the gag order be vacated and that the settlement agreement be produced. The circuit court granted the petition to intervene but, upon the motions of the convention center and the city, dismissed the petition. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the cause to the circuit court for a hearing to determine whether the city was exempted from providing the press with the information they sought under the Freedom of Information Act (Act). In so holding, the court rejected the city's arguments that the nondisclosure provision in the settlement constituted &quot;state law&quot; under &sect; 7(1)(a) of the Act, Ill. Rev.

The village denied the landfill owners' application again, and the board affirmed the denial. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case to the village with instructions to hold a new hearing.

The ex-wife's petition, filed pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-1401 (1989), specifically requested an equitable distribution of the ex-husband's military pension benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of the dissolution of the parties' marriage, federal law precluded the division of military pensions in dissolution proceedings held pursuant to state law. Effective February 1, 1983, Congress enacted the Uniform Services Former Spouses Protection Act (Act), which allowed states to divide military pensions in dissolution proceedings for pay periods beginning after June 25, 1981. In conjunction with the Act, Illinois enacted Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 510.1 (1987), which provided a legal avenue for parties to reopen marriage judgments rendered in the era when division of the military pensions was precluded. The Illinois law extended the normal two-year statute of limitations governing the modification of judgments until January 1, 1989. The ex-wife filed her petition on January 31, 1991. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) where the ex-wife filed her petition more than two years from the date her judgment became final, the trial court properly dismissed the petition for failure to comply with the two-year statute of limitations; and (2) although the ex-wife's rights to the pension were revived by the Act and extended by &sect; 510.1, she failed to timely act.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the trial court committed reversible error when it gave two first-degree murder instructions, neither of which mentioned the jury's duty to consider mitigation, before giving the second-degree murder instruction. Because the second-degree murder instruction followed the first-degree murder instructions, there was no way of knowing whether the jury considered the mitigation issue or whether it ceased deliberating because it determined that the state proved the elements of first-degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt. The second-degree murder instruction should have preceded the first-degree murder instruction. Further, the error was not harmless because there was sufficient evidence presented from which the jury could have reasonably concluded that defendant believed he was justified in using force. Additionally, the court held that the trial court erred when it excluded evidence regarding defendant's state of mind at the time he stabbed the victim, and when it gave a jury instruction on mutual combat.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board terminated the police officer's employment after finding that he had engaged in criminal conduct, including bribery and failing to make arrests, while acting as a police officer. The police officer appealed and the trial court upheld the board's determination. The police officer sought review of the trial court's decision, objecting to participation by two of the board members, claiming that the department rules were invalid because they were based on an unconstitutional delegation of police authority, and that the board's decision was arbitrary and capricious. On appeal, the court affirmed, ruling that the board members to whom the police officer objected were not required to post a bond, which was only required in disputes between the municipal officeholder and the municipality. The validity of the rules was irrelevant because the police officer was charged with violations of the criminal code. Finally, the board's decision to discharge the police officer was not arbitrary or unreasonable and was for good cause, based upon the board's findings after examining the evidence, that the police officer had engaged in criminal conduct and refused to enforce the law.</SPAN></P>

The franchisor counterclaimed for trademark infringement and for reimbursement for unpaid royalties and advertising fees. The Circuit Court of Madison County (Illinois) entered judgment for the franchisees on their complaint and for the franchisor on its counterclaim. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the franchisor to prosecute its counterclaims where it deliberately and intentionally refused to register as a foreign corporation within Illinois. The court further held that the activities that the franchisees alleged constituted the franchisor's unclean hands were activities arising from the franchisor's performance under the franchise agreements and was unrelated to the franchisor's claims of trademark infringement. The court also held that the franchisor had contractual authority to terminate the franchise agreements in the event the franchisees failed to pay royalty or advertising payments, the trial court properly refused to apply the doctrine of equitable recoupment, the trial court's finding that one of the franchisees was a proper party-plaintiff was not clearly erroneous, evidence was properly admitted, and that the jury properly found that the franchisor's willful and wanton fraudulent misrepresentation was extraneous to the breach, amounting to an independent tort for which punitive damages could be awarded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, railroad and company, filed an interlocutory appeal from an order of the Circuit Court of St. Clair County (Illinois), that denied their motions to dissolve or vacate an ex parte temporary restraining order (TRO) and entered a preliminary injunction against them. The state filed a complaint alleging violations of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2 para. 1042, 1043(a) (1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that the railroad and the company had violated the Act by their transfer and storage of waste at the railyard and that their failure to comply with the Act resulted in substantial danger to the public health of the area. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order and found that (1) the trial court had not abused its broad discretionary power by entering the TRO because a reasonable potential for harming the environment existed as a result of the railroad and company's actions; (2) that &sect; 11-101 did not apply to injunctive actions under the Act; and (3) the parties waived any complaint to the trial court's procedures by not raising the issue at the TRO hearing. The court further held that the activities complained of fell within the ambit of the Act and the terms of the preliminary injunction were not overly broad. The trial court's actions were not preempted by the Commerce Clause because they did not conflict with the Commerce Clause or any other federal law. Last, the court found that the injunction had no aspect of local protectionism, was related to legitimate environmental concerns, and did not violate interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful use of weapons. On appeal, defendant raised the following issues: (1) whether he was denied due process when the trial court permitted a witness to testify regarding conversations he had with the defendant, (2) whether 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/24-1(a)(6) of the Criminal Code of 1961 (1992) was unconstitutionally vague in language, application, and effect, and (3) whether his guilt was established beyond a reasonable doubt. In affirming, the court held that although the actual recordings of the conversations between the witness and defendant were correctly suppressed, it was proper for the trial court to allow the witness to testify regarding the substance of those conversations. The court further found no vagueness problem in 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/24-1(a)(6) because it sufficiently apprised a person of ordinary intelligence of what conduct it prohibited. Finally, a rational jury could have clearly found the elements of the crime established beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was asked to leave a building and responded by firing three shots in the direction of three people. The trial court convicted defendant of two counts of aggravated assault and two counts of the offense of aggravated discharge of a firearm. The court affirmed and held that the offense of aggravated discharge of a firearm was not a lesser included offense of the charge of aggravated assault, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-2(a)(13) (1991), because the elements of the offenses differed. The aggravated assault statute required that the victim be aware of defendant's conduct, while the aggravated discharge of a firearm statute had no such requirement. The court ruled that the imposition of longer sentences for aggravated firearm violations did not create an unconstitutionally disproportionate sentencing scheme because there were valid reasons for imposing greater penalties on those that discharged firearms as compared to those who engaged in aggravated assault. Additionally, the court held that the statute required that defendant knowingly discharge a firearm in the direction of another and that innocent conduct was not unconstitutionally punished by the firearm statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of four counts of murder and arson. The charges stemmed from a fire in an apartment building that killed four people. Defendant was questioned and taken from his home to the police station, but not formally charged. After questioning at the police station, defendant confessed to setting the fire. Defendant's appeal of his convictions raised several issues. Among them, defendant claimed that his confession should have been suppressed because his arrest was illegal. The court found, contrary to the trial court, that despite not being formally charged, defendant was arrested when he was taken from his apartment because, under the circumstances, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave. However, because the police acquired probable cause after the arrest but before defendant's statement was given, the intervening acquisition of probable cause meant that defendant's statement of confession need not be suppressed. Accordingly, defendant's convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a child care service worker attending to the everyday needs of abused or neglected children in a facility housing the children. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court convicting and sentencing defendant of aggravated criminal sexual abuse of one of the children under his care after addressing each of defendant's claimed errors on the merits. For example, the court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in admitting testimony, which insinuated that defendant &quot;was a person of bad character.&quot; Instead, the court held that the state was not attempting to portray defendant as a repeat child molester since the thrust of the state's argument was that defendant was an opportunist, taking advantage of children, when no one else was around. Furthermore, in pertinent part, the court rejected defendant's argument that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because of the failure of his counsel to preserve numerous issues for review. Rather, the court determined that each of the claimed errors was either without merit or insufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversal. Thus, the failure to preserve the issues was inconsequential.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff was unaware when he cashed a check that he was entitled to interest and damages, and he could not have intended to compromise a claim which he did not know existed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first degree murder, but convicted of second degree murder. Defendant sought review and the court affirmed the findings. The court held that the state carried its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of each element of first degree murder. But although defendant's belief that it was necessary to use deadly force to defend himself was unreasonable, it nevertheless was a mitigating factor sufficient to reduce his culpability to second degree. The court held that defendant's due process rights were not violated because the trial court correctly applied the law in finding him guilty of second degree murder. The court held that it was not unconstitutional for the legislature to require a defendant to prove a mitigating factor that would reduce a crime from first degree to second degree murder because mitigating factors were affirmative defenses and did not bear upon the ultimate burden of proof. The court held that imposition of sentence was a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court and that defendant's sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the lower court's judgment except that it vacated one conviction for criminal sexual assault. The court held that accomplice liability was proved because a rational trier of fact could have found that defendant facilitated in the commission aggravated criminal sexual assault. Defendant was present at the scene and drove the car in which the assault was committed. Nor did defendant report the incident. Moreover, defendant waived his objection to the prosecutor's comments by omitting it from his post-trial motion. The error was, however, was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt. The jury was properly charged because unanimity was required only as to guilt and any error resulting from the inclusion of accountability language did not affect the outcome of defendant's trial. Nevertheless, the court vacated one of defendant's convictions, which was improperly entered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injury victim sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that dismissed the personal injury action he had filed against defendants, Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) and its employee. The trial court held that plaintiff failed to give proper written notice as required by the &sect; 41 of the Metropolitan Transit Authority Act (Transit Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 2/3, para. 341 (1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a personal injury action against the CTA and its employee seeking to recover damages for injuries he allegedly sustained when his automobile was struck from behind by a CTA bus. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment that granted CTA's motion to dismiss. Pursuant to para. 341, plaintiff was required to file notice with the secretary of the board and the CTA's general counsel within six months of the incident. The court rejected plaintiff's &quot;substantial compliance&quot; argument, holding that he had the burden of strictly complying with para. 341. The court also found that plaintiff did not raise a material question of fact on the issue of whether the CTA was estopped from asserting his failure to give proper written notice as a bar to his claim. Therefore, the trial judge was correct in disposing of plaintiff's complaint as a matter of law. Plaintiff was not denied equal protection of the law because the differing notice and limitations periods of the Transit Act and the Tort Immunity Act bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose. The Transit Act's limitation provisions also applied to the employee.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also failed to show that the individual had been coerced into making his statement. The trial court allowed defendant to sufficiently cross-examine a detective about his experience. Defendant was not denied a fair trial by the prosecutor's comments during closing argument because he was not substantially prejudiced.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant raised two issues: 1) whether the evidence presented was sufficient to prove him guilty of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) whether the trial court erred in allowing the victim to testify by means of closed circuit television, out of the presence of defendant, pursuant to &sect; 106B-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Ill.

The court further held that the portion of &sect; 106B-1 at issue only required testimony sufficient to support the trial court's finding that the child would have suffered severe emotional distress that was likely to cause the child to suffer severe adverse effects.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the circuit court of first degree murder following a bench trial, and sentenced to 30 years imprisonment. Defendant appealed. Upon review, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court held that defendant's claim that the circuit court's admission of rebuttal testimony that the victim did not own or ever carry a gun was erroneous was waived because the claim was not raised in defendant's post-trial motion; further, the court held that, even if not waived, the admission of the testimony was not reversible error, and any error which may have occurred was harmless. The court held that defendant also waived his claim of error concerning the length of his sentence; however, again, the court held that even if the issue had not been waived, there was no reversible error, and the circuit court was within its discretion in deciding that, in light of all of the evidence, including that offered in mitigation, a 30 year sentence was appropriate. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the Illinois homicide statute violated due process because the statute had been previously considered, and had been consistently held constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's first degree murder conviction and his sentence of 30 years in the state department of corrections.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was previously convicted and sentenced for murder, rape, residential burglary, robbery, and home invasion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was previously convicted and sentenced for murder and other crimes. After exhausting his appeals for the convictions, defendant filed a post-conviction petition, which was denied by the trial court. Defendant appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of the petition. Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel due to the failure to argue that the findings of fact as to the motion to suppress were erroneous because the trial court's finding of voluntariness as to defendant's statements was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel due to the failure to argue lack of probable cause for arrest because the statement by defendant's accomplice implicating defendant attenuated any taint surrounding the arrest. Defendant was not denied his rights to equal protection and due process because the factors in mitigation and aggravation in &sect; 5-8-1(a)(1) of the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-2(a)(1) (1989), provided the necessary guidance for the trial court to decide whether a particular defendant should be sentenced to life imprisonment or to an extended term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustee, in an effort to commercially develop its parcel of residential-zoned unincorporated property, filed a petition with the county for rezoning of the property.

Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-701 (1991), seeking a declaration that the ordinances were void as to the property. The trial court held that the ordinances were unenforceable because one was beyond the home rule powers of the village and the other amounted to zoning and violated the trustee's due process rights. The village appealed, contending that the trustee lacked standing to challenge the ordinances. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trustee was an &quot;interested party&quot; as required by para. 2-701, that the village usurped the state's regulatory authority by attempting to render the village's regulation of the subject matter exclusive, that the required express grant of statutory authority was lacking, and that one ordinance was invalid because its extraterritorial scope was beyond the village's authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which rejected his theories of justified use of force and second degree murder and found him guilty of first degree murder under the Illinois murder statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1, 9- 2 (1987), which defendant alleged was unconstitutional because it violated principles of due process, equal protection, and separation of powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant testified that he shot the decedent in self-defense because the decedent had a gun. While being questioned, defendant told the police that he did not know who shot the decedent and that he did not mention that the decedent had a gun. Defendant was convicted and his conviction was upheld. The court agreed with the trial court that defendant's failure to inform the police of critical details belied his self-defense claim. Similarly, a defense witness's failure to tell police that defendant shot the deceased to protect himself further weakened the claim. Defendant was advised of his right to remain silent and his right to speak to an attorney before questioning. Waiving those rights, defendant failed to tell police at the first opportunity that the deceased was the aggressor and that he shot the deceased only to protect himself. The court held that a reasonable person would have informed police of these critical circumstances. Although the trial court erred in finding that the State presented testimony of two eyewitnesses when there was only one, it was not reversible error. The court found the statute to be constitutional, declining to diverge from established precedent.</SPAN></P>

The jury chose to believe the victim's trial testimony, and its conclusion was not unreasonable. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a new trial based on the victim's recanting testimony. Evidence of child sexual abuse syndrome was admissible under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115(7.2) (1989), and where the subject of the victim's recantation was first raised in the cross-examination of the victim during the state's case in chief, there was no error in the admission during the state's case in chief of evidence of the syndrome. Defendant's conduct fell within the proscription of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12(16.2)(a)(1) (1989), that statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant, and defendant had no standing to raise the constitutionality of the statute as it could apply to others. The convictions were not based upon the same physical act, and both could stand. The sentencing judge was so prejudiced by fear of HIV that he let improper factors influence him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, four members of the county board of commissioners, initiated an action against defendants to enjoin implementation of defendant president's executive order that directed the restoration of elective abortion services at a local hospital. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denied plaintiffs' petition for a preliminary injunction and dissolved the temporary restraining order that it had previously entered. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">From 1973 to 1980, elective abortions were regularly performed at a local public hospital. In 1980, the former president of the board issued a directive to the hospital's medical director ordering the immediate cessation of elective abortion services there, except those necessary to save the life of the woman. In 1992, the new defendant president issued an executive order that revoked the former president's directive. Plaintiffs contested defendant president's authority to restore elective abortion services at the hospital. The court affirmed the denial of plaintiffs' petition for a preliminary injunction, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that plaintiffs failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits. First, the board did not have a policy that prohibited defendant president from resuming the performance of elective abortions at the hospital. Second, defendant president had the delegated authority to order the resumption of such services. Plaintiffs' only recourse was to seek to override defendant president's effective veto of the former president's directive by garnering a four-fifths vote of the board members, including themselves.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with first-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder in connection with two shootings. All three defendants were tried together, convicted and sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment. On appeal, the court found no abuse of discretion and affirmed the convictions and sentences. The court ruled that the sentences were not excessive and that the record supported the trial court's opinion that consecutive sentences were necessary to protect the public pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-4(b)(1987). The court ruled that the joint trial did not prejudice defendants where the jury could reasonably be expected to compartmentalize the evidence as it related to each defendant. Also, evidence of other crimes was properly admitted to prove motive, defendants' identity and to rebut one defendant's alibi. The court ruled that one defendant waived the issue of the prosecution's misstatement of the evidence during opening remarks by failing to object.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The headless body of a homosexual man was found in his car trunk near a camping area. An eyewitness testified she saw defendant's husband hit a man on the back of the head with a baseball bat, that defendant and her husband put the man in the trunk of his car, that defendant's husband drove away in defendant's car, and that defendant followed her husband in the victim's car. Other witnesses testified regarding the extreme hatred that defendant's husband had for homosexuals. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder. The court affirmed. The indictments adequately informed defendant that she was charged with murder, and the prosecution's evidence indicated she had participated in the murder as a silent partner. Defendant admitted that she joined her husband on a spending spree with the victim's credit cards following the victim's death. Defendant had not shown any prejudice from the state's failure to prove the instrumentality of death; defendant had not relied on the state's theory of the method of murder to prepare her defense. The trial court properly sentenced her to natural life in prison rather than an extended term after considering facts in mitigation and aggravation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended he was denied a fair trial when the trial court relied on speculation and extra-evidentiary conclusions regarding the effects of PCP on the decedent. The court concluded there was a sufficient basis from which the trial court could properly infer that decedent was helpless at the time of his death. Defendant maintained the trial court's refusal to allow the medical examiner to testify about the effects of PCP on humans and the lack of other evidence to support the conclusion that defendant was defenseless, rendered its determination speculative. The court determined it could reasonably be inferred that decedent was unable to defend himself because he had consumed narcotics and alcohol. Defendant contended the evidence could have supported second degree murder. The court deemed this argument unpersuasive. The court held defendant was not denied a fair trial. Defendant argued he was denied his constitutional right to confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses against him. The court held that defendant was not denied his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, paras. 1401(a)(2)(A), 1102(h) (1989), upon which his conviction was predicated violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States and Illinois Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of unlawful delivery of more than 15 grams of cocaine. Defendant appealed. He admitted that he arranged and participated in a planned sale of cocaine, but contended that the statutes impermissibly failed to differentiate between an attempted delivery of a controlled substance and the completed act. On appeal, the court affirmed his conviction. The court determined that a rational basis existed for the legislature's decision to treat those persons caught in the act of dealing drugs the same as those persons who were caught in the act of dealing drugs but did not consummate the act. The court found that the difference between these two groups to be one without a distinction and that their equal treatment was rationally related to the legislative purpose of deterring drug trafficking and abuse. The court concluded that defendant's rights to equal protection or due process were not violated by the legislature defining the offense of delivery of a controlled substance to include an attempted delivery and penalizing both equally.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual assault under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-14(b)(1) (1989). The court affirmed his conviction. The court held that the trial court's response to the jury's note that it was hung was appropriate. An instruction to continue deliberations must be simple, neutral, and not coercive. The test of a proper instruction was whether it imposed such confusion and pressure on the jury to reach a verdict that the accuracy and integrity of the verdict became uncertain. The legislature could enact statutes governing judicial procedure without violating the separation of powers. The court's refusal to dismiss prospective jurors for cause did not prejudice defendant because he did not demonstrate that defendant was forced to accept another objectionable juror after exhausting his peremptory challenges. Evidence of defendant's similar offenses with other children was admissible to establish defendant's modus operandi. Defendant was not entitled to his requested lesser-included offense instruction because aggravated criminal sexual abuse was not a lesser-included offense of aggravated criminal sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

Evidence of similar offenses was admissible to show defendant's modus operandi. The aggravated criminal sexual abuse was not a lesser-included offense of aggravated criminal sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, Director of the Department of Insurance (Director) appealed from the order of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) granting summary judgment and a permanent injunction in favor of plaintiff pension board. The board had sought to enjoin the Director from threatening or demanding that the pension board exclude those service credits to fire fighters mandated by a previous declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues were whether a prior declaratory judgment precluded the Director from questioning the pension board's actions; whether the Director exceeded his authority in questioning the pension board's actions; and whether the injunction was improper because the dispute was not ripe, because the pension board failed to exhaust administrative remedies, and because the pension board failed to establish the necessary elements for an injunction. The court held that res judicata and collateral estoppel did not apply to preclude the Director from questioning the actions of the pension board. The Director did not order the pension board to change a policy, but sought to reverse the adjudicatory decisions themselves. Because the administrative action was beyond the authority delegated to the Director by the Pension Code, it was void. The pension board's statutory challenge was ripe for judicial review. The trial court did not fail to observe the exhaustion doctrine when it heard the request for an injunction. The pension board established a threat of irreparable harm and the lack of an adequate remedy at law, and the trial court properly issued a permanent injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the manufacturer argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by precluding it from introducing evidence that the asbestosis patients were exposed to asbestos-containing products manufactured by other companies not present at trial, and by denying its motion for change of venue. The court held: (1) evidence of exposures of the asbestosis patients to other manufacturer's products was not relevant in determining whether exposure to manufacturer's product was a substantial factor in causing their injury; (2) the manufacturer was not entitled to a change of venue under Ill. Code Civ. P., 2-1001(a)(2), Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-1001(a)(2) because the trial judge's ruling on the motion for clarification and for sanctions was a ruling on a substantive issue; (3) the evidence showed that the manufacturer was aware of the hazards of asbestos, chose not to disclose the information, and failed to place warning labels on the product at the time it knew of the hazards of the product; and (4) the manufacturer's conduct amounted to an utter indifference to or conscious disregard for the safety of others. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to warrant punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, the Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois) convicted and sentenced defendant for two counts of criminal sexual assault and one count of unlawful restraint in violation of the Criminal Code of 1961, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 12 - 13(a)(1), 10 - 3(a) (1991). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim asserted that, while lying on top of her, defendant inserted his fingers and penis into her vagina. Defendant admitted having sexual intercourse with the victim, but he claimed that it was consensual. Defendant was convicted and sentenced for two counts of criminal sexual assault and one count of unlawful restraint. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences for criminal sexual assault, holding that the victim's testimony was sufficient evidence to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. As such, defendant's ineffective assistance claim failed because the result would not have been different &quot;but for&quot; the alleged errors. Moreover, the statutory provisions defining force and consent were not unconstitutionally vague and the facts presented circumstances affording a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know the victim did not consent to have sexual relations and that he was committing sexual penetration by force. However, the court vacated defendant's unlawful restraint conviction because the act of lying on top of the victim was part of the conduct for which defendant was convicted of sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder in the beating death of a victim outside defendant's apartment. At trial, defendant alleged that he was acting in self-defense and testified that he did not receive Miranda warnings from the arresting officers or an assistant state's attorney. The trial court nevertheless convicted defendant and sentenced defendant to 35 years imprisonment. On appeal, defendant raised five points of alleged error, including the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress because the trial court improperly believed the testimony of one witness because he was a lawyer and an assistant state's attorney. The appellate court found that the trial court was entitled to disbelieve defendant's version of events in contrast to the version provided by other witnesses. The appellate court also found that, although the state's attorney did make certain improper misstatements of the law in his closing arguments, the statements did not rise to the level of prejudicial error. The appellate court, therefore, affirmed the lower court's decision regarding defendant's conviction and sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court's order of incarceration was entered in an attempt to coerce the doctor and his lawyers to accede to the administratrix's demands for information in an action brought under Ill.

The order's immediate implementation, lack of obstreperous conduct to support it, and wrong legal analysis required reversal. The circuit court decided to jail the doctor without regard to his patients. None of the jailed parties exhibited any disrespect during the proceeding. The court found that (1) rule 224 did not allow discovery as extensive as that sought and ordered, (2) the committee comments were contrary to the circuit court's construction, (3) the cases construing the rule did not support the circuit court's interpretation, (4) contrary to the circuit judge's thought, the supreme court's denial of the doctor's earlier petition for a supervisory order did not act as an approval of his management of the proceedings; and (5) the case's factual circumstances make it clear that the use of rule 224 was both unnecessary and unwarranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with sexual assault. Prior to trial, the state filed a motion in limine under the rape shield statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-7 (1989), seeking to exclude any evidence regarding the victim's sexual reputation or her prior sexual activity with anyone other than defendants. In response, one of the defendants claimed that he had watched the victim perform consensual sexual acts on a third-party on a prior occasion and that such evidence was admissible. The trial court granted the motion and subsequently found defendants guilty. Defendants appealed, claiming that the trial court erred in granting the motion in limine and that their sentences were excessive when compared to the reduced sentenced received by a third co-defendant, who pleaded guilty to lesser charges.. The court affirmed, holding (1) the evidence defendants sought to introduce was inadmissible because &quot;voyeurism&quot; did not fall within the rape shield law's definition of admissible &quot;past sexual conduct,&quot; (2) the rape shield law did not violate defendants' right of confrontation, and (3) defendants' sentences were not excessive because they and the co-defendant were not similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants arrived at an abortion facility carrying picket signs, went past the reception desk, sat on the floor of a hallway leading to the operating rooms while reading Bibles and reciting prayers, or sat on the front steps and blocked the entrance. Defendants were arrested after being informed that they were trespassing and refusing to leave the premises. The trial court granted the state's motion in limine, which barred defendants from presenting any evidence in support of the defense of necessity. The court affirmed the trial court's decision granting the motion in limine and their convictions. The court held that the defense of necessity was not a valid defense to the criminal trespass of a facility that performed abortions. The facility only performed abortions during the first trimester, which was constitutionally protected. The defense of necessity was not available to trespasses that interfered with constitutional rights. Defendants were not entitled to an instruction on necessity because the trial court found that the affirmative defense was unavailable as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that although the intervention statute was remedial and should be liberally construed, the company neglected to set forth its specific interest in the matter and how it would be affected by the amendment to the Act. The court held that the absence of specific facts in the company's complaint that established its identity and showed how it would be affected by the amendment at issue was fatal to its petition to intervene, and it held that the trial judge should have denied the company's petition to intervene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, the state challenged the decision of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which granted defendant's motions to quash his arrest and suppress evidence with respect to two separate indictments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a hearing pursuant to one indictment, the trial court held that defendant's warrantless arrest violated the Fourth Amendment, and granted his motions to quash the arrest and suppress all evidence. In the second matter, defendant's motion for an order applying collateral estoppel to his motions to quash and suppress was granted. On appeal, defendant argued that the court lacked jurisdiction to address the appeal as to the second matter because the state's notice of appeal was not timely filed. The court dismissed the appeal, concluding that the trial court's order in the second matter, though nominally an order granting collateral estoppel, was in substance and effect a suppression order which granted defendant all the relief he sought in his earlier motion to quash arrest and suppress evidence. Thus, the order was immediately appealable. The fact that the trial judge continued the cause for status was not material. Although the order stated only that the defendant's motion for collateral estoppel was granted, that statement, by the very nature of collateral estoppel, incorporated the factual findings and implicit legal conclusions of the earlier suppression order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal with respect to one case and affirmed the trial court's judgment granting defendant's motion to quash his arrest and suppress evidence in the second case.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the trial court erred in preventing an expert called by the executor in rebuttal from testifying to the standard of care for pulmonologists on the grounds that she could have presented the witness in the case in chief; where the rebuttal evidence was otherwise proper, it was not barred merely because it could have been brought in the case in chief. The court also found that the trial court did not err in allowing the doctor the deceased was scheduled to see the day after he died to testify as an expert for the defendants because the doctor never saw the deceased, had not reviewed the deceased's medical records, and no doctor-patient relationship existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Macon County (Illinois), which accepted his guilty plea for aggravated sexual assault, sentenced him to 11 years in prison, and then ordered him to pay the cost of the proceedings. Defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court denied him procedural due process by entering a money judgment for costs without notice following his guilty plea. He further argued that the judgment improperly modified the plea agreement reached with the state. The court disagreed and affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 180-3 (1991) stated that when any person was convicted of an offense under any statute, or at common law, the court had to enter judgment that the offender pay the costs of the prosecution. The court held that defendant's notice of the requirement that the trial court impose costs on his conviction was premised upon the doctrine of law that one was presumed to know the law and ignorance of it was no excuse. The court held that the trial court was not responsible for advising defendant of the civil or collateral consequences of his guilty plea. The court held that the trial judge did not modify the plea agreement merely by inserting the condition that defendant pay the court costs because the trial judge was not only authorized, but was required to have defendant pay the court costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea after he was ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendant, a competitor of plaintiff, seeking to enjoin defendant from maintaining advertising signs on grounds that the signs violated applicable provisions of the Municipal Code of the City of Chicago, a home rule unit. Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the language of the Illinois Municipal Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 24, para. 11-13-1, rendered Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 24, para. 11-13-15 inapplicable to alleged violations of a City of Chicago ordinance, and plaintiff therefore lacked standing to bring the action. The trial judge denied defendant's motion and certified the issue on appeal. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Section 11-13-1 was applicable, in the main, to home rule and non-home rule municipalities. The court found that plaintiff had standing to maintain the action. The court did not believe that the 1971 amendment restricted the power of home rule communities, rather it enhanced their right to decide their own destiny.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowner owned a seven-bedroom house, which was located in an area zoned for single-family residences, in the town and rented the house to students. The rent generated an income of approximately $ 16,000 a year. He also rented the house during the summer for approximately $ 1,000 to $ 1,200. The Zoning Board of Appeals sustained the determination made by the building commissioner that the town's zoning code required the homeowner to change the lawful nonconforming use of his property from a rooming house to a single-family residence. The lower court upheld the board's ruling and the homeowner sought further review, arguing that the board's interpretation of the zoning code was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence and that the applicable nonconforming-use provisions of the code were void for vagueness. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that prohibiting certain types of repair or extensive repair on structures devoted to a nonconforming use was a reasonable method for eliminating such nonconforming uses over time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Circuit Court of McHenry County (Illinois) for unlawful delivery of a controlled substance and criminal drug conspiracy. He argued that the trial court erred in entering convictions of the inchoate offenses and substance ones, and that &sect;&sect; 401(a)(7), 401(b)(7) of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, paras. 1401(a)(7), (b)(7) (1989), violated equal protection and due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that defendant waived the issue of improper sentencing when he failed to raise it either in his motion to vacate the guilty plea or in his motion to reconsider his sentence. However, under the plain error doctrine, the trial court vacated defendant's convictions and sentences for criminal drug conspiracy. The court affirmed the other conviction. The reversal of one conviction did not require that defendant be resentenced on the remaining conviction, as long as the trial court considered the offenses separately and sentenced defendant separately on each offense. Defendant had standing to challenge both sections of the statute since they equated grams of LSD with objects containing LSD. There was a rational basis for the State's choice of penalties for LSD distribution in that it intended to punish severely large-volume drug traffickers at any level. The equal protection clause did not deny the States the power to classify in their exercise of their police power and it gave broad latitude in classifying. Defendant did not dispute the number of objects containing LSD, indicating that the police had no difficulty in applying it, and the statute was not vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's conviction for criminal drug conspiracy and affirmed his conviction for unlawful delivery of a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant fast-food company challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff corporate officers in their breach of contract action. The officers filed a cross-appeal relating to their interest award and to the denial of their claim for attorney fees. The officers also challenged a ruling that dismissed defendants, detective agencies and individuals, from the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officers claimed that the fast-food company violated a written settlement agreement in a subsequent bankruptcy court proceeding by encouraging its rejection in favor of a different settlement. The fast-food company argued that its conduct was justified by its &quot;duty&quot; to disclose the parties' earlier settlement negotiations to the bankruptcy court. The court affirmed the trial court's award of summary judgment in favor of the officers. The court held that the fast-food company breached the agreement where nothing on its face was ambiguous regarding the parties' intention to settle the officers' claims. The court found that the breach of contract could not be justified by references to ethics and public policy. The court rejected the fast-food company's argument that its breach was excused because the bankruptcy court's approval of the settlement agreement would not have been forthcoming in any event. The court held that the officers were not entitled to attorney fees based on the fast-food company's bad faith. The court concluded that the detective agencies and individuals were included in the scope of the settlement agreement and thus were properly dismissed from the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in all respects, including the determination of liability on the part of the fast-food company, the amount of damages, the amount of prejudgment interest, and the refusal to award attorney fees to the officers. The court also affirmed the trial court's order that dismissed the detective agencies and individuals from the case.</SPAN></P>

No Democratic candidate ran and none was nominated by petition. Following the primary, the Democratic party nominated appellees as candidates by party resolution. Objections were filed to the Democratic nominees' placement on the general election ballot. They claimed that the nomination was unconstitutional because Ill. Const. art.

It held that the trial court had original jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of a statute. The framers believed that the primary election of judicial candidates would be conducted in the same manner as primary elections for governor, implicitly including the right of political parties to fill vacancies in nomination for judicial office by resolution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of aggravated arson and sentenced him to 12 years imprisonment following a jury trial, he appealed. The court affirmed. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury's verdict. The evidence was sufficient to satisfy the definition of a burning. The court agreed with the trial court's finding that no rational basis existed upon which the jury could find defendant guilty of any of the lesser offenses instead of the greater offense of aggravated arson. The evidence establishing the presence of people in the building precluded the giving of an instruction on simple arson. The record was devoid of evidence tending to show that defendant acted recklessly. The trial court correctly refused to instruct the jury on a statute addressing criminal damage to property. Defendant failed to establish a constitutional infirmity in the aggravated arson statute as written or in its application to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient filed a malpractice action against defendant hospital based in part on the acts of a psychiatric resident who treated the patient at the hospital and issued a pass authorizing the patient to leave the hospital. The patient brought an interlocutory appeal from an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) permitting the hospital's attorneys to have private discussions with the psychiatric resident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was severely injured after leaving the hospital on the pass issued by the psychiatric resident. On appeal, the court held that the interlocutory order permitting the hospital to conduct an ex parte interview with the resident was reviewable under the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Confidentiality Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91 1/2, para. 801 et seq. (1991), and Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 307(a)(1), 134 Ill. 2d R. 307(a)(1), which did not conflict with each other, because the patient's privilege could not be effectively restored on review from the final judgment after trial and she could not be obtain immediate review by being found in contempt of the order. The court further held that the order was improper because &sect; 10 of the Act established the hospital's undisputed right to discovery of information from the resident through appropriate court-supervised discovery channels, but provided no support for a special right to a private interview with the resident. The trial court could only decline to review the information in camera if it provided some other means of protecting the patient's right to limit disclosure of potentially damaging matters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order permitting the hospital to conduct a private interview with the psychiatric resident and remanded for court-supervised formal discovery.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the state's petition to sentence defendant pursuant to the Illinois Habitual Criminal Act (Act) was unverified in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33B-2(a) (1989), but that defendant waived the error. The court ruled that the state was required to prove defendant's prior felonies beyond a reasonable doubt, but that defendant waived his objection by failing to raise the issue at the sentencing hearing. The court determined that defendant was not penalized for exercising his right to stand trial because the state was permitted to recommend a greater sentence than the reduced sentence offered in a plea agreement.</SPAN></P>

After the agreement was terminated, the parties continued to negotiate over terms, price, and internal wiring of the system; they could not reach an agreement. The homeowner associations took actions that positively discouraged any relationship with the cable company. The cable company filed a complaint. The circuit court issued a preliminary injunction that enjoined the homeowner associations from interfering with the cable company's servicing of its existing customers and equipment, with the cable company's marketing or promotional activities, or with installation for two named residents and required notice before any installation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital was granted a property tax exemption as a charitable organization pursuant to the Revenue Act of 1939, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 500.7 (1989). The hospital operated a not-for-profit child care center on a contiguous parcel of property. The department found that the primary use of the child care's property was neither charitable nor educational and denied the hospital's application for tax exemption. The child care center was not profitable and provided a service to the employees of the hospital. The hospital contended that the child care center was reasonably necessary to fulfill the charitable objections of the hospital. The court held that property of charitable institutions qualified for a charitable exemption if the use of the property was exclusively charitable or reasonably necessary for accomplishing the goals of a charitable organization. The record in the instant case indicated that the area had a shortage of child care facilities and that the employees had difficulty finding child care that fit the hospital scheduling requirements. The child care center enabled the hospital to retain quality employees to better serve the needs of the community.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teachers, who were employees of a cooperative vocational education program under the Board's control, were dismissed due to a reduction in force, even though they had tenure. The teachers contended that they, like special education teachers, had &quot;super-tenure&quot; rights under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 24-11 (1991) in the school districts participating in the joint education program. The court rejected the argument that the statute granted the same tenure protections to teachers in all types of joint educational agreements. All joint agreements were not subsets of special education joint agreements. Special education joint agreements were species of joint agreements. The statute provided for &quot;super-tenure&quot; only for special education teachers. The legislature intended to treat special education teachers differently from other joint program teachers. The distinction between special education teachers and other classes of teachers in relation to tenure rights did not violate equal protection guarantees because the classification rationally advanced the objective of attracting and retaining professionals with highly particularized training and experience.</SPAN></P>

The mother alleged that the police officers refused to break down the apartment door even after she informed them that the assailant was inside with her children.

The court found that (1) the mother failed to establish that a special duty was owed by the municipalities and police officers based on facts showing that her children were injured while they were under the direct and immediate control of the police officers. (2) The mother's claim of gender-based discrimination was not supported by any established municipal policy nor by the questions asked by one police officer, who may have been attempting to determine if there was a domestic dispute in order to decide how to proceed. (3) The police officers' actions in initially not entering the apartment and in removing the mother from the area did not establish the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress because the police officers were likely acting to protect the mother and not with an intent to inflict her with emotional distress.</SPAN></P>

The victim's claim that defendant was the perpetrator was in direct conflict with alibi evidence presented by defendant through which defendant claimed to have been at work all day. The trial court convicted defendant based largely on the victim's identification and, on appeal, the court affirmed because the court found the victim credible and held that the jury was free to disbelieve defendant's alibi defense. The court reviewed the banishment condition of defendant's probation and reversed that condition as overly broad. The court found the banishment condition served no valid purpose and the record did not reveal any justifiable basis for imposing such a broad condition. That condition alone was reversed and the matter was remanded for reconsideration of probation conditions.</SPAN></P>

Upon reconsideration of the issue, the court held that the trial court properly sentenced defendant for possession with intent to deliver 900 grams or more of a controlled substance. In pertinent part, the court noted that it was undisputed that defendant's sentence was at the low end of the statutory range of sentencing for the offense. Thus, given the seriousness of the offense, the nature and circumstances of the case, and defendant's criminal history, the court could not say that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing defendant. Lastly, the court held that defendant's argument that he was a first-time offender was irrelevant under the statutory scheme, and that Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois), which convicted defendant of first-degree murder under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(a)(1)(1989) and attempted murder under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 8-4(a)(1989). Defendant also challenged the imposition of a 20-year term of incarceration for murder, followed by a 10-year consecutive sentence for attempted murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed her boyfriend and attempted to kill the woman that he was caught having sex with. On appeal, defendant argued that (1) the trial judge tendered incorrect instructions on a special verdict of guilty but mentally ill, (2) the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing her to consecutive terms of imprisonment, and (3) the statutory scheme for first-degree and second-degree murder was unconstitutional. The court affirmed, modified, and vacated the judgment in part, and remanded the case. The court modified the judgment to reflect a guilty but mentally ill verdict to remove any prejudice that resulted from defense counsel's failure to tender proper instructions and ruled that a new sentencing hearing was needed. The court further determined that the consecutive sentences were proper because there was evidence to support the trial court's finding that the attempted murder of the woman was motivated by a criminal objective that differed from the motivation to murder the man. However, the court did comment on what sentence should be imposed upon remand. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the statutes were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed in part, modified in part, vacated in part, and remanded. The judgments that defendant was guilty of murder and of attempted murder were vacated. The judgments that defendant was guilty of murder but mentally ill and of attempted murder but mentally ill were entered. In addition, the case was remanded for resentencing on both of the modified convictions.</SPAN></P>

The court, in affirming, held that trial counsel had not improperly conceded defendant's guilt of second-degree murder, inasmuch as that was a reasonable strategy given the number of eyewitnesses to defendant's act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mayor and the city filed an action seeking judicial review of the commission's decision reversing the mayor's refusal, in his capacity as the local liquor control commissioner, of the bars' requests for retail liquor licenses. The trial court dismissed the action, holding that the mayor and city did not have standing to seek administrative review. The court reversed, finding that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 43, para. 154a (1991), which amended the Illinois Liquor Control Act to give the mayor standing to seek judicial review, applied retroactively although the law was changed after the complaint was filed but before final judgment of the circuit court was entered. The amendment was a reaction to overturn an erroneous judicial decision and clarified the existing statute to state that appeals from the local appeal commission were to be considered procedurally equivalent to those from the state commission. Retroactive application of the amended statute was the just and equitable result because, prior to the erroneous judicial decision, local liquor commissioners had successfully brought similar actions. The court remanded with directions to proceed with judicial review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim testified that defendant beat and raped her. Defendant questioned whether the aggravated criminal sexual assault statute was unconstitutional, whether the jury was improperly instructed, and whether his sentence was excessive. The court rejected defendant's contention that the statute was unconstitutional because the mental state of intent, knowledge, or recklessness was implied. Moreover, defendant waived any objections to jury instructions because defendant neither objected to the jury instructions given nor tendered alternate instructions. Defendant's motion for a new trial did not address improprieties in the jury instructions. However, the instruction on aggravated kidnapping omitted an essential element of the crime, but such error was harmless. Further, a trial judge's decision on sentencing was entitled to great weight and would not be disturbed absent a showing of an abuse of judicial discretion. Considering the sentencing hearing as a whole, the court found no abuse of discretion in sentencing defendant to an extended term of 55 years. The court, therefore, affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the order was outside of the authority of the juvenile court, that an improper standard was applied, and that the evidence was insufficient to justify the DNR order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A minor infant was born several weeks prematurely, suffering from severe cocaine withdrawal and infection with the human immunodeficiency virus. Due to the infant's condition, and her 19-year-old parents' inability to care for her, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) petitioned to make the infant a ward of the court. Appellee DCFS guardianship administrator was appointed guardian and appellant guardian ad litem was appointed. Upon the request of the parents, appellee guardian petitioned the juvenile court for authority to consent to the entry of a &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; (DNR) order on the infant's medical charts. After a hearing, the juvenile court granted the petition. The order was stayed pending appellant's review. In affirming the decision, the court held that the juvenile court had jurisdiction to hear the case and to grant appellee permission to enter the DNR order. The court ruled that, because the consent or desire of the infant could not be determined, the juvenile court properly applied a best interests of the minor standard of review. The court found that the medical evidence was clear, convincing, and supported the decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant doctor appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which denied the doctor's motion to reduce a general jury verdict in a medical malpractice case, where a judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff patient, by an amount equal to 50 percent of collateral source payments for medical expenses and lost wages as provided for by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-1205(2) (1983).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the circumstances presented by the record on appeal, the court held that the mere fact that the verdict was a general one, did not preclude its reduction. The court held that the itemization of a verdict so as to reflect the monetary distribution between economic loss and noneconomic loss was mandatory and the refusal of such a tendered instruction was reversible error. However, no such itemized verdict form was either tendered or refused by the parties. As a result, the court held that, inasmuch as it was the court's duty to review a trial court's judgment and not its reasons therefore, and, assuming arguendo that the jury's verdict did include recovery for the patient's medical expenses and lost wages, the court nonetheless affirmed the trial court's refusal to reduce the judgment on the basis that the doctor failed to prove the reduction to which he was entitled. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that the trial court's judgment was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The development company filed complaints for condemnation of two parcels owned by the property owner. The circuit court's order gave the development company the authority to exercise the right of eminent domain, awarded compensation, and vested the fee simple titles and the temporary easements in the development company. The property owner appealed, alleging that the two parcels were not properly subject to the eminent domain proceedings, and that his constitutional rights were violated in that he had not been given proper notice. On appeal, the court affirmed, in part, the circuit court's denial of the property owner's motion to set aside, and dismissed the appeal relating to the constitutional violation. The court held that the property owner's interlocutory appeal was limited to the three issues set forth &sect;7-104(b) of the Act. The court found that because the property owner's appeal was broader than permitted, the appeal relating to the constitutionality of the Act's provisions had to be dismissed. The court held that although the property owner perfected his appeal on the three statutory issues, his lack of argument on those issues constituted a waiver of those issues.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the circuit court properly concluded that the candidate's petition was not moot because the incumbent was never unequivocally declared the winner. The court further held that the candidate's petition was not barred by laches because there was no showing that she lacked diligence in asserting her claim. The court found that circuit court did not err in refusing to count the ballots that were not initialed because the court was unwilling to carve out an exception to the initialing requirement set out in Ill.

The court held that the director raised a valid affirmative defense that the motorist failed to file her action within the time limits of &sect; 8-101 and was entitled to a directed verdict. The court held that &sect; 8-101 applied because the director was acting within the scope of his employment when the accident occurred and the motorist's action was subject to the limitations period under the Act. The director was on-call 24 hours a day, was driving a village vehicle, and was engaged in his usual routine of work duties when the collision happened.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a bookstore that sold adult magazines and videos, was convicted for two counts of obscenity after 26 magazines and 5 videotapes were seized during a search of defendant's premises. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the conviction. The court held that the state's decision to charge all the magazines as one count and all the videos as the second count, along with the trial court's decision to submit general, rather than special, verdict forms as to each count, created an impermissible prior restraint. The court found that defendant could not determine which of the magazines or videos were in fact obscene given that the jury was only required to find that at least one was obscene to convict defendant. This uncertainty rendered the procedures unconstitutional. Additionally, the court held that the trial court erred when it included a challenged portion of a pattern jury instruction regarding obscenity as viewed with reference to children without first making a finding that some evidence existed from which the jury might find that the material was specially designed for or directed to an audience of children.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 314a26 et seq. (1953) and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens' complaint alleged that the Authority had failed to fix and adjust tolls at the lowest possible rate, thereby unlawfully accumulating and withholding a surplus fund of $ 74 million (count I); that the Authority had wrongfully diverted and misappropriated the Northern Illinois Toll Highway surplus to pay construction costs on a new and separate tollway (count II); and had violated their civil rights under &sect; 1983 (count VI). The trial court dismissed counts I, II, and VI of the amended complaint. The court affirmed. With respect to count I, the citizens had failed to demonstrate with particularity the method in which the surplus funds had been wrongfully diverted or misappropriated, or any unlawful action by the Authority. With respect to Count II, the legislature had intended that tolls and revenues collected from the existing highway system be applied to construction and land acquisition costs for the challenged toll highway. Given the court's affirmation of the trial court's dismissal of counts I and II, count VI, which was premised upon a right of property from which due process had been wrongfully denied, necessarily had to fall.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a class action, plaintiffs, investment company and those similarly situated, appealed the dismissal of its complaint against defendants, county, treasurer, and clerk, by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), claiming that the voluntary payment doctrine did not apply, that they had standing to challenge the state Revenue Act's constitutionality, and that the challenged statute violated their due process and equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court dismissed a complaint against defendants, county, treasurer, and clerk, that challenged the constitutionality of the state Revenue Act (Act), plaintiff investment company appealed. The court affirmed the judgment below, ruling that because plaintiff was not a party at the scavenger sale confirmation proceeding, the complaint was not an impermissible collateral attack. When the bidder-taxpayer became owner of a certificate of purchase after confirmation of a sale and petition for a tax deed, he became a party. Until then, defendant treasurer was the party in the proceedings. The court also held that because plaintiff paid a fee in the scavenger sale process, he had standing to challenge the statutory scheme related to the fee proceeds. The court ruled, however, that the Act was constitutional. A strong presumption of constitutionality accompanied a state's scheme of taxation which was overcome only by a clear showing that it was arbitrary and provided an unreasonable classification, and plaintiff did not overcome that presumption. The transfer of money accumulated in one fund into a general revenue fund was within the legislature's authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment below that dismissed plaintiff investment company's complaint against defendants, county, treasurer, and clerk, although the complaint was not a collateral attack on a previous proceeding nor barred by the voluntary payment doctrine and plaintiff had standing, the Revenue Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A patient's complaint against a doctor and hospital for negligently causing her to contract tuberculosis was dismissed by the lower court. On appeal, the patient claimed that the medical report requirements of Ill. Code Civ. P., 110 Ill. Comp. Stat. 2-622 were unconstitutional, and that the trial court erred in refusing to grant her discovery of certain medical records, in refusing leave to submit an amended medical report, and in holding that one of the counts sounded in malpractice rather than ordinary negligence. The court held summarily that the medical report requirements were constitutional. The court held further that (1) the patient failed to support her argument that the lower court erred in refusing to allow her to discover certain medical records with any authority, (2) where the patient failed to tender proposed amendments that might cure her failure to comply with the medical report requirements, the lower court did not abuse its discretion in refusing leave to amend the report, and (3) where the standard of care in preventing the spread of infectious diseases in a hospital was not simply a matter of lay knowledge, the patient's cause of action sounded in malpractice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted based on his attempts to lure a 14-year-old girl into his truck while she was walking home from school. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court rejected defendant's argument that the child abduction statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 10-5(b)(10) (1987), created an unconstitutional mandatory presumption by presuming unlawful intent upon proof of the statute's other elements. The court held that para. 10-5(b)(10) instead created a permissive inference, because proof of the other elements merely constituted prima facie evidence of unlawful intent, and the statute placed no restraint on the trier of fact's ability to accept or reject that inference. The court held that the trial court properly found unlawful intent on defendant's part where the inference was supported by corroborating evidence of his guilt. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a continuance for defendant to obtain an evaluation of his sanity, because the case had been pending for a long time and defendant had been competently represented by counsel. The court also rejected defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 110, para. 8-201 (1989). The court held that the trial court correctly refused to apply comparative negligence or grant a directed verdict on contributory negligence and noted that wrongful death claimants who contributed to the death of another were different than common law tort victims and not entitled to recover benefit for their wrongdoing. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the husband's negligence contributed to his wife's death. The court held that the Dead Man's Act was not violated because the husband had opened the door to the physician's testimony on his communications with the wife.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voter filed a complaint alleging that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 103-7 (1989) constituted special legislation in violation of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 and constituted an impermissible delegation of legislative authority to an administrative board in violation of Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. The circuit court granted the state board of elections' motion to dismiss the voter's complaint. The voter appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that there was at least one rational basis for Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 103-7 (1989), that there was no reason why the legislature had to change every community college district at once as it sought to remedy the &quot;evil&quot; of at-large elections, and that the court was to defer to the discretion of the Illinois General Assembly where it saw fit to designate an administrative board as the appropriate body to determine electoral boundaries for the community college district's new single-member electoral districts. It was conceivable that the legislature sought to remedy the &quot;evil&quot; of at-large election districts in order to avoid requiring the district to litigate the appropriateness of such electoral districts in federal court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the decedent was 65 percent negligent. The court allowed the transit authority to supplement the record on appeal because the decedent's representative would not have been prejudiced. The court noted that there was testimony that the bus accelerated while the rear doors were open, which would not have occurred if the interlock system had been functioning properly, and the jury was free to find in favor of either side. The court held that the decedent's contributory negligence did not preclude the representative from prevailing on res ipsa loquitur claims. While the finding of 65 percent contributory negligence appeared to be inconsistent with the rationale behind the element of control, the analysis focused on whether the transit authority's inferred negligence was, more probably than not, a cause of the injury, though the decedent's negligent acts might also have contributed to his death. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the representative's expert to testify. The court held that the trial court was correct in declining to award prejudgment interest under the Illinois Wrongful Death Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 70, para. 1 et seq.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois) entered a default judgment against the company for its noncompliance with a court order to produce two of its employees as witnesses at trial. The company appealed the judgment entered against it and the order denying its motion for post-trial relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was ordered to produce two of its employees who lived outside of the jurisdiction of the court to be witnesses at trial.

The court held that as long as the order was directed at the corporate defendant rather than the individual employees, the principles of due process were not violated, and the court could sanction the company for its failure to produce its employees. The court held that the imposition of sanctions under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 219(c), 134 Ill. 2d R. 219(c), was a matter within the discretion of the trial court, and a reviewing court would uphold the trial court's decision, absent an abuse of discretion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois), whose jury convicted defendant of criminal fortification of a residence, unlawful use of a weapon by a felon, possession of a firearm without an owner's identification card, possession of cocaine, possession of cannabis, and possession of a hypodermic needle or syringe. He was sentenced accordingly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first challenged the criminal fortification of a residence conviction under 38 Ill. Comp. Stat. 19/5 (1989). He argued that the statute was vague and that it should not apply to small habitual drug users. Under a search warrant, the police broke down the door to defendant's residence. The door was barricaded by a board and had four deadlocks. The court held that defendant did not meet his burden of clearly establishing the statute's constitutional infirmity. The criminal fortification statute was reasonably designed to promote entry of police into areas used for illegal drug activity, which was a threat to public welfare. The statute was a reasonable exercise of the state's police power, and thus defendant suffered no deprivation of due process. There was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that defendant intended to prevent the officers from entering his residence because of the illegal drugs use. Defendant clearly maintained his residence in a fortified condition. Defendant also challenged his conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon under 38 Ill. Comp. Stat. 24/1.1 (1989). The evidence established that defendant constructively possessed a pistol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences. The court held that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes of criminal fortification of a residence and of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 439.1 et seq. The department cross-appealed the trial court's refusal to impose a municipal use tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department assessed use taxes on the Michigan corporation's jet, which it bought in Georgia, registered in Michigan, and kept in a hangar in Illinois. The corporation's headquarters were located in an Illinois village, and it had manufacturing and distribution facilities in numerous states and foreign countries. The court affirmed the judgment and held that: (1) the trial court properly applied the Complete Auto four-part test to determine that the jet should be taxed because current Commerce Clause principles applied where the Act was neither ambiguous nor unclear; (2) the Act's exemption for interstate carriers for hire met the requirements of uniformity because real and substantial differences existed between those who were taxed and those who were not and the classification was reasonably related to a legislative purpose; (3) the jet had to be registered in Illinois because the corporation was an Illinois resident for the purposes of the Illinois Aeronautic Act and the jet did not qualify for the commercial flying exemption; and (4) the jet was not subject to the village's municipal use tax because the jet was used where passengers boarded it, not at the corporate offices.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed a petition for entry of a child support order against the father. The trial court entered an order requiring the father to pay $ 30 in current support and directing any payor of the defendant to withhold $ 30 per week for current child support, but refused the state's request to include an amount to be withheld toward a potential delinquency because no delinquency existed at the time of the order. On appeal, the court reversed and ruled that &sect; 20 of the Illinois Parentage Act of 1984, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 2501 et seq. (1989), imposed a mandatory requirement that all orders of support designate a specific additional amount to be withheld in the event of a delinquency. The court also ruled that this statutory requirement was not an unconstitutional legislative encroachment upon the judiciary. The court noted that, in enacting the statute, the legislature complied with a federal mandate and that 45 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 303.100(a)(4), (b)(1) (1986) required that the procedure for income withholding be triggered when the absent parent failed to make payment for one month's support and that the withholding must occur without the need for any further action by the court.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court reversed and found that the permit application allowed the board access to the manhole and the board was not denied access thereto. On appeal, the board argued that the inspections were a condition of the permit. The court agreed and reversed. The board was given statutory authority to condition or prohibit the discharge of industrial wastewater. The court found nothing in the law that granted the company a vested right to continuous discharge in the POTW on its own terms and conditions. Thus, while the company was free to refuse the board access to its facilities, it did so at the risk of having the board revoke its permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision and reinstated the board's order.</SPAN></P>

The guests included an individual later involved in an altercation with defendant, the victim, and three others. After the individual arrived at the party, he and defendant became involved in a fight regarding the girlfriend. The individual left the party, but quickly returned when he heard the girlfriend scream for help. The individual saw defendant beating her. When he tried to help, defendant stabbed him with a knife, and the individual again left. Subsequently, defendant fatally stabbed the victim while he was in the second floor bedroom. The victim's knife wounds indicated that he was stabbed from behind. At the trial, defendant's expert witness testified that he was mildly to moderately mentally retarded. The trial court found him guilty of first degree murder. The court affirmed the judgment, holding defendant was not entitled to a reduction of conviction to second degree murder because he did not act under a sudden and intense passion that resulted from serious provocation, considering his passion was directed to the victim, an innocent bystander, and the individual had already fled the premises.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant was not convicted under a statute that the marriage exception applied to, so he could not benefit from it being found unconstitutional and that he was not similarly situated to the three classes of offenders that the exception applied to for U.S. Const. amend. XIV purposes. The court also held that the exclusion of evidence of the victim's mental health records did not violate defendant's due process rights, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by barring defendant from cross-examining the victim as to her hospitalization or diagnosis because defendant failed to make any showing of how the examination would be relevant to her credibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit judge sought appointment to a vacancy on the appellate court. As part of the application process, the association evaluated the circuit judge's qualifications and rated her as &quot;not recommended&quot; for the office. The circuit judge brought an action alleging that she was denied due process. The trial court dismissed her complaint. More than 10 months after it was due, the circuit judge filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. The trial court denied the circuit judge's motion as untimely. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion because the authority of the trial court to dismiss the action due to failure to abide by orders was necessary to prevent undue delays in the disposition of pending cases. In order to state a cause of action under the Fourteenth Amendment, the association's actions had to be those of a state actor, not merely those of a private association. The circuit judge had no protected liberty interest in obtaining a single position as an appellate judge where other opportunities existed, and the &quot;not recommended&quot; rating did not significantly injure her professional standing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village filed complaints charging the car wash with violating the village's Sunday closing ordinance. The trial court entered an order granting the car wash's motion to dismiss the complaints on the basis that the ordinance by its express language exempted the washing of motor vehicles from its proscriptions. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the ordinance did not create an exemption. It was apparent that there was a typographical error in the printing of the ordinance. To accept the typographical error required the court to assume that the village, in enacting the ordinance and its amendments, abandoned any effort to maintain internal cohesion and grammatical integrity. The court thus construed the ordinance in accord with the clear intent of the village. However, the court was unable to say with certainty that the car wash had prior knowledge that the village did not intend to provide an exemption for the washing of motor vehicles. Therefore, the trial court on remand could have considered the issue of notice.</SPAN></P>

They did not name a second city attorney until they filed their second amended complaint, which was more than two years after the arrest.

The court held that the circuit court properly entered summary judgment on the remaining counts because the officers had probable cause to make an arrest and to shut down the show.

The court rejected defendant's contention that his right to effective assistance of counsel was violated because both prongs of the Strickland test were satisfied. First, defense counsel's overall performance was competent and defendant consented to his attorney's legitimate, although impracticable independent crime theory as a defense for murder. Moreover, defense counsel did not concede any fact to which defendant did not admit to the police. Second, defendant was not prejudiced by counsel's performance because the evidence of guilt was overwhelming. The court rejected defendant's contention that the record did not show that he intelligently and knowingly agreed to plead guilty because the recorded proved that he pleaded not guilty. As for defendant's extended term sentence, the court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3.2(b)(2) (1985) was not unconstitutionally vague because it specifically described the conduct that qualified for an extended-term sentence.

Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 1004(q) (1991), was unconstitutional, and that the state EPA had acted beyond its statutory authority because contamination was found on only 12 acres of the corporation's approximately 64-acre parcel and the notice related to the entire parcel. The trial court dismissed the action because the corporation failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and refused to review the action by writ of certiorari. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that the lack of a preenforcement proceeding did not offend due process, and that preenforcement judicial review was not available under the Act. However, the court held that the gross disparity between the area of alleged actual contamination and the area included in the notice presented a case appropriate for review under common law certiorari and that the trial court's failure to grant such review was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-19(a), 1991, the definition of &quot;abuse&quot; did not require that the victim have an actual, visible physical injury and defendant's guilt of the offense was proved beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) the charge of abuse was not insufficient due to certain elements of the offense not being supplied in the indictment because the elements missing from that count were supplied by another count; (3) defendant waived the issue of duplicity because she failed to raise it until after the court found her guilty of the abuse of two residents; and (4) Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-19 was not unconstitutionally vague because defendant could reasonably have been expected to understand that the statute proscribed the conduct in which she engaged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of St. Clair County (Illinois), which sentenced him to imprisonment under the sentencing provisions of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3(c)(2)(C) (1989), from a judgment of guilty but mentally ill on a charge of aggravated criminal sexual assault, a Class X felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mentally retarded defendant was found guilty but mentally ill of aggravated criminal sexual assault. The trial court held that he was eligible for probation but that the mandatory sentencing provisions precluded probation. Defendant was sentenced to prison for six years after a determination that he did not fit the criteria for civil commitment. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction but vacated the sentence and remanded the case for a new sentencing hearing. The court held that the offense's mandatory prison provisions could yield to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 104-26(c)(1) (1989), because the legislature intended that special provisions be made for unfit defendants and gave the trial court sentencing discretion under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3(c)(2)(C) (1989). Because punishment should be directly related to the personal culpability of defendant and because the legislature adopted a &quot;least restrictive alternative&quot; approach to sentencing in which probation was the preferred disposition of all offenses for which it was authorized, the court concluded that the trial court erred in ruling that it had no discretion to sentence defendant to probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant mortgagors challenged the decision of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Illinois), which denied their motion to have the circuit court's prior order that confirmed the foreclosure sale set aside on the grounds that the terms of the sale were not fair and that justice was not done by the sale. Plaintiff mortgagee had instituted the action to foreclose on two mortgages it had issued to the mortgagors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On November 17, 1989, the circuit court entered a judgment of foreclosure that specified that the redemption period was governed by &sect; 15-1603(b)(1) of the Illinois Mortgage Foreclosure Law, codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 15-1603(b)(1) (1989). The circuit court made an express written finding pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 304(a), codified at 134 Ill. 2d R. 304(a), that there was no just reason for delaying enforcement or appeal. The court found that the redemption period was set by the November 17, 1989 judgment, which expressly indicated that the redemption period was based on &sect; 15-1603(b)(1). The circuit court's judgment contained the express finding required by Rule 304(a) and, thus, it was a final and appealable order.If the mortgagors believed that the use of &sect; 15-1603(b)(1) was improper, that was when the issue should have been raised. Yet, they did not file a timely notice of appeal from that judgment. The mortgagors were foreclosed from directly attacking the circuit court's decision regarding the applicable redemption period. The court dismissed the appeal because the mortgagors advanced no cognizable basis for a collateral attack on the circuit court's ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's decision, which denied the mortgagors' motion to have the circuit court's prior order that confirmed the foreclosure sale set aside on the grounds that the terms of the sale were not fair and that justice was not done by the sale.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the patient's representative had failed to comply with the requirement of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-622 (1989) and dismissed the case against the doctor with prejudice. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the patient's representative waived certain arguments about the sufficiency of the medical reports she filed but, under the circumstances, the trial court abused its discretion because involuntary dismissal with prejudice did not serve the purpose of the statute, which was to deter frivolous medical malpractice suits at an early stage. In so holding, the court noted that nothing in the record indicated that this was a frivolous claim or that the doctor would be unduly prejudiced by allowing the patient's representative to amend her complaint.</SPAN></P>

Later that morning, a police officer stopped defendant for having committed several traffic violations. A computer check showed that the vehicle was registered to the owner. Defendant later told four different stories as to how he came into possession of the car. During his conversion trial, the state filed an amended complaint and defendant's counsel did not object. He was then convicted of unlawful possession of a stolen vehicle. The court affirmed the conviction, by holding that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant's actions constituted a conversion of the car because there was no evidence that he intended to return it to the owner. The court also held that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel because his counsel sufficiently argued the law of conversion as it appeared in the amended complaint.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the court found that the prior consistent statements were not admissible.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff decedent's estate appealed an order of the Circuit Court of the 9th Judicial Circuit, McDonough County, Illinois, dismissing its wrongful death action. Plaintiff alleged that defendants, members of a university club, were involved in &quot;hazing&quot; decedent, pressuring him to drink, and causing his intoxication, from which he died.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff decedent's estate alleged that defendants, members of a university club, were involved in &quot;hazing&quot; decedent, causing his intoxication and eventual death. Plaintiff also alleged that one defendant, in whose dormitory room decedent died, breached a voluntarily assumed duty to care for him. Decedent was a &quot;rookie&quot; in a club in which membership was a valued status. The complaint alleged that the initiation violated the Hazing Act (Act), Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 144, para. 220.9 et seq. (Supp. 1990). The trial court dismissed for failure to plead that drinking was required for initiation, and failure to adequately allege that one defendant assumed a duty. The court reversed, holding it was sufficient to have pled that the club had a de facto drinking requirement. Under the Act, defendants owed decedent a duty to act reasonably to protect him, and it was reasonably foreseeable that injury could have resulted. The court rejected arguments that the Act was unconstitutional and that the cause of action did not apply to individual club members. The court also held that the complaint adequately stated a claim that one defendant negligently breached an assumed duty of care.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dismissal and remanded the cause of action for further proceedings. The court held that the complaint adequately stated a cause of action against defendants, members of a university club, for wrongful death and against one defendant for breach of an assumed duty to care for decedent. The court held that the allegation of a de facto drinking requirement was sufficient to plead a cause of action under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another individual entered a woman's car and robbed her. Defendant filed a motion for a mistrial on the basis that the prosecution improperly used peremptory challenges to exclude three blacks from the jury. The prosecution stated that one venireperson was a lawyer for a public interest group, another had overly strong reaction to alleged racist comments, and another was too sympathetic given her disabled husband. The trial court denied the motion. The court affirmed, holding that it would defer to the trial court's findings regarding the credibility of the prosecution's explanations. One juror, a non-black learning disabled teacher, who was accepted by the prosecution, was also a crime victim and therefore, there was a legitimate reason for differentiating this juror from the excluded venireperson. The court vacated defendant's sentence because there was evidence that defendant could be an addict and because the trial court failed to inform him of the option of treatment under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 6360-2 (1989). The court remanded for defendant to be examined by a treatment program and a determination of whether he was an addict or alcoholic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance creating an appearance commission (commission), which had the power to hold hearings on the issuance of certificates of appropriateness of external appearance in connection with applications for building permits. The developer planned to build two three-story condominium units and submitted plans to the city. The plans met all applicable zoning and building code requirements. However, the commission denied the application. The developer filed an action against the city and the commission alleging that the regulation creating the commission was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the developer's motion for judgment on the pleadings and the court reversed and remanded for consideration of the writ of mandamus. The court held that the commission performed a declaratory function in granting or denying certificates and that the ordinance creating the commission was unconstitutional because it required the commission to consider excessive similarity, dissimilarity, or inappropriateness in exterior design and appearance of property in relation to nearby structures. The court held that it conferred unconstitutionally broad discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the potential for methane explosions was such that the board's action in adopting the monitoring requirement of Ill.

Code tit. 35, &sect; 811.310(d)(1)(F), the board rendered that section invalid because there was no opportunity for public hearing on the list. Although the regulation could impact adversely on the development of the gas processing industry, the court held that Ill. Admin. Code tit. 35, &sect; 811.312(b), (g)(1), had a legitimate purpose which was rationally related to the goals of the board. The court held that there was evidence to support the promulgation of Ill.

Code tit. 35, &sect; 813.106(b), which delayed the finality of board decisions, was invalid because it was in excess of the board's statutory authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Co-defendants sought review of the lower court judgment convicting them of home invasion and armed robbery. The court held that the trial court erred in denying the second co-defendant's attorney's motion that another attorney be appointed to represent the second co-defendant and that, therefore, the second co-defendant was denied his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to conflict-free counsel. The second co-defendant suffered from the joint representation because he did not have his attorney's exclusive loyalty and was represented by an attorney who was hostile to his own interests. The lower court's failure to appoint separate counsel or take adequate steps to determine whether the risk was too remote to warrant separate counsel constituted reversible error. However, the court held that the first co-defendant was property represented by his own conflict-free attorney. The court held that the jury instructions for armed robbery, which did not include a mental state as an essential element of the crime, were not erroneous.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipal corporation charged the property owners with zoning ordinance violations, including an allegation that &quot;junk&quot; had accumulated. In reversing an order granting the property owners summary judgment, the court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague. A personal of ordinary intelligence had a reasonable opportunity to know what conduct was lawful or unlawful. In affirming the denial of a preliminary injunction sought by the municipal corporation to remedy allegedly new conditions, the court held that there was no emergency presented by the addition of materials on the property. The denial was not an abuse of discretion. When the municipal corporation sought to amend its complaint prior to the grant of summary judgment, it should have been allowed, since the allegations were similar to those contained in the original complaint, the amendment was timely, and it would have been more efficient to resolve the new allegations in the current litigation rather than to require a new lawsuit. It was not error to allow the property owner to withdraw the defense of estoppel without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

At trial, the jury was instructed that if they found that defendant attempted to lure the children into his car without parental consent the jury could infer that it was done for an unlawful purpose. Defendant was convicted of two counts of child abduction, and the court affirmed. The court held that the evidence of the previous crime was admissible because it tended to show modus operandi and identity. The court ruled that the instruction did correctly inform the jury that the presumption of unlawful purpose was rebuttable because the court prefaced the presumption with the word &quot;may.&quot; The court held that because the legislature could reasonably find that attempted child abduction was a very serious offense, punishing attempted abduction to the same extent as abduction did not violate defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers owned real estate in the county. They alleged that the county and town unlawfully conspired to increase the assessed valuation of their land and other parcels of real estate that was used for mining and quarrying. They claimed that similar properties used for mining and quarrying in other townships within the county were not reassessed. The taxpayers argued that the county and town deprived them of their civil rights and their right to equal protection. The trial court dismissed the actions. The court affirmed and held that the trial court properly dismissed the complaints for failure to allege exhaustion of the plain, speedy, and efficient remedy available to them. The taxpayers were barred by the principle of comity from asserting 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 actions in federal courts. Because &sect; 1983 actions based on alleged unconstitutional reassessments could not be maintained in federal courts, there was even more reason for requiring and applying the court's own principles of administrative and judicial review, which was a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed from the order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that granted summary judgment to defendant state department of revenue (department) in the taxpayer's action that challenged the deficiencies of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act (ROT), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 441 (1989), and interest that were charged by the department in connection with the service charges imposed by the taxpayer for its banquets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department previously charged the taxpayer with deficiencies of ROT and interest in connection with the service charges it imposed on its banquet customers. For the audit period in question, although the taxpayer collected and remitted the proper amount of ROT on its charges for banquet food and beverages, it did not remit such tax on the service charges imposed in connection with the banquets. The taxpayer paid the amounts at issue under protest and filed an action in the circuit court for a review of the proposed deficiencies. The circuit court granted summary to the department. The court reversed and remanded the order that granted summary judgment to the department. The court held that a service charge was exempt under &sect; 2(e) of ROT if it was mandatory and separately stated on customers' bills. Furthermore, only that portion of the service charge that was turned over to the employees who would have received tips, absent the service charge, was not taxable. The court stated that the taxpayer's use of the monies collected from the service charge to cover the employer's expenses, such as shift pay, did not render those services charges exempt from the tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Bondholders filed suit against a railway and a trust company as successor trustee under the indenture created at the time of the issuance of the bonds. The bondholders contended that the railway had breached its contract by failing to pay the semi-annual interest due on the bond in gold coin or its equivalent as required under the terms of the bond and alleged the trust company had breached its fiduciary duty in allowing others to make interest payments in cash rather than in gold. The bondholders sought to permanently enjoin defendants from making interest or principal payments on the bonds in any other form other than gold coin or its equivalent, and sought compensatory damages for defendant's failure to make such payments. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment granting the railway and trust companies' motion to dismiss the suit and concluded that the Joint Resolution of 1933, or Abrogation Act, declared void the gold clauses in these bonds. The court held that the Act was a legitimate exercise of Congress's constitutional power over the monetary of the system and the exercise of such power did not depend upon the economic circumstances which precipitated its passage.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that his conviction for unlawful possession of weapons by a felon based on constructive possession violated his due process rights because it was lawful for his wife to own the guns in that she had a firearm owners' identification card (FOID). The court affirmed the conviction because defendant was the actual owner of the guns, the wife never used them, she applied for a FOID at her husband's suggestion as a subterfuge to avoid the fact that defendant could not be issued a permit due to his prior conviction, and defendant admitted to a police officer that the weapons were &quot;his guns.&quot; Thus defendant did much more than merely sleep in the house where his wife kept the guns. Accordingly, findings that defendant knew of the guns and that they were under his dominion and control did not offend due process. Defendant waived his argument against the admission of his son's testimony regarding prior conversations concerning the guns and, in any event, the evidence was relevant to show that defendant knew of the guns' existence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault for sexually assaulting his nine-year-old niece. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that the trial court erred by allowing an assistant state's attorney to testify regarding out-of-court statements made by defendant's niece and her mother. The trial court erred by failing to hold an Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-10(b)(1) hearing to determine the reliability of the niece's out-of-court statement. The trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury about the weight and credibility of the niece's statement as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-10(c). The trial court also erred by allowing the attorney to describe the mother's out-of-court statements about the niece's remarks as the attorney did not hear the niece's remarks personally as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-10(a)(2).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was in an automobile accident that killed a child and injured two others. Defendant was convicted of reckless homicide, driving under the influence of alcohol, and driving on a suspended driver's license. Defendant asserted that his first blood test was inadmissible because Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501.4 unconstitutionally conflicted with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 236, 134 Ill. 2d R. 236, testimony regarding his second blood test was improper, and his blood tests were improperly admitted as expert opinion. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501.4 was constitutionally valid because it permitted the admission of blood-alcohol test results only under very restricted circumstances that were limited to prosecutions for reckless homicide and driving under the influence. The court ruled that defendant waived the issue of chain of custody of his second blood sample because he did not object at trial to the sufficiency of the chain of custody. The court also held that defendant waived the issue of expert testimony because he did not argue or support his claim by citation to relevant authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was indicted on one count of aggravated criminal sexual assault, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-14-(a)(2) (1989) and one count of criminal sexual assault, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-14-(a)(1) (1989), filed a motion to dismiss the aggravated criminal sexual assault count on the ground that the injuries alleged, bruising and abrasion to the victim's vaginal wall and destruction of her hymen, did not warrant enhancement of the charge. On appeal of the trial court's order granting the motion, the court reversed. The court ruled that the definition of &quot;bodily harm&quot; under the aggravated criminal sexual assault statute included injuries to the victim's sexual organs, that the legislature intended that the term &quot;bodily injury&quot; be given a broad interpretation, and that the injuries alleged were adequate to charge defendant with aggravated criminal sexual assault. The court concluded that the vaginal injuries suffered by the victim were not the normal incident of a criminal sexual assault, as claimed by defendant, and thus could have served to enhance the offense charged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient sought review of orders by the Circuit Court of McHenry County (Illinois) that twice dismissed the patient's malpractice complaint against appellee healthcare providers, because the patient failed to comply with Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient claimed that Ill. Code Civ. P., 110 Ill. Comp. Stat. 2-622 (1989), violated the separation of powers principle, restricted free access to the courts, denied due process and equal protection, and was impermissibly vague. One of the healthcare providers requested the court to dismiss the patient's appeal and sanction the patient or his attorney. The court dismissed the patient's appeal and awarded one of the healthcare providers attorney fees against the patient's attorney, holding that the patient had failed to timely file a notice of appeal to the second order of the trial court that dismissed the patient's complaint for failing to comply with Rule 2-622 and that the trial court's first order of dismissal, which was without prejudice, was a nonappealable order, because it was not final. The court further held that the patient's attorney should have known the appeal was frivolous, that sanctions were appropriate against the patient's attorney pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 375, and ordered that the patient's attorney was required to pay the costs incurred by one of the healthcare providers for defending the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant, and on appeal, the court affirmed in part and remanded. The court held that &sect; 1401(a)(7)(ii) was not unconstitutionally vague because it was drafted in consideration of the means by which LSD was packaged and sold. LSD was commonly packaged in sheets, which were objects, that contained perforated units, which were segregated parts. Thus, &sect; 1401(a)(7)(ii) sufficiently gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of the prohibited conduct. The court also found that the state submitted sufficient evidence to prove defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, the court determined that defendant was entitled to have his street-value fine reduced by a credit for every day he spent in custody prior to his sentencing pursuant to Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Commission had reversed the local commission's decision to deny liquor licenses to the applicants. The local commission filed complaints for administrative review. The circuit court struck the complaints on the basis that the local commission lacked standing to seek administrative review. The court affirmed the decision. The court reasoned holding that the local commission was not a party aggrieved by reversal of its own administrative decision because it was a quasi-judicial body, and it had not been given a statutory grant of authority to seek administrative review. The court disagreed with the local commission's contention that it did not act in a quasi-judicial capacity and that the case relied upon by the circuit court did not apply. The argument lacked merit because it failed to consider the local commission's primary role. By statute, the local commission exercised quasi-judicial powers and had the authority to conduct hearings on complaints. The court concluded that the local commission's responsibility to protect the public interest did not authorize it to act as a representative of the public for the purpose of vindicating its own decision on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted judgment on the pleadings to plaintiff and defendant appealed. The court reversed the judgment on the pleadings in favor of plaintiff and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that judgment on the pleadings based upon defendant's invocation of the state constitutional privilege against self-incrimination in her answer to allegations of forgery was a violation of the privilege. The court concluded that the pleading requirements for answers in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-610 (1989) yielded to the constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment. The court stated that there was no evidence establishing that defendant suffered any injury while in police custody, and that ample evidence supported the finding that defendant made the statement voluntarily. The court found that the prosecutor's failure to investigate defendant's allegation that the police hit him, in light of the other contradictory evidence, did not constitute a denial of due process. The court stated that the question of intent was for the trier of fact, and that it was unable to say that the trial court's express finding that defendant specifically intended to kill the victim was error. The court rejected defendant's claims that his conduct supported only one conviction, and that the trial court's failure to state in the record its opinion that a consecutive term was necessary to protect the public rendered the consecutive sentences improper.</SPAN></P>

The evidence established that defendant had lived in the subject premises, an apartment building, and knew that children and a severely retarded person resided there. The evidence indicated that defendant set the fire at night, when most of the residents were asleep, which resulted in many of them awakening when the building was already engulfed in flames and required them to jump out windows to save themselves.

Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1 (1987), because the statute was not in effect at the time of the offense. The court determined that the statute was not invalid as being an ex post facto law and affirmed the conviction. Prior to July 1, 1987, the state had the burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, the elements of murder. The defendant then had the opportunity to present evidence of a factor in mitigation, serious provocation or unreasonable belief, either of which must have been present to reduce an offense of murder to voluntary manslaughter. The amended statute did not change the elements of the crime, but it defined the offenses of first and second degree murder, and shifted the burden of proof to a defendant, to prove by a preponderance of the evidence, one of the factors in mitigation to reduce an offense of first degree murder to second degree murder. However, in this case defendant did not attempt to prove a mitigating factor, he relied instead on an alibi defense so the change had no effect on the defense and the new statute did not criminalize behavior that was previously lawful.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), for first degree murder and sentence of 28 years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to 28 years' imprisonment for first degree murder. The court found that, in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the trial court could have found the essential elements of first degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt. Sufficient evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that defendant did not believe the victim was threatening him with imminent death or great bodily harm when he shot the victim, given that the shot entered the back of the victim's head, no weapons were found on the victim, and testimony revealed the victim was running away when shot. The court ruled that defendant's Sixth Amendment right to conflict-free counsel was not violated by the trial court's refusal of defendant's last minute request to appoint counsel other than his private counsel because the trial court made sufficient inquiry into defendant's claims and was not obliged to honor the request. The court ruled that the trial court erred in its belief in sentencing defendant that the crime was drug related because no one testified that defendant or the victim was involved in drug dealings, or that the argument between them was drug related.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and remanded the cause for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, City of Elmhurst Building Department and the Illinois Department of Transportation, Division of Water Resources (DWR), sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which denied the DWR injunctive relief under &sect; 18f of the Rivers Act. The DWR sought a mandatory injunction against appellee company to remove two berms and a lift station that it constructed adjacent to its properties on the Salt Creek.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company built a shopping center and a berm to control flood waters. It also constructed a hotel directly to the north. Before the hotel was complete, the DWR granted the company a permit that excluded the construction of a berm and did not include a lift station. The DWR was not aware that the lift had been built or that a berm was later built. The DWR sought a mandatory injunction for the removal of the shopping center berm and amended the claim for the removal of the hotel berm and lift station. On appeal, the court held that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to review the permit conditions because the company failed to seek administrative review of the permit conditions within the required 35-day period. The court reversed the portion of the circuit court's order denying the DWR injunctive relief as to the hotel berm. The court also reversed the decision of the circuit court, holding that it erred in applying general equitable principles when it refused to issue a statutory injunction as to the construction of the lift station. It affirmed the circuit court as regards to the shopping center berm because the DWR was not diligent in requiring the company to remove it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order denying a mandatory injunction as to the remaining shopping center berm. The court reversed the trial court's order denying the DWR injunctive relief as to the hotel berm and reversed the trial court's decision not to enjoin the construction of the lift station.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the Illinois Department of Public Aid (department), filed a petition for adjudication of contempt on behalf of the wife, asking that defendant husband be held in contempt of court for failure to pay child support and seeking child support arrearage. The Circuit Court of Douglas County (Illinois) ordered that the statute of limitations barred the collection of a large portion of the payments. The department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the entry of the divorce decree wherein the husband was ordered to pay weekly child support, he made no child support payments. The husband argued that the appeal was untimely filed as it was based on the prior order addressing the barring of arrearage pursuant to the five-year statute of limitations in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 13-205 (1987). The department claimed that the 20-year statute of limitations applicable to judgments contained in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 13-218 (1987) applied to the divorce decree. The court reversed the trial court's decision, holding that: (1) the appeal was timely because the there was no Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 304 finding as to the prior order and thus it was not appealable as it did not dispose of all of the department's claims against the husband; and (2) the trial court erred as a matter of law in applying the five-year statute of limitations to the arrearage because the 20-year limitation on enforcement of judgments was applicable. The court noted that the department's pleadings seeking the payments originally ordered by the divorce decree were sufficient to effect revival of the decree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment finding that collection of certain arrearage of child support owed by the husband was barred by the five-year statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
