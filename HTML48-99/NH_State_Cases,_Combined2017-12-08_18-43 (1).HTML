</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sold LSD and marijuana to two undercover officers. He argued that he was entitled to acquittal because it should have been found as a matter of law that he was entrapped and because N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 318-A:21 was unconstitutional in that it provided for a mandatory sentence and forbade the trial court to suspend any part of the sentence. The trial court submitted the issue of entrapment to the jury and defendant did not object to the instructions as given. The court determined that the trial court was not required to find entrapment as a matter of law because the evidence did not undisputedly show that the officers lured defendant into an action that he was not predisposed to take. Instead, the court found that the evidence demonstrated that defendant was ready to commit the crime and that the troopers only furnished him the opportunity. The court also declined to consider defendant's constitutional argument because the trial court was permitted to reconsider defendant's sentence, which would have rendered his constitutional argument moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporate taxpayer sought an injunction to prevent the municipality from instituting a redevelopment project. The trial court denied the corporate taxpayer's petition. On appeal, the corporate argued that the municipality did not have the power to build a parking garage as part of its redevelopment project under the powers conferred on it by N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 205. The corporate taxpayer also argued that the municipality did not have authority to provide public funds for the construction of a parking garage without complying with N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 252-A. The court rejected the corporate taxpayer's arguments. The court found that the parking garage was an essential part of the redevelopment project, which had been determined to serve a public purpose and therefore the municipality had the authority to build the parking garage. The court also found that the municipality could construct a parking garage without complying with N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 252-A (Supp. 1969) because the public policy against implied repeal of statutes and the broad authority granted by N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 205 already provided the municipality with the appropriate authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A task force of 300 citizens was assembled to make recommendations modernizing the operation and financing of state government. Central among the recommendations was the enactment of a uniform tax at a common rate on all net profits derived from the ownership and operation of business organizations, corporate or unincorporated, doing business within the state. An opinion of the justices was sought regarding the constitutionality of the proposed tax. The justices determined that no constitutional barrier stood in the way of the levy of a general income tax at a uniform rate. The New Hampshire Constitution did not require the rate of a tax upon net income to be uniform with that of the existing interest and dividends tax. The justices determined that the proposed tax upon business income would be constitutional, and need not be levied at the rate of other state taxes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The justices issued an opinion stating that the proposed tax upon business income would be constitutional, and need not be levied at the rate of other state taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants appealed an order of the Cheshire County Court (New Hampshire), which, after arraignment but before a plea, denied their motion to quash the indictments charging them with unlawfully selling a narcotic drug, marijuana, in violation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 318-A:2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants sought to quash their indictments for unlawfully selling marijuana in violation of &sect; 318-A:2, contending that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 318-A:21 II, which established the penalty at a minimum of five years, also provided that the imposition or execution of sentence would not be suspended, and was, therefore, invalid as an unconstitutional encroachment upon the court's judicial power. The trial court transferred the question without ruling. On consideration of defendants' argument, the court remanded the matter to the trial court, holding that the legislative branch had repealed N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 318-A and enacted N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 318-B (Supp.), and that because ch. 318-B was then effective and N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 318-A had been repealed, neither the mandatory minimum sentence nor the prohibition against suspension of sentence would apply to defendants, who had not been tried. Thus, the constitutional question raised was moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings on defendants' indictments for unlawfully selling a narcotic drug.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the statute could not be equated with those statutes that provided for the furnishing of transportation or books directly to the children. The court ruled that the aid granted by the statute was directly and not incidentally to institutions, an important purpose of which was to provide religious instruction.

After the State failed to file any counter-affidavits, the corporate seller moved that a judgment be entered in its favor in accordance with N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 491:8a (Supp.). The trial court granted judgment in favor of the corporate seller. Thereafter, the State moved to strike its default in failure to file its counter-affidavits, contending accident, mistake, and misfortune. On appeal, the court remanded, finding that the State was subject to the requirements of &sect; 491:8-a (Supp.) because it had consented to the action, which was founded upon an express or implied contract. Moreover, the court found that &sect; 491:8-a (Supp.) did not preclude consideration of the State's motion as a matter of law. Although the State failed to file its counter-affidavit within 15 days was an admission of the fact that the account was unpaid and owing, the trial court was not without discretion to determine whether it should have been relieved from the admission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A criminal complaint charged that the defendant &quot;did parade on a public highway, to wit, Route 108 in said Town of Durham, contrary to the laws and ordinances relating thereto, and in violation of Chapter 286:2 of R.S.A. of New Hampshire.&quot; After trial in the Durham district court the defendant was found guilty and entered an appeal to the Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal in the Superior Court there was an agreed statement of facts as follows: &quot;On April 21, 1966 a procession of 20 to 25 persons, carrying placards above their heads related to peace and disarmament, entered the Town of Durham along a public highway, walking in orderly fashion on the unpaved shoulder and sidewalks.  The Durham Chief of Police advised the defendant, a member of the procession, to lower his sign or be subject to arrest for parading without a permit.  Defendant refused to lower his sign and was arrested, pleaded not guilty, was fined $ 25 in Durham District Court, and appealed the conviction.  During this trial in District Court, the Chief of Police testified that a parade permit for April 21, 1966 had been applied for and denied.  Said application was made by a person or persons&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not connected with the defendant or the procession mentioned above.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant contends that the conviction violated his constitutional rights and that the ordinance of the town of Durham and the statute (RSA 286:2) are invalid and unconstitutional.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal (RSA 31:77) from a decision of the Goffstown board of adjustment denying plaintiff's petition for an exception to the Goffstown zoning ordinance of 1961 regulating motor vehicle junk yards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff, whose full-time occupation is that of a sheet metal worker, is the joint owner of premises at 171 Shirley Hill Road in Goffstown on which are stored several (5 to 20) unregistered vehicles.  The plaintiff had made this use of his premises for a number of years prior to adoption of the ordinance in 1961.  The ordinance (Art. VII (I)) defines a motor vehicle junk yard as &quot;any place of storage . . . which has stored or deposited two or more unregistered motor vehicles which are no longer intended or in condition for legal use on the public highways . . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A motor vehicle junk yard is not a permitted use in a residential district in which the plaintiff resides.  Although the ordinance in general allows the continuance of nonconforming uses existing on its passage, it has the following provision (Art. IV (F) 5) as to junk yards: &quot;Junk Yards.  No junk yard or motor vehicle junk yard, may continue as a non-conforming use for more than one year&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  after the effective date of this ordinance, except that a junk yard may continue as a nonconforming use if within that period it is completely screened from view of any public highway or adjacent property and is maintained thereafter in accordance with the standards provided by the Revised Statutes Annotated of New Hampshire, Chapter 267.&quot; The plaintiff has not screened his junk yard as provided in this article.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff was notified of his violation of the ordinance on August 20, 1963.  Efforts to negotiate a settlement with the town of Goffstown failed and on November 12, 1963 the plaintiff petitioned for a special exception in accordance with Article VI (b) 2 of the ordinance.  After hearing the Goffstown board of adjustment denied the plaintiff's petition and on June 30, 1964 denied a motion for rehearing.  In denying the plaintiff's petition the board of adjustment made the following findings: &quot;The members of the Board pointed out that this area is directly across from St. Anselm's College and would certainly detract from the beautiful campus along Shirley Hill Road.  The members of the Board indicated that they could see no reason for an exception or variance and that the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  land was certainly suited for things other than junk yard purposes and should be confined to those purposes of the district in which it is located.&quot; On appeal to the Superior Court, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Keller</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, J. specifically decided that the &quot;findings of the Board are reasonable and constitute sufficient grounds for denying an exception.&quot; The Court dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the board of adjustment on April 21, 1965.  The plaintiff's exceptions to the findings and decree of the Court were reserved and transferred.  </SPAN></P>

The impairment of the right results from 262-A:65 RSA which provides that defendant's license is suspended pending appeal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petition for declaratory judgment by the town of Hampton, and its selectmen individually as residents and taxpayers, against Hampton Beach Improvement Company and its share or stockholders.  Hampton Beach Improvement Company, Inc. was permitted to intervene as a party defendant.  The petition seeks to have adjudged null and void a lease dated April 1, 1898 by which the town leased to the company a tract of land on Hampton Beach, for a term of 99 years, or to have declared as illegal or void certain provisions in this lease regarding the town's liability as lessor to pay the taxes imposed upon the leased land.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parties reserved questions of law from the Rockingham County court (New Hampshire) in the declaratory judgment action brought by plaintiffs, municipal lessor (lessor) and selectmen, against defendants, corporate lessee (lessee) and shareholders, and intervenor defendant successor corporation to have a lease adjudged null and void or to have its provisions as to the lessor's liability for taxes on the leased land declared void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The lessor and the lessee entered into a lease for land for a term of 99 years that provided that the lessee would make improvements and that the lessor would pay any taxes on the land. The lessee failed to comply with 1933 N.H. Laws 318 and its corporate charter was annulled. The successor corporation was formed to carry on the lessee's business and the shareholders transferred their rights in the lease to the successor corporation. The lessor sought a declaratory judgment that would obviate its liability to pay taxes on the leased land and, in advance of further proceedings in the action, the parties reserved questions to the court that pertained to the effect on the lease of the lessee's dissolution and the validity of the lease's tax covenants. The court held that the lease did not terminate with the lessee's dissolution and that the shareholders succeeded to the rights under the lease. There was no restriction against assignment in the lease and no relation of trust and confidence that precluded an assignment. The tax covenants were binding on the lessor and were not repugnant to the rules of uniformity and equality in N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 12 and pt. II, art. 5.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court answered the parties' reserved questions of law affirmatively in part, and negatively in part, and remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus against defendant, alleging that he was unlawfully restrained in the county jail. After a hearing, the petition was denied and the case reserved and transferred. The sole issue transferred was whether plaintiff was illegally detained in jail because the clerk of the Superior Court refused to accept a $ 3,000 bail bond. The money was tendered by an insurance company that was not registered as a professional bondsman under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 598:2. The Supreme Court held that the insurance company was not properly licensed to serve as a professional bondsman. The language of &sect; 598:2 plainly implied that unregistered professional bondsmen, or those not financially responsible were not acceptable as sureties. Because &sect; 598:2 applied to a corporate surety, the clerk was justified in refusing to accept the bond.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, a water commission and various municipalities, petitioned the Strafford County Superior Court (New Hampshire) for an adjudication of water rights and for injunctive relief to bar defendant United States from conveying a dam to defendant city for its exclusive use. The case was removed to federal district court, but subsequently remanded. Defendants then filed special pleas of sovereign immunity and motions to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In connection with the establishment of a military base, the United States entered into a contract to supply water to the city in exchange for conveyance of the necessary lands. When it was determined that wells would not be a sufficient water source, the United States decided to acquire by eminent domain the water rights on a river, build a dam and reservoir thereon, and convey the dam to the city. The water commission and municipalities then brought a class action, purporting to act on behalf of all interested parties and alleging that the municipalities had prior appropriative statutory preemptive rights in the water, such that use of the water for the city's sole benefit constituted a taking of property without due process of law. In dismissing the petition, the court ruled that, although plaintiffs purported to bring a class action, no judgment could bind riparian owners of the river who had not been joined in the action. Thus, it was merely a private suit, not a class action to adjudicate the rights of all owners, as required to establish jurisdiction over the United States under the McCarran Amendment, 43 U.S.C.S. &sect; 666.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The petition of the water commission and municipalities for declaratory and injunctive relief was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant towns sought review of the decision of a trial court (New Hampshire) that entered judgment in favor of plaintiff school cooperative in the cooperative's action seeking to compel the towns to comply with the statutory mandate contained in 1959 N.H. Laws 195.1 regarding the apportionment of the financial aid for the cooperative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The statutory mandated contained in &sect; 195.1 differed from the written agreement that the school cooperative and its participating towns had agreed to when the school cooperative was created. The towns argued that because all of the towns participating in the school cooperative agreed to and relied on the original formula for the apportionment of the financial costs of the school cooperative, the cooperative should be estopped from asserting a position inconsistent with that method of financial apportionment. The court remanded the cause, finding that the cooperative was not estopped from arguing that the statutory method of allocating costs took precedence over the parties' agreement. The court explained that the fact that the receipt of state aid together with the computation of the operating costs of the district school according to the formula contained &sect; 196.1 authorizing the creation of such a district resulted in one town in the district having to raise more dollars per pupil attending the cooperative school than another town in the same district did not place an unequal tax burden on any inhabitant of a particular taxing district.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The citizen's basic problem with the districts was that there was too great a population differential between them. He asserted that this population difference violated the one-man, one-vote edict contained in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The court denied the injunction and continued the declaratory judgment action. It noted that the discrepancy between the populations in the two districts was well within the parameters set forth in prior U.S. Supreme Court decisions. It also recognized, however, that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 63:4, 5 reflected an apportionment established more than a decade before and that it might, therefore, be constitutionally suspect. The court believed that the issue might be taken up by the next state legislature. The court refused to grant the injunction because an election was imminent and an injunction would be unnecessarily disruptive. But it continued the declaratory judgment petition pending any action the state legislature might take up on the issue of congressional reapportionment.</SPAN></P>

The owner of the junkyard challenged a decree of the trial court (New Hampshire) enjoining him from burning automobiles on his property in violation of Plaistow, NH Zoning Ordinance art. VII, B (1956). The ordinance required a special permit after one year of operating a junkyard in a nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>

The owner of the junkyard burned automobiles, which caused &quot;black, oily, rubbery smoke&quot; to blow across the complainant's land on the prevailing winds, and at times into his house. The junking operations also made considerable noise. The trial court had issued an order enjoining the burning of automobiles at the junkyard. The owner of the junkyard claimed that he had not violated a zoning ordinance that prohibited the operation of a junkyard for more than one year because he had operated it before the town enacted the ordinance. The court affirmed the decree enjoining the burning of cars on the property. The court held that the town had substantially complied with N.H. Rev. Stat.

The court noted that in a prior proceeding in this state, the alleged father was under no duty to provide support for the minor child because his paternity had never been established. The court then pointed out that the foreign state did not have authority to enter a judgment against the alleged father when he was never present in or subject to the foreign state's jurisdiction.

During a protest of the exercise of the law, defendants were arrested and tried. They filed a motion to quash in the municipal court, which denied it. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the detailed provisions of the statute delineating the authority did not constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative power. The court reasoned that the order to take shelter was no more a violation of defendants' constitutional rights of free speech and peaceable assembly under either the state or federal constitution. The law was designed to insure protection against injury to individual pedestrians who were required to take shelter, but also, and more essentially to insure the protection and welfare of the general public, through the establishment of orderly procedures to be followed in the event of emergency or disaster. There was no unconstitutional invasion of defendants' rights of free speech and peaceable assembly under the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, a milk distributor, filed a bill in equity in the Superior Court (New Hampshire) seeking to vacate an order of defendant Milk Control Board (New Hampshire), which revoked the distributor's nine distributor's licenses and denied its application for an out-of-state distributor's license. From this bill, the superior court permitted the distributor to file an appeal, or petition for certiorari, to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court rejected the Board's claim that the distributor's failure to seek an administrative appeal precluded him from appealing to the court as the constitutionality of the Board's procedures and its interpretation of the milk control act were at issue. In this regard, the court held that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann &sect; 183:7, which did not expressly proscribe greater particularization of factors to be considered in establishing &quot;just and reasonable&quot; prices, was not invalid as the Board was bound to consider the costs incurred by the distributor. The Board's findings as set forth in its order to continue price controls were sufficient to warrant the continuation of existing controls and the findings were warranted by the evidence. Although the Board violated its own rule that there would be no cross-examination of witness, such violation did not rise to the level of reversible error. The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and authority in requiring additional licenses for the plaintiff's five retail outlets. This error of law was open to correction on a writ of certiorari. A license to sell within the state was not a prerequisite to acquiring a license to sell outside the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court upheld the constitutionality of the milk control statutes. The court sustained the distributor's appeal from the Board's order requiring additional licenses for the distributor's five retail outlets and then denying the licenses. The court sustained the appeal from the Board's order denying the distributor's out-of-state license. Both orders were remanded to the Board for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that the apportionment of senatorial districts by the method provided in the New Hampshire Constitution and the manner provided by 1961 N.H. Laws ch. 273 was unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of U.S. Const., amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff contended that the apportionment of senatorial districts according to the proportion of direct taxes paid by the districts resulted in unequal representation because there was variation in the equalized valuation of the individual districts. The court held that such variation, which never reached five percent and which generally hovered at three percent of the average valuation, was neither an impermissible classification nor an invidious discrimination. The variations in equalized valuation, which represented the variation in direct taxes, were to some extent inevitable and in some degree unavoidable due to geography and contiguity. N.H. Const. art. 26 required that districts be made without dividing towns or unincorporated places. And the districts were roughly similar to what they would be if based upon population. Urban areas were not underrepresented. The court concluded that although the system might not be the court's preference, it was not without rational basis and did not produce an unrepresentative selection for the senate. Therefore, it violated neither the federal nor the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, a local school district and the City of Keene, New Hampshire, challenged a prevailing wage determination issued by defendant New Hampshire Commissioner of Labor pursuant to the state's public contract &quot;prevailing wage&quot; law, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 280. Plaintiffs asserted that the legislature had unconstitutionally delegated its legislative prerogative by allowing the Commissioner to determine local prevailing wage rates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Chapter 280 imposed prevailing wage requirements on all contractors awarded public contracts in the state. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 280:2 left the determination of applicable prevailing wage rates to the Commissioner; N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 280:3 (Supp.) allowed any impacted party to appeal to the Appeal Board if they disputed the rates adopted by the Commissioner. Plaintiffs filed the action after the Board set the prevailing rates for a contract. Plaintiffs asserted that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 280 was unconstitutional and that the Board was impermissibly biased because one of its members was an organized labor representative. The appeal was dismissed. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional because the legislature had provided sufficient basic standards and a reasonably definite policy for its administration. The legislature could vest the Commissioner with discretionary authority to implement the law. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 280:3 (Supp.) provided that organized labor should be represented on the Board and therefore the participation of an organized labor Board member in the decision was not grounds to reverse the Commissioner's order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The company filed an action against the competitors that alleged unfair trade competition. In response, the competitors contended that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 357 violated the due process clause of N.H. Const. art. 15, pt.

The court held that that the competitors' claim that the fair trade law violated N.H. Const. art. 15, pt. I could not prevail. Additionally, the court found that the company established a fair-trade program into which the dealers, including the competitors, entered voluntarily by acquiring the goods with notice of minimum resale prices. Therefore, the court concluded that the competitors' knowledge of the establishment of the minimum resale prices carried with it, upon every principle of fair dealing, assent to the protective restriction, with consequent liability.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged in trial court (New Hampshire) with violating the hit-and-run statute,&nbsp;N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 262:23, for failing to return to the scene of an accident that involved property damage, and that had occurred in the parking lot of a private club. He filed exceptions, challenging the statute's constitutionality, and arguing that the accident did not occur on a public highway or way.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In considering defendant's arguments, the court noted that the hit-and-run statute did not specify that the accident had to occur on a public highway or way but was silent on the question. The court noted the general rule that if a motor vehicle statute made no reference to the offenses occurring on a public highway, courts usually held that the statute applied generally throughout the state. In addition, the fact that the statute did not specify that the hit-and-run offense had to occur on public highways was some indication that the legislature did not intend to limit its application. The statute had also been amended from time to time without the addition of such a provision. The court concluded that it was just as necessary to report accidents that occurred on private property. Accordingly, it ruled that application of the hit-and-run statute was not limited to public highways or ways, and that the statute applied to the club's parking lot. The court further ruled that the statute was constitutional. Whether operating a vehicle was a privilege or a right, it was subject to reasonable conditions such as the reporting requirement in the hit-and-run statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The brewing company distributed its malt beverages through a wholesaler. It reduced the territory of the wholesaler and the Commission found that the brewing company violated N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 181:26. The brewing company petitioned for review. The court denied the petition and found that the Commission's interpretation of the statute was valid. The court found that the laws controlling alcoholic beverages were to interpreted according to the legislative intent designed to regulate the industry as a whole and to prevent one licensee from controlling another, under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 181:27. The court found that the evidence could support the conclusion that the brewing company's actions were innocent or that they were an attempt to control the wholesaler, and the court was not free to overturn the Commission's findings when they were supported by the evidence. The court found that the statute was within the scope of the plenary power of the state and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court was requested to give its opinion on the constitutionality of a House Bill intended to reimburse innocent depositors of a trust company for losses suffered. The court held that the proposed bill appropriated state money to reimburse private depositors for losses already incurred and violated the constitutional prohibition against taxation to aid private purposes or parties under N.H. Const., Pt. II, art. 5th. Unconditional aid was not a proper charge of government to be met by the taxpayers. Banks are regulated in the public interest but their failure or financial losses do not create a state debt that can be met by the appropriation of public funds. Thus the House Bill was in violation of the State Constitution. An amendment to the bill to reimburse bank depositors who had suffered losses of funds because of other bank failures in New Hampshire during prior years would likewise be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The lower court entered judgment for the victim and transferred without ruling the question whether she was entitled to prejudgment interest. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that it was not error to submit the question of contributory negligence to the jury because there was evidence to support the finding that the accident would have occurred even if the car had reached its position without backing into the street. The court also held that the victim was entitled to interest on the verdict from the date of the writ under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 524:1-b (Supp. 1957). The statute could be applied retroactively because it did not impair any vested rights, create a new obligation, or impose a new duty. The statute was only declarative of the common law.</SPAN></P>

First, the Legislature asked whether the law violated the state or federal Constitutions or any federal statutes relative to bank holding companies. Second, the Legislature inquired whether a regulatory bill providing for the approval or disapproval by a bank holding company commission of the acquisition of the stock of a bank by a bank holding company conflicted with or violated the state or federal Constitutions or any federal statute. Third, the Legislature asked whether a bill limiting the total deposits or resources that a bank holding company could acquire through acquisition of stock of other banks conflicted with or violated the state or federal Constitutions. The court answered &quot;no&quot; to the first two questions, explaining that the law would not have been invalid unless it were found to have interfered with the purposes of the national banks, to have destroyed their efficiency, or if was in direct conflict with some paramount federal law. Banking was peculiarly subject to regulation by the State in the exercise of its police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The public utility sold its motor bus operation to the transit company. The sale was approved by the public utility's board of directors and the Public Utilities Commission. The minority stockholder commenced a derivative suit claiming that the sale was illegal because it was consummated without a stockholders' vote. The court held that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 374:32, a statute concerning transfers involving public utilities, was permissive rather than mandatory in regard to shareholder approval. Based on the legislative history of the statute the court held that a transfer of utility property had to be approved by a stockholders' vote only if the Commission determined that the public good so required. Further, the &quot;public good&quot; was not an unconstitutional or unlawful standard. The court also held that the statutory remedy for dissenting stockholders provided by &sect; 374:32 was exclusive and not alternative. Based on its answers to these two transferred questions the court held that the sale of the transportation business was not illegal because approval by a stockholders' vote was not required and that the remedy under the statute was exclusive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court examined proposed N.H. Senate Bill No. 117. The court determined that the proposed senate bill, if enacted into law, would permit use of a trust estate for purposes that might not lawfully be used. The court found that the effect of the bill would be an exercise of what amounted to a legislative power of cy pres with respect to all cemetery trusts having surplus income, without regard to established principles of law relating to the use of such funds or the terms of the trusts so long as they did not expressly forbid the use. The court concluded that the Legislature could not constitutionally accomplish that. The court found that such action would amount to an invasion of established equitable powers of the courts in violation of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 37. In essence the bill proposed to abolish the judicial function with respect to a subject essentially judicial in its nature and substituted for that judicial function a legislative determination. The court held that such an effect was not permitted by the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives transmitted a copy of a resolution passed by the House with a copy of House Bill No. 187, and the House Journal of January 30, 1957, to the clerk of the court for it to consider whether Bill No. 187, which was entitled &quot;An Act to redistrict the state into senatorial districts&quot; was constitutional. The court addressed four questions that the House submitted to it for answers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Question 1. What was the proper interpretation of N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 26 in making the division of senatorial districts? Answer: The state had to divide into districts without dividing towns and unincorporated places so that the districts could govern themselves by the proportion of direct taxes paid by the districts. Question 2. What taxes were &quot;direct taxes&quot; under art. 26? Answer: &quot;Direct taxes&quot; meant taxes upon polls and estates. The districts had to be established so that the direct taxes paid by the towns and unincorporated places in any district were in the same proportion as those paid by the towns and unincorporated places of any other district, or as nearly so as practicable without dividing towns. Question 3. Did House Bill No. 187 violate art. 26 because the redistricting was based on the equalized valuation figures of the state tax commission? Answer: Redistricting based upon equalized valuation figures supplied by the state tax commission was not unconstitutional. Question: 4. Did House Bill No. 187 violate the New Hampshire Constitution? Answer: The bill on its face appeared constitutional, but the court would not answer the question without specific facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The wild boar kept by the corporation escaped and caused damage to the landowners' lands and crops. The landowners brought an action in trespass, strict liability, and common law liability. The court found that an examination of case law indicated a clear tendency to limit strict liability to those cases where the legislature had provided for it or to those situations where the common law of the state had imposed such liability and the legislature had not seen fit to change it. The court held that, in view of the policy evidenced by an unbroken line of decisions which imposed liability at common law for negligence only, it would not adopt a rule of absolute liability for injuries to persons and property caused by wild animals as a general principle of law. The court also held that the landowners had made a case for trespass to real estate and for trespass under the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs attacked the validity of certain provisions of the act. The court dismissed plaintiffs' bill and held that redevelopment projects constituted a valid public purpose for which public funds could be appropriated and the power of eminent domain could be exercised. Plaintiffs specifically challenged the act because it allowed the housing authority to make the land in a redevelopment project available for sale or lease to public or private agencies. The court held a resale or lease with conditions consistent with the redevelopment plan was an essential and continuing part of the act's public purpose. The court also held that it was not necessary that every building in a blighted area be in a blighted condition before the entire area could be condemned. It was sufficient that the taking as a whole was reasonably necessary to the clearance of the blighted area and prevention of its recurrence. The act did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority to the housing authority. Nor did the act permit the city to expend funds for the benefit of persons who would purchase or lease the land, in violation of N.H. Const. part II, art. 5.</SPAN></P>

Laws 1953, the attorney general was authorized and directed to make full and complete investigation with respect to violations of the Act and to determine whether subversive persons as defined in the Act were then located in New Hampshire. The attorney general was authorized to require by subpoena the attendance of such witnesses and the production of such documents as he deemed advisable and to make public such information received by him as he deemed fit to effectuate the purposes of the resolution. The court ruled on several issues: (1) The fact that the resolution required an investigation with respect to violations of law as well as a determination of whether subversive persons were located within New Hampshire did not change the inquiry from a legislative investigation to a criminal inquisition. (2) The resolution was not impermissibly aimed at providing assistance in the criminal prosecution of a particular individual. (3) Questions concerning plaintiff's membership in the Communist Party were material to a determination of whether she was a member of a subversive organization.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, parent of a delinquent minor child, appealed the judgment of a superior court (New Hampshire), which denied the parent's habeas corpus petition filed against defendant trustees of the State Industrial School.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Proceedings were instituted pursuant to N.H. Rev. Laws ch. 132 for the committal of the child. She was found to be delinquent and committed to the school. The parent filed a petition alleging that N.H. Rev. Laws ch. 132, &sect; 2(II), which defined &quot;delinquent child&quot; was unconstitutional and that N.H. Rev. Laws ch. 132 provided for imprisonment of a minor child without requiring that the child be either charged with or convicted of a crime. The trial court denied the petition. On appeal, the court found that the petition was properly denied. Ch. 132 was designed to permit the exercise of the powers of the state as &quot;parens patriae&quot; for the purpose of rehabilitating minor children, and not of punishing them for the commission of a crime. There was no evidence to suggest that the school was other than a real school, not a prison in disguise, or that committal to it was not a reasonably necessary restraint, rather than imprisonment. The court concluded that Ch. 132 was constitutional. Constitutional guarantees applicable to criminal proceedings were inapplicable to the delinquency proceeding. The trial court had the authority to defer committal under its continuing jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court overruled the parent's exceptions to the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The ordinance required nonresident photographers to pay a license fee, but did not require resident photographers to pay the same license fee or any substantially equivalent charges. The court found that even if the challenged ordinance was not designed for the purpose of discriminating against the non-resident photographer, it clearly had that effect. The cumulative burden of such an ordinance in various municipalities throughout the state, as applied to the photographer, who photographed high school graduating classes year after year, constituted a barrier to interstate commerce that was impermissible. The court stated that while interstate commerce could be required to pay its way, it had to be placed on a plane of equality with local trade and commerce. The present ordinance did not accomplish that objective and was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The store challenged N.H. Laws 204, &sect; 2, which prohibited the sale of merchandise below cost with the effect of injuring competitors or destroying competition. The store argued that &sect; 2 was unconstitutional because it was unduly oppressive and contrary to accepted economic and social standards. The court found &sect; 2 to be valid because the Legislature required either intent or the effect of injuring or destroying competition. The court also upheld the portion of &sect; 2 which provided that advertisements or sales below cost were prima facie evidence of a violation because no conclusive presumption of guilt was created and &quot;prima facie evidence&quot; had limited effect in New Hampshire. However, the court found that the latter portion of N.H. Laws 204, &sect; 1 (IV), applicable to computing cost, was invalid due to its indefiniteness and uncertainty, but also found that the invalid provision was severable from the rest of the Act. The court further held that, because the enactment of the Act was within the power of the Legislature granted to it by the Constitution, its wisdom, effectiveness, and economic desirability was not a judicial question.</SPAN></P>
