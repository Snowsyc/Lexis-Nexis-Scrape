Appellant claimed that the trial court invaded its U.S. Const. amend. I rights and misapplied the cy pres doctrine. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that ecclesiastical concerns were incidental and remote because this case dealt with the disposition of church property, and therefore the establishment clause of U.S. Const. amend. I was not offended. The court held that the cy pres doctrine was correctly applied because the assets of appellant were divided between two churches of similar fundamentalist persuasion which were nearest geographically to appellant's town thus preserving the intent of appellant's benefactors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged by information with a violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11355 for agreeing to sell a narcotic and then delivering a non-narcotic substance. After they were held to answer, the superior court granted their motions to set aside the information. The People appealed. The police informant seized a substance from one defendant that was not cocaine or any other controlled substance although defendants promised cocaine. It was a crime to agree to sell a narcotic and then to deliver instead a non-narcotic substance. The trial court set aside the information because there was no delivery and, therefore, a necessary element of &sect; 11355 was missing. The offense defined by &sect; 11355 consisted of two elements: first, a &quot;deal&quot; to supply a controlled substance, and, second, some activity with respect to any other liquid, substance, or material in apparent consummation. The order was reversed and remanded for further proceedings because defendants delivered a non-narcotic substance in violation of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order dismissing the informations against defendants was reversed because defendants could still be charged with delivering narcotics although the substance that they actually delivered was a non-narcotic substance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which convicted appellant, on a jury verdict, for three counts of using a minor as an agent to furnish controlled substances in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11380.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of three counts of using a minor as an agent to furnish controlled substances in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11380. Appellant sought the court's review, asserting various points of error, including that the five-year minimum prison term provided for her offense constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The court held that in examining whether a particular punishment was so disproportionate to the offense such that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment, three factors were considered. Those factors were the nature of the offense and/or the offender, the penalties imposed in the state for more serious crimes, and the penalties imposed by other states for the same offense. Here, the legislature determined that a violation of &sect; 11380 was morally reprehensible and serious enough to merit a severe and certain penalty. Further, because &sect; 11380 was designed to protect children, great deference was given to the legislature's judgment. Additionally, examinations of penalties imposed in the state and elsewhere did not indicate appellant was being cruelly or unusually punished. Judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of conviction was affirmed where the minimum mandatory sentence imposed upon appellant did not, in light of the seriousness of the crime for which she was convicted, constitute cruel and unusual punishment, and where a tape recording of a telephone conversation between appellant's son and a law enforcement officer was properly admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant individuals were involved in a motor vehicle accident with a city police vehicle belonging to respondent city and filed timely claims pursuant to Cal.

Code &sect; 945.6(a)(1). Appellants contended that the statutory requirements violated due process and equal protection. The court affirmed and held that the statutory provisions that defined with precision and clarity the respective rights and duties of both the individual claimants and the public entities were not unreasonable, arbitrary, or vague, and thus not subject to constitutional attack on due process grounds. The court further held that the statutory discrimination would not be set aside as a denial of equal protection of the laws if any state of facts reasonably could be conceived to justify it, and there were a number of reasons for the classification including affording the public entity the chance to correct the conditions or practices that gave rise to the claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed and held that the shortened filing requirements of the statute as applied to a public entity were constitutional because they were not unreasonable, arbitrary, or vague, and no equal protection violation existed because they were rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of San Mateo County (California) in favor of defendant insurer, finding that an occupant-exclusion clause in plaintiff's automobile policy was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action seeking to establish the limits of insurance protection under a policy of insurance issued in California by defendant insurance company, solely for liability arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle in Mexico, plaintiff appealed from a summary judgment in favor of defendant. The judgment adjudicated that the occupant-exclusion clause in the policy was valid, and that the liability limits were those provided for in the policy. On appeal, the court noted that, in view of public policy and the provisions of Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 11580.1, a clause excluding coverage to the occupants of a motor vehicle was impermissible and invalid. The court concluded that the provisions of Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 11580.1 were a part of the insurance contract, and that, under the statute, the occupant-exclusion clause was invalid. Pursuant to the statute's provisions, the liability limits were those therein provided, rather than the lesser limits provided for in the policy. The judgment was therefore reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment for defendant insurer was reversed, with directions to the trial court to enter summary judgment in favor of plaintiff, because the automobile insurance policy at issue afforded coverage to plaintiff and minor children involved in the underlying automobile accident, where occupant-exclusion clause in policy was invalid as against public policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution appealed a decision from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which granted defendant's motion to strike the allegation pursuant to Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution charged defendant with two murders pursuant to separate counts that each alleged, as a special circumstance under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(b)(4), the murder of the other victim as well as a murder conviction in a prior proceeding. The trial court granted defendant's motion to strike the prior conviction allegation, reasoning that when &sect; 190.2(b)(4) authorized the death penalty if the defendant had &quot;in this or in any prior proceeding been convicted of more than one offense of murder,&quot; the statute required conviction of more than one murder offense within a single prior proceeding before the prior conviction could constitute a special circumstance. After determining that the prosecution's petition for writ of mandate was an appropriate vehicle for interlocutory challenge to the trial court's decision, the court reversed, refusing to impute to the legislature an intent to create a statutory scheme that precluded charging special circumstances for multiple prior murder convictions unless those convictions were all obtained in a single trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court to strike the special circumstances charge because the court refused to interpret the relevant statute as evidencing a legislative intent to restrict the &quot;multiple murder&quot; special circumstance to situations in which the additional murder convictions had all been obtained in a single criminal proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The car dealer sold a car to the driver, who then was involved in an accident with the car. The driver's passengers sued the dealer, among others, and the dealer settled with them. Subsequently, the dealer filed a complaint against the driver for indemnity, alleging that, by virtue of the settlement the dealer had entered into, the driver was obligated to indemnify the dealer for the amounts it was obligated to pay the plaintiffs in the prior lawsuits. The complaint also alleged that the sole basis of that recovery had been based on the car's design defect and that the dealer's liability was passive or secondary in nature.  It also alleged that the driver had been negligent, attempting to shift liability to the driver. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the action. Although the dealer was seeking reimbursement from the driver on the basis of the doctrine of implied indemnity, the court held that a retailer is strictly liable, regardless of fault, and that to allow indemnification because the driver was actively negligent in driving the automobile was the antithesis of strict liability.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 653f for solicitation of a bribe and from an order that denied her motion, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995, to quash the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant attorney asked a police officer to plant narcotics on a third party and then arrest that party, for which defendant agreed to pay the police officer money. Defendant did not follow through with the scheme. Defendant was convicted of solicitation of a bribe, and she appealed. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for solicitation of a bribe under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 653f as solicitation of a bribe could be stated in any form that carried the import of a bribe which was intended to be so understood. Also, defendant had the requisite intent to solicit when she asked the officer to accept a bribe and use his official capacity as a police officer to effect an arrest. The requirement in &sect; 653f that there be corroborating evidence of the officer's testimony was satisfied by the testimony of another attorney from whom defendant obtained the police officer's name and a tape recording of defendant's soliciting the police officer. Moreover, defendant later withdrawing or failing to consummate the crime was not a defense to the charge. Finally, the denial of defendant's motion to quash the indictment under Cal. Penal Code 995 was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant attorney's conviction for solicitation of a bribe because defendant had requisite intent to bribe when the solicitation of a police officer in his official capacity was made as supported by corroborating testimony of two witnesses. Moreover, the denial of a motion to quash indictment was proper because defendant's privilege against self-incrimination was not violated, and probable cause supported the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner licensees sought review of decisions by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board (California), which reversed three orders of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control suspending on-sale liquor licenses of petitioners for violations of Cal. Code Regs. tit. 4, &sect; 143.3, that met the provisions of Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 22, and Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 24200(a) and (b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner licensees' licenses to sell liquor were suspended by the Department of Alcoholic Beverages Control (Department) because they repeatedly violated Cal. Code Regs. tit. 4, &sect; 143.3 by allowing simulated sex acts in their establishments when serving alcohol. The department determined that the violations were sufficient to establish grounds for suspension or revocation of the licenses pursuant to Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 22, and Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 24200(a) and (b). The court annulled the decisions of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board (Board) that reversed the department's suspensions, finding that there was no conflict between &sect; 143.3 and Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 318.5 and 318.6. The court reasoned that local ordinances adopted pursuant to &sect;&sect; 318.5 and 318.6 were penal in nature and merely permitted cities to proscribe the state of undress of employees in establishments that served food and beverages, and that was distinct from the department's jurisdiction to license and regulate all aspects of alcoholic beverages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ of prohibition and/or mandate to compel respondent judge to disqualify himself under the provisions of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appeared before the judge on a probation revocation hearing and timely filed a court-provided form entitled &quot;Declaration of Prejudice (170.6 C.C.P.),&quot; which substantially complied with the provisions of &sect; 170.6. The judge denied his motion for an order reassigning the case to another judge, claiming that no facts were stated in the motion and because &sect; 170.6, as applied to that criminal proceeding, was unconstitutional. Petitioner then sought a writ to compel his case to be transferred to another judge. The court issued a writ of mandate to grant petitioner's motion. It held that the judge's contention that the declaration should state facts was unmeritorious, as proof of facts showing actual prejudice was not required and, to the contrary, the right to disqualify a judge was automatic in the sense that a good faith belief in the judge's prejudice alone was sufficient. Further, when the affidavit was timely and properly made, immediate disqualification was mandatory and the court was bound to accept proper affidavits without further inquiry.

The trial court required counsel to testify to facts supporting his conclusion. The trial court denied the motion. After a subsequent trial, defendant was convicted on both counts. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court held that the motion to transfer should have been granted. The court ruled that a defendant's right to a transfer was automatic insofar as a good faith belief in a trial court's prejudice was the only requisite.

Defendant's conviction was affirmed because &sect; 496(2), (3) the rebuttal presumption, that defendant's failure to make reasonable inquiry proved knowledge that the property was stolen, did not eliminate prosecution's burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the property was stolen and that the circumstances of receiving the property warranted defendant making a reasonable inquiry. Further, the particular instruction to the jury clearly expressed the reasonable doubt standard and any affirmative defense provided for by &sect; 496(3). Moreover where no fundamental right or suspect classification was involved, equal protection was not violated by a categorization that required those, who handled easily fenced goods, to make inquiry of the goods' title and origin if the circumstances of receipt were suspicious.</SPAN></P>

The trial court enjoined appellants from enforcing the regulations to the extent that they resulted in the exclusion of needy natural parents, residing with their eligible children, from the budget unit used to compute grants for Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Appellants sought review. The court affirmed because the classification of different living styles so that a family with deprived children received a lower grant solely because the parents were unmarried violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and conflicted with Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 11250.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent religious/educational association brought an action for refund of franchise taxes it paid after appellant, the California Franchise Tax Board, revoked respondent's tax exemption pursuant to Cal.

The trial court ruled that &sect; 23704.5 was unconstitutional. The court agreed on appeal, finding that &sect; 23704.5 created an arbitrary and capricious classification singling out religious/educational organizations that operated laundry facilities from other nonprofits and other types of business, and denied respondent equal protection of the law because other categories of exempt nonprofit organizations were not similarly precluded from engaging in profit-making commercial ventures. The court found that any competitive advantage from the franchise tax exemption for nonprofit organizations had been corrected by the adoption of an unrelated business income tax, and that the purpose for enactment of &sect; 23704.5, backed by a laundry and linen supply association, was suspect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners sought review of a decision by the Superior Court of El Dorado County (California), which granted defendant state's demurrer in response to plaintiffs' cross-complaint for inverse condemnation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners brought a cross-complaint against defendant state for inverse condemnation of plaintiffs' septic tanks and cesspools. The trial court sustained defendant's general demurrer without leave to amend on the grounds that no cause of action had been stated for the reason that direction to comply with Cal. Water Code &sect; 13951 was a valid exercise of defendant's police power. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of dismissal. The court held that police power was one of the most essential powers of government and one that was least limitable. Thus, even though plaintiffs' cesspools and septic tanks might not be a nuisance per se, it was still within the police power to declare them a nuisance for regulatory purposes. The court held that Cal. Water Code &sect; 13950 was not arbitrary as applied, even though in defendant's cross-complaint there was no claim that plaintiffs' existing waste disposal systems constituted a nuisance in fact. The court reasoned that &sect; 13950 expressly declared the disposal systems to be a nuisance; hence, no such claim was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of plaintiff property owners' cross-complaint against defendant state for inverse condemnation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the order of the Superior Court of Placer County (California), which revoked his probation under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.2a, after he was convicted and confined for violating Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11377. Defendant signed a waiver of his right to appear at the revocation hearing. Defendant was represented by the public defender. Defendant also appealed his guilty plea in the &sect; 11377 conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty, was given probation, and then had his probation revoked after waiving his right to be present at the hearing. On appeal, the court consolidated defendant's appeals, reversed the probation revocation order, and affirmed defendant's conviction for possession of barbiturates, Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11377. The court held that the revocation order was void. Defendant's waiver was not authorized by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.2a, because the trial court's jurisdiction to revoke defendant's probation expired 30 days after the court was notified that defendant had been convicted and confined for a second offense. Also, the waiver did not purport to waive the 30-day time period. The court heard defendant's appeal from his guilty plea notwithstanding defendant's failure to seek a certificate of probable cause as required by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1237.5, because the trial judge effectively certified the case for appeal when he directed the transcript to be prepared. The court found that a subsequent revocation of probation was a &quot;collateral&quot; rather than a &quot;direct&quot; consequence of the guilty plea, and defendant need not be advised of such consequences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the probation revocation order. Waiver was not authorized, the trial court's jurisdiction to revoke defendant's probation based on a subsequent conviction had expired, and defendant did not waive the 30-day time period. Defendant's conviction of possession of barbiturates was affirmed. Defendant understood that the prior conviction increased his sentence and did not have to be told about collateral consequences of his plea.</SPAN></P>

At the end of an academic year petitioner was not invited to return. Petitioner followed a grievance and appeal procedure and was ultimately invited to return. Petitioner claimed that he was due pay for the period he was not working. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court and determined that petitioner was not eligible for pay for the period of time he did not work. The court found that this was not a wrongful dismissal case, but merely a decision not to renew petitioner's annual appointment. The court ruled that it was not required that probationary academic employees who were notified that they would not be rehired, and who thereafter were in fact rehired, be paid for the interim period during which they did not work.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the justice court of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23102(a). The superior court reversed defendant's conviction because it found Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23126&nbsp;unconstitutional. On further appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that there was a rational connection between the blood alcohol level at the time of defendant's arrest and the taking of the blood alcohol test, even with an absence of a time limit between the two events. The rebuttable presumption that defendant was inebriated with a blood alcohol level of .10 percent did not make the statute unconstitutional because defendant could have introduced evidence that he was not inebriated and the state was still required to prove its burden beyond a reasonable doubt. Also, the objective determination of inebriation was a more satisfactory means to prove inebriation rather than subjective observations. Pursuant to court precedent on other statutes which created a presumption, &sect; 23102 was not unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. V because defendant had the duty to explain the blood alcohol level.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff hotels filed an action to enjoin defendant district attorney from enforcing against them the provisions of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17564, which prohibited certain room rate advertising. The lower court granted the permanent injunction after determining that &sect; 17564 applied to motels and not hotels, and therefore was an invalid exercise of police power and violated the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court affirmed the injunction, noting that it must defer to the lower court's discretion in determining that an injunction was necessary and holding that the issuance of the Attorney General's opinion was not a change in circumstance sufficient to justify the dissolution of the injunction. The court looked to the plain meaning of the applicable Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code statutes and determined that hotels did not fall within the classification of &sect; 17564. Consequently, the legislature was discriminating against motels by limiting their ability to advertise when they were similarly situated to hotels. Accordingly, the statute was held to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying defendant district attorney's motion to dissolve the permanent injunction, holding that, because the statute prohibiting room rate outside advertising by motels differentiated between hotel and motel advertisement in an unreasonable manner, it violated the Equal Protection Clause and was, therefore, not enforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a mass arraignment in respondent court, defendant pled guilty to driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The docket sheet showed that defendant was advised of all of his rights. The reporter's transcript indicated that the trial judge, when defendant's attempted to plead guilty without benefit of counsel, reiterated advice regarding defendant's right to counsel. A few months later, defendant was charged with a second violation of the same statute, and his probation was revoked. Defendant sought a writ of prohibition and mandamus seeking to have the prior conviction declared unconstitutional because he was not properly advised of his right to have counsel appointed if he could not afford counsel. The superior court denied the writ. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that facts did not support defendant's contention. The court noted that defendant did not allege that he was indigent at the time of trial. The court found that the reporter's transcript indicated that, when defendant appeared before the court a deputy public defender was present with him, the court twice asked defendant if he desired an attorney and only then accepted the plea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of the writ, rejecting defendant's argument that the conviction was unconstitutional because he was not advised of his right to appointed counsel if he could not afford one. The court held that the docket sheet showed that defendant was properly advised his rights, the record reflected that respondent court specifically advised defendant of his right to counsel, and there was no proof that defendant was indigent.</SPAN></P>

Respondent franchise tax board filed an unverified petition for writ of mandate and for a temporary restraining order, and the superior court filed a writ directing respondent municipal court to vacate its order and entered an order prohibiting the return of funds during the pendency of proceedings. Affirming the judgment, the court held that the petition was proper because the failure to verify was cured by amendment, the order was proper because it was a stay order and not subject to the limitations applicable to temporary restraining orders, and the writ was proper because respondent municipal court lacked power to order return of the funds. The court found that respondent franchise tax board's remedy by appeal was inadequate and further proceedings by respondent municipal court were not required.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court submitted the cause for original jurisdiction by the superior court, which issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing respondent to print residential rehabilitation bonds as required under petitioner's bond resolution. Such bonds were deemed under the Marks-Foran Residential Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 37910 et seq., not to constitute a debt or liability of the local agency and the bond resolution contained similar provisions. The city's program merely encouraged owners of property in the areas to be rehabilitated to repair and improve their own properties. Neither the Act nor the bond resolution adopted pursuant thereto violated Cal. Const. art XIII, &sect; 25, which prohibited the giving or lending of public monies to private persons.

Defendant had been determined unfit to be treated as a juvenile under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 707and was tried as an adult.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile court found defendant unfit to be handled as a juvenile, and he was tried and convicted as an adult of first degree murder, first degree robbery, first degree burglary, felony joy riding, and second degree burglary and sentenced to life in prison. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court, with modification to sentences, holding that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 707 was not unconstitutionally vague and finding no err in defendant's unfitness to be treated within the juvenile court system. Defendant's behavior pattern, the nature and circumstances of the crimes allegedly committed, his past record, and the degree of sophistication as related to criminal activities were properly considered. The court rejected the argument that improper treatment by juvenile authorities contributed to defendant's conduct. While a finding of unfitness was not appealable, it was reviewable by writ and by appeal from a criminal conviction. Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 1235 did not deny defendant his right to be confronted with the witnesses against him under U.S. Const. amend. VI.

The court ruled that the legislature could constitutionally permit application of the exemption to property acquired after the March 1st lien date, and no specification of how the funds, which would have been paid in taxes, would be used was necessary to save the statute from attack.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant councilmen who were recalled in an election and replaced by newly elected councilmen attempted to file nomination papers to regain their offices, but the city clerk refused to accept them on the ground that Cal.

However, the court held that &sect; 27521 was unconstitutional under the strict scrutiny test for violation of fundamental freedoms because &sect; 27521 was not necessary to promote a governmental interest. The court ruled that the state's interest in the stability of municipal government may not be promoted by measures directly aimed at curbing debate on issues of public importance, no matter how divisive they may be.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant natural father sought review of a decree of adoption of the Superior Court, San Mateo County (California) by which his two sons were adopted by respondent stepfather.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant natural father sought review of a decree of adoption, granted despite his opposition, by which his two sons were adopted by respondent stepfather. The trial court had found that appellant's consent was not required under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 224 because of his failure to pay child support, as ordered under a prior decree of dissolution, for more than one year. Such prior decree also had awarded custody to the mother. He urged that &sect; 224 was unconstitutional, under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, as it denied equal protection to parents by providing different standards for loss of parental rights. The court affirmed the adoption decree as &sect; 224 did not unconstitutionally discriminate against appellant where he had not met his obligation of support and the children had an urgent need for an alternative provision as by the adoption. Thus, the court found that &sect; 224 was in accord with the interests of the children and furthered the state's compelling interest in making adoptions possible in such cases, and also found the determination, that appellant's failure to provide support, was willful and without lawful excuse, and supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decree of adoption, whereby respondent stepfather adopted appellant natural father's sons without his consent, was affirmed where the statute, under which the adoption was permitted, did not unconstitutionally discriminate against appellant as he had failed to pay child support, ordered under a prior decree of dissolution, for over a year, and the statute comported with the interests of the boys who urgently needed alternative provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery with intentional great bodily injury and assault with force likely to do great bodily harm. He appealed the judgment of conviction, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his confession under Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 1014, which held a patient's confidential communications with a psychotherapist to be privileged. In affirming defendant's conviction, the appellate court concluded that this privileged was qualified by Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 1024, which indicated that no privileged existed if the psychotherapist believed that the patient was a danger to another and if communication was necessary to prevent the threatened harm. Where defendant's psychotherapist had reason to believe that defendant posed a danger to another and that disclosure was necessary to prevent such harm, defendant held no privilege under Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 1014, and the trial court properly denied his suppression motion. In modifying the judgment, however, the appellate court concluded that because the offenses were an indivisible transaction incidental to one objective, the robbery of his victim, defendant could be punished only for one offense.</SPAN></P>

They appealed the judgments, contending the sentences of imprisonment for five years to life with ineligibility for parole for three years constituted cruel or unusual punishment within the meaning of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The court affirmed the judgments, applying a three-prong test that included the nature of the crime and the criminals, the degree of danger presented to society, and a comparison of the punishment with punishments for other crimes in the same jurisdiction. The court held that the nature of the crime was a serious and deadly offense against society. The court noted that the constitution did not require perfect symmetry between the various acts defined as crimes and the corresponding punishments assigned. The court further held that appellants' punishment, while not totally reconcilable with the punishment for every other crime, fell within the permissible range of punishment for similar serious and dangerous crimes. The sentence was not so disproportionate to the crime that it shocked the conscience and offended fundamental notions of human dignity.</SPAN></P>

To determine if defendant guarantors were engaged in business, the trial court was to find whether they were engaged generally in the business of guaranteeing for a consideration the debts of others, and if so, any liability incurred as a result was a debt arising out of the conduct of such business.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was directed to pull off the road for a secondary inspection at Temecula checkpoint located 70 miles north of the United States-Mexican border. When border patrol performed a routine immigration inspection, marijuana was found under a sleeping bag, and defendant was subsequently convicted of possession of marijuana for sale and of transportation of marijuana. On appeal, defendant argued that the search was unconstitutional because this was a permanent checkpoint, and the discovery of marijuana was unlawful. The court affirmed and held that similar convictions were consistently and repeatedly upheld based upon evidence seized during searches made at fixed checkpoints. The court held that the authority for the constitutionality of permanent checkpoints had long been established and that in balancing U.S. Const. amend. IV right of the individual against the constitutional mandate to secure the nation internally from aliens, and the permanent checkpoint activity of the border patrol satisfied the constitutional test of reasonableness.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury found him guilty of taking his employer's calves, defendant sought review of his conviction by the Superior Court of Sonoma County (California) for grand theft in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 487(3). Defendant contested the lack of the court's advice on the self-incrimination privilege, the failure of giving the jury a lesser-included offense instruction, ineffective assistance of counsel, and the constitutionality of &sect; 487(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after his employer's two newborn calves were discovered in his shed. After waiving his Miranda rights, defendant signed a written confession. Defendant was convicted of grand theft in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 487(3). On appeal, the court held that because defendant was represented by counsel, the trial court had no obligation to advise him of his privilege against self-incrimination before he took the stand. Defendant claimed that he was denied effective assistance of counsel based on the failure to challenge the admission of his Miranda waiver and signed confession. Noting that the defense theory was the lack of intent by defendant to permanently deprive his employer of his property, the court found that allowing the statement's admission was a reasonable tactic to support defendant's posture that he had nothing to hide. Because &sect; 487(c) defined the taking of calves as grand theft without regard to value, the court held that a lesser- included instruction on petty larceny was properly refused. Finding no merit to the constitutional challenge of &sect; 487(c), the court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction on grand theft for stealing his employer's calves. The court held that the trial court did not have to advise on the self-incrimination privilege, that strategy rather than ineffective assistance could explain counsel not objecting to the confession being admitted, and that a lesser-included instruction was precluded by the statutory definition of the offense, which survived a constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, inmates charged with murder, conspiracy, and assault with a deadly weapon, moved to quash the indictment pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995, on the ground that the grand jury that returned the indictment was improperly chosen. The trial court granted the motion, and the state appealed. The court reversed, holding that defendants failed to show purposeful discrimination by any of the five superior court judges who were the selectors of the panel, nor was there any inference of discrimination. The judges, in soliciting names for the grand jury, sought to obtain a fair cross-section of the community, including old and young, male and female, black and white, rich and poor, and those with a knowledge of each section of the county. Blacks constituted 6.7 percent of the panel of 30, where only 2.4 percent of the population of the county was black. Defendants, at most, showed that a statistical imbalance in this one grand jury by which one small racial group, one age group, and one earning group were underrepresented in proportion to the total population of the county, but the mere fact of inequality in the number selected did not in itself show discrimination.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court order, holding that appellant made no showing that &sect; 6471, either on its face or as applied, prohibited anything other than purely commercial distribution of literature. As such, the ordinance was a valid exercise of the municipality's police power and did not trample on U.S. Const. amend. I rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to possession of heroin, in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11350, after her motions to quash a search warrant and to suppress evidence were denied. Defendant was placed on probation on the condition that she serve one year in jail. Defendant sought review, and argued that the affidavit alleged no information from which the magistrate could reasonably infer that the suspect was keeping drugs at her apartment, the information was stale, and the officers unduly delayed executing the warrant. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that the inference that the suspect was storing contraband at the apartment listed in defendant's name was not so unreasonable as to invalidate the warrant. The 12-day delay in obtaining the warrant was on the fringe of unreasonableness; however, absent abuse of discretion, the question was primarily for the issuing magistrate. The eight-day delay in executing the warrant was not unreasonable because defendant, who had the burden of proving the invalidity of the search, failed to show that there had been a change in circumstances relating to probable cause between the issuance and the execution of the warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for possession of heroin was affirmed. Probable cause supported the inference that the suspect was storing drugs at defendant's home, and there was no abuse of discretion in finding that the information furnished to the magistrate was not stale. Although the warrant was not executed until eight days after it was issued, defendant failed to show that there had been a change in circumstances relating to probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Superior Court of Placer County (California) convicting him of receiving stolen property under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 496. Defendant contended that the refusal to subpoena certain witnesses violated his rights, he was not afforded adequate time to prepare for trial on the amended information, his attorney was incompetent, &sect; 496 was unconstitutional, and the sentence imposed was unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 496 after he had been arrested for receiving property stolen for him by two children who accompanied him to the store. He appealed, arguing the court erred in refusing to subpoena the children, he had insufficient time to prepare after the information was amended from &quot;receipt&quot; to &quot;possession&quot; of stolen property, his attorney was incompetent, &sect; 496 was unconstitutional, and his sentence was cruel and unusual punishment. The court affirmed the conviction. Defendant had a right to present witnesses, but the defendant had access to another witness that was not a child, namely, himself. The record showed the children would have perjured themselves had they testified. The amendment to the information was inconsequential, and defendant further waived the issue by not complaining at trial. Section 496 was upheld as not violating the separation of powers doctrine because the district attorney had discretion by law and under the statute. Finally, the sentence was appropriate because defendant used children to steal, a practice the court found abhorrent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction, holding defendant's rights were not violated by the absence of child witnesses who might not have helped his case. Further, he had adequate time to prepare for trial, and his attorney was effective although he made tactical decisions with which defendant disagreed. The sentence imposed was appropriate for someone who used children to steal for him.</SPAN></P>

The court held that no rule prevented a policeman from following a vehicle on a public highway for any reason, and no unreasonable search or unconstitutional violation of privacy was involved. When the police observed the changing of seats in the moving vehicle, probable cause arose for the detention or arrest of the drivers for reckless driving under Cal. Veh.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner illegitimate child was found to be the decedent's child in a paternity action. When the decedent died, respondent, wife of decedent, admitted his will to probate.

Petitioner was not given notice of the will's admission, and he filed a motion to set aside the probate court's order.

Petitioner's claim that &sect; 255 violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Cal. Const. art. I &sect;&sect; 11, 21 failed because the statute was a reasonable state law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of unlawful administration of a restricted dangerous drug and sentenced to prison.

The court held that the recipient of an injection was not a participant in the criminal act of administering, and that instructions concerning the necessity of corroboration of her testimony as an accomplice was not required. The court held that evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant was admissible because appellant's motion to suppress was untimely and the affidavit in support of the warrant furnished internal guarantees of its reliability. The court found that the trial court's grant of immunity to a witness, limited to specific times and criminal acts, did not deprive appellant of his confrontation rights. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying probation because there was no showing of bias and the probation officer's recommendation was not binding.

Code &sect; 27000 et seq., was approved by the voters to preserve the coastal zone. Plaintiffs, associations and unions, challenged the act as unconstitutional. The trial court found the act to be constitutional, and the court affirmed on appeal. The court held that the state need not afford property owners notice and a hearing prior to enacting an interim permit system to control land use which threatened harm to the state's resources pending development of a comprehensive plan. The plan imposed no restriction on land use, because the conservation commission created by the act was only empowered to adopt a plan for submission to the legislature. The act was not an invalid state intrusion into municipal affairs under Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5(a), because the state was not precluded from regulating land use when necessary to further the state's interest. Moreover, the act did not interfere with the right to travel because it was not discriminatory, it imposed no residence requirement, and it exacted no penalty for exercising the right. Finally, the act did not violate fundamental rights of minority groups.</SPAN></P>

The trial court upheld the ordinance and denied the refunds, except for a portion resulting from a retroactive application.

The court held that the ordinance provided a standard by which to judge whether food was &quot;take-out&quot; and that the term was sufficiently clear and unambiguous. The court held that the separate classification of take-out food businesses was not discriminatory or a subterfuge for eliminating take-out businesses from the community. The court found that the classification had a natural basis and was reasonably related to the intent to generate sufficient revenue to cover removal of litter attributable to the take-out businesses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff political candidates petitioned for a writ of mandate requiring defendant, registrar of voters, to accept plaintiffs' declarations of candidacy for the office of county central committee with the loyalty oath stricken therefrom. Defendant had refused to accept the declarations because they were not substantially in the form prescribed by Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 6491 with the oaths deleted. The trial court granted the writ, ordering defendant to accept the declarations as amended, finding the oath violative of U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV where it required plaintiffs to state &quot;I am not knowingly a member of any organization engaged in such an attempt (to overthrow the government).&quot; The trial court refused to allow defendant to change or sever the language of the oath, as it would involve &quot;legislating&quot; on the part of the court. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that the trial court was under no duty nor did it abuse any discretionary authority by failing to allow defendant to alter the oath, as the entire oath was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding no error in the trial court's failure to add curative language to the oath or to construe it to say something that it obviously did not. Moreover, the court concluded that not only was the second part of the oath unconstitutional, but the entire oath was fatally infirm because of its vagueness and its susceptibility of being applied to both lawful and unlawful activities alike.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant designated beneficiary brought suit to recover death benefits payable through respondent retirement system and against respondent surviving spouse as a result of decedent's death before his retirement. The retirement board determined that because decedent was still married at the time of his death, respondent surviving spouse and not appellant was entitled to death benefits. Upon review, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of respondent surviving spouse from which decision appellant sought relief. Appellant argued that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 31780, in effect at the time she was named beneficiary, entitled her to a lump sum death benefit as the named beneficiary. Section 31780, later amended, provided death benefits should be payable to a surviving spouse. The court reversed the decision of the trial court and held that under the circumstances, to apply either section of the code defeated decedent's right to designate his beneficiary without giving him any new comparable advantage and constituted an unreasonable impairment of a vested contractual right between decedent and respondent contrary to U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10, and Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant convalescent hospital desired a sewer hookup for its facility.

The court affirmed the decision of the lower court that dismissed the action, in favor of respondent district. The court reasoned that because a specific provision, such as Ordinance 11, governed a general one, such as &sect; 5471, Ordinance 11 provided the proper measure of the connection fee. Additionally, the court noted that respondent obtained its powers from the Vallejo Sanitation and Flood Control District Act, 1952 Cal. Stat. ch. 17, p. 351, codified at Cal. Water Code ch. 67 app., and not from &sect; 5471.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12021, possession by a felon of a firearm capable of concealment upon the person. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute and argued that the trial court committed error in overruling his objection to the state's cross-examination as to his earlier possession of the same gun here involved. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the constitutionality of &sect; 12021 had been established in a 1925 case and nothing in modern developments in application of the equal rights provision and the due process requirement had vitiated the rationale underlying the prior case. The court stated that the strong governmental interest in minimizing the danger to public safety arising from the free access to firearms that could be used for crimes of violence clearly outweighed the almost frivolous &quot;burden&quot; suffered by a convicted felon denied the &quot;right&quot; to carry a concealable weapon. The court also rejected defendant's arguments regarding cross-examination, finding that the state's questions were directly relevant to defendant's blanket denial on direct of having the gun at any other time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) of grand theft-person in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 486 and 487 (2) and his sentence to state prison, contending that the imposition of a state prison term for the taking of property of a value of less than $ 200 from the person of another violated U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of grand theft-person in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 486, 487 (2) and sentenced to state prison. He appealed his conviction on the basis of proportionality and bias of the sentencing judge. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the imposition of a state prison term for the taking of property of a value of less than $ 200 from the person of another did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII or the Cal. Const. proscription against cruel and unusual punishment. The court noted that, where the theft was from the person, the possibility of violence and harm to the victim was greatly increased and observed that California's maximum sentence for theft from the person was not grossly out of proportion with sentences for a similar crime in other jurisdictions. The court likewise rejected defendant's argument that the sentencing judge was biased because he considered defendant's failure to appear for sentencing as well as his patently false explanation for not appearing in determining an appropriate punishment. The court ruled that both were proper items of consideration in determining the sentence as they bore upon defendant's receptivity to rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, holding that defendant's sentence was not unconstitutionally disproportionate to his crime. The court noted that California's maximum sentence for theft from the person is not grossly out of proportion with sentences for a similar crime in other jurisdictions. The court rejected defendant's argument that the sentencing judge was biased because that argument was not supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner pest control operator was disciplined by respondent board which suspended his license for 60 days because of 2 dozen violations that involved services at 6 different residences. Some of the violations were failure to report conditions or to recommend corrective measures, with some of these violations considered to be grossly negligent acts. The trial court denied petitioner's writ of mandate to overturn respondent board's suspension, and the court affirmed the denial of the writ. The court found overwhelming evidence to support respondent's findings and further found that the statutes and regulations regarding structural pest control operations were not void for vagueness. The court found that gross negligence was a question of fact properly left to respondent's determination, and that petitioner's belated compliance with the contracted services was not a defense to the violations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order of the Superior Court of Monterey County (California), which placed him on probation for offenses violating Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was placed on probation after being found guilty of several offenses violating the California Penal Code. During trial, defendant claimed that the trial court erred by admitting evidence obtained through an illegal search. Defendant also claimed that the trial court erred when it did not grant his motion for a mistrial. Defendant made the motion for mistrial after the court commented on the disappearance of the recordings pertaining to defendant's guilt. Defendant felt that such comments, though well intentioned, were of such a nature that the jury was prejudiced to the point that they would not be able to render a fair and just verdict. On appeal, the court affirmed the order of probation. The court held that the use of the recordings, and their subsequent disappearance in court, did not in any substantial way impinge upon defendant's right to a fair trial. The court believed that, after an examination of the entire cause and the evidence, it was not reasonably probable that a result more favorable to defendant would have been reached in the absence of the complained of error.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the lower court's judgment of conviction. The court reasoned that the phrase &quot;without proper care and attention,&quot; might by itself have conveyed little certainty of meaning but that read in the context of the entire section and its clear legislative purpose, the language was not so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily have guessed as to its meaning and differed as to its application.

The latter section carries a lesser maximum sentence than section 12021.

The court held that where the prior conviction of a felony made criminal what was noncriminal in one not a felon, the minimum sentence may not be increased because of an indispensable prior conviction.

The court found that the trial court had properly found contempt for: advising his client to disobey an order of the court, misconduct during voir dire, referring to his client by his first name and making reference to his friendship with his client, stating that the defendant was stripped of his presumption of innocence by the press with the help of the sheriff's office, humiliating a witness, repeating questions after an objection had been sustained, stating to the jury that the prosecutor had a reasonable doubt as to the defendant's guilt, improperly impeaching a witness, displaying an offensive personality, and failing to yield respectfully to the rulings of the court. The court found that the evidence did not support direct contempt findings for comments made by petitioner during his opening statement. The court granted habeas corpus relief in part; finding that petitioner should be dismissed from custody based on the judgments for contempt that were reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the trial court's judgment of contempt on all but two of the incidents. The court annulled the finding of contempt based on petitioner's statements during his opening argument, and the court granted petitioner's writ of habeas in part.</SPAN></P>

Appellants, the surviving passenger and the heirs of the two deceased passengers, filed an action against respondent, the estate of the driver of the automobile. The trial court denied appellants relief. During the pendency of the appeal, the California Supreme Court rendered its decision in the case of Brown v. Merlo, 506 P.2d 212 (Cal. 1973), which declared the provisions of the automobile guest statute,&nbsp;Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 17158, unconstitutional. In reversing the trial court's judgment, the court held that the Brown case applied retroactively to appellants' action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied petitioner chaplain a writ of mandate and rendered judgment in favor of respondent California State Personnel Board, upholding the validity of a male-only certification for a youth rehabilitation facility. Petitioner appealed on the basis of sex discrimination in employment. At issue was whether the male-only certification violated Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 18. The court held that the male-only qualification in no way prohibited petitioner from pursuing the occupation of minister or chaplain. It merely prevented petitioner from pursuing that occupation at the facility in question. There was no conflict with art. XX, &sect; 18. The court reviewed the action of respondent by applying the strict scrutiny standard and, at the same time, according to respondent a proper presumption of validity of its administrative action. The court concluded that respondent had demonstrated a compelling state interest in restricting the job of chaplain at the facility to men and not women. The position came within the bona fide occupational qualification exception of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000e-2(e). The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of a writ of mandate on the grounds that the male-only certification was within the bona fide occupational qualification exception of the Civil Rights Act. The interests of the public and those of the inmates were so overwhelming compared to those of petitioner chaplain and members of her class so as to constitute a compelling state interest in male-only certification, thus satisfying equal protection standards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After petitioner doctor was convicted of possession of marijuana, disciplinary proceedings were commenced before respondent board. At the time, marijuana was classified as a narcotic under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11001 (1970). Respondent found that use of a narcotic was per se unprofessional conduct under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 2384 and 2390 (1970), which made a physician's personal use of narcotics and a narcotic conviction itself misconduct. On writ of mandate, the superior court ordered respondent to set-aside the revocation and remanded the case for further proceedings. Both parties appealed. In reversing in part and remanding with directions to issue a peremptory writ compelling respondent to vacate its order and dismiss the proceeding, the court noted that &sect; 11001 had been amended to eliminate marijuana as a narcotic and ruled that petitioner was entitled to the benefit of that amendment. The legislature could constitutionally provide for disciplining of physicians on the basis of personal use of narcotics, due to the physician's role in controlling dangerous drugs, but because marijuana had been declassified, its use was no longer per se misconduct.</SPAN></P>

Knowledge of the contraband character of the items sold was reasonably inferred from the evidence without retrying the prior. Moreover, defendant never challenged his identity as the one who had suffered the prior conviction. Therefore, defendant's objection under Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 352 should have been sustained.

The court granted petitioner's request for a writ of prohibition. The court held that under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 200, the father had no present custodial rights in the child as against petitioner. The court found that, while father was entitled to notice and hearing of any attempt to award custody to a nonparent under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4600, his right to notice did not preclude petitioner from initiating proceedings to place the child for adoption. Significantly, the court found the father presented an unsympathetic claim for custody of the child. He previously did not have custody and took no steps to support or legitimate the child. Further, the father did not intend to take personal custody of the child or assume personal responsibility for the child's support. The court found no reason to delay adoption proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged in an information with conspiring to violate Cal.

The charge of violating &sect; 261.5 had been dismissed following a preliminary hearing by the magistrate, who found that the state failed to show that the requisite intent was present. As defendants had been committed to the trial court on the remaining charges, the district attorney repleaded the &sect; 261.5 charge in the information, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 739. The trial court set aside the information under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995. As there was no factual dispute to have been resolved and the issue was one of law, the dismissed charge could have been pleaded in an information without the necessity of a new preliminary examination. The magistrate's dismissal of the &sect; 261.5 count was based not on any evidentiary deficiency or the resolution of any factual dispute, but on an erroneous application of the law. Therefore, the charge of a violation of &sect; 261.5 was not vulnerable to a motion under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review from the Superior Court of San Mateo County (California), where he was admitted to probation following his conviction, by plea of guilty, to possession of cocaine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had drugs imported to him and the package was intercepted by authorities. Appellant pled guilty to possession of cocaine and was put on probation. Appellant sought review and claimed that an affidavit contained insufficient facts from which a magistrate could have determined the reliability of the information, and that the original search of the parcel, transmitted as first class mail, was illegal because there was nothing to show that the opening agent had a real suspicion that the parcel contained contraband, or that it was opened by an agent authorized to do so. On review, the court found that the customs officers were authorized by law and regulation to open the package in question and determine its contents. The court determined that the information was not illegally acquired and there was no entrapment. Also, neither the filing of the charge nor the ruling of the trial court constituted an improper act which would invalidate the plea to another count. The order admitting appellant to probation was therefore affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order admitting appellant to probation following his guilty plea to possession of cocaine was affirmed because there were no reversible irregularities regarding the search and seizure of the contraband linked to appellant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant recipients received general assistance from respondent county. Respondent calculated the amount of appellants' grants based upon a three-person household, although one of the recipients was unrelated to appellants. Appellants sought declaratory relief through a writ of mandate precluding respondent from computing the grants based upon unrelated recipients and required respondent to calculate the grants based upon need. The trial court denied appellants' writ and dismissed their complaint. Appellants challenged the judgment contending respondent's calculation scheme denied appellants of their due process rights by making improper presumptions, the ordinance discriminated against a class of recipients living together, as well as violated appellants' right to free association. The court affirmed the trial court's determination, however, modified the judgment, holding in respondent's favor. The court held the trial court improperly dismissed appellants' action without first deciding the merits of the case. The court reasoned the applicable ordinance simply set forth a classification scheme, was not discriminatory and did not deprive appellants of any of their rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant farm workers sued respondent farm labor contractors after they were discharged from employment and were not rehired.

Thus, appellants sought to enjoin respondents from unfair competition. The trial court sustained respondents' demurrer to appellants' complaint on the basis that &sect; 2805 was unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney filed a petition for habeas corpus relief from the trial court (California), seeking annulment of two incidents of charged contempt, for each of which he was fined and sentenced to five days in the county jail, with the sentences to run consecutively.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney was representing a defendant in nationally publicized murder trial.

The court held that petitioner's remarks, although ill-chosen, did not obstruct the administration of justice during the trial and did not insult and directly impugn the integrity of the lower court. Furthermore, the court found that the lower court's order failed to demonstrate with sufficient particularity that petitioner's conduct constituted legal contempt. In addition, the court found that petitioner's comments, referring to penalty during closing argument, were insufficient to find petitioner guilty of contempt where the lower court failed to specifically find that petitioner understood that any reference to the greatest possible punishment had been proscribed by the lower court's ruling.

Penal Code &sect; 1203.2a, by failing to seasonably act on his demand for hearing, and that an eight-month delay in revocation proceedings deprived him of due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was on probation for three years for an earlier conviction, he was arrested and sentenced to prison for grand theft and forgery. Before defendant's second conviction, his probation officer had filed a request for revocation and the court had issued a warrant to show cause. While in prison, defendant directed a letter to the probation department in which he recited the subsequent convictions and sentence and, referring to the warrant lodged against him for probation violation, demanded a court hearing within 60 days or dismissal. The court held a hearing and revoked defendant's probation and defendant appealed, contending the trial court lost jurisdiction to impose his sentence and denied him due process by the delay in scheduling the hearing. The court affirmed and held that the defendant had not complied with Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.2a because his letter was neither directed to, nor delivered to, the district attorney, nor was it signed in the presence of the warden and attested. The trial court's hearing schedule had met due process standards and no evidence of prejudice was presented by the defendant that would have warranted reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the revocation of defendant's probation because he had not complied with the strict requirements under the statute for demanding a sentencing hearing. The record had not supported an inference that the delay was purposeful or oppressive or deliberately obstructive. Defendant had presented no evidence to refute or mitigate the charge, nor did he claim his ability to defend had been impaired by delay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged in respondent trial court with soliciting another to engage in lewd and dissolute conduct. The court issued an alternative writ of mandate directing respondent to have sustained petitioner's demurrer to the complaint or to show cause why it had not done so. The trial court chose the latter. Three questions were presented for consideration. Were the words lewd or dissolute conduct unconstitutionally vague? Had Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647(a) contravened the U.S. Const. amend. I guarantee of freedom of speech? If constitutional fault was absent, what meaning was to be given to the words lewd or dissolute conduct in order that it could be determined what was lawful? There was no authority that held that the terms obscene and obscenity, as used in criminal statutes, were unconstitutionally vague or uncertain. U.S. Const. amend. I did not prevent the state from declaring to it to be criminal to commit an obscene act. The words lewd or dissolute conduct were found to have been that sort of sexual conduct which was grossly repugnant and patently offensive to generally accepted notions of what was appropriate and decent according to community standards.</SPAN></P>

The court found neither constitutional nor other fault with the statute making obscene conduct criminal.

The trial court dissolved a temporary restraining order and respondents were free to sell the vehicle. On appeal, the court held that it was essential to plaintiff's case that the action complained of be considered state action. Plaintiff had to show a level of significant state involvement sufficient to characterize the repossession as state conduct. Upon consideration of the evidence, the court found no state action.

On review, the court affirmed summary judgment in favor of respondents and held that the statute was unconstitutional for two reasons. First, Congress in enacting the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 as amended in 1965, had expressed its judgment to have uniform federal regulations in matters affecting employment of aliens and nonimmigrants, thus barring state action in this field.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendants seeking a declaration that a provision of a group insurance policy issued to defendants was void on constitutional grounds. The policy provided reimbursement for medical expenses incurred by covered state employees, but excluded reimbursement for chiropractic treatment. Specifically, the policy excluded coverage for physical therapy unless such was provided by a medical doctor. Plaintiff asserted this provision, Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 10176.2, authorized the state to discriminate against the chiropractic profession in the field of physical therapy. The trial court dismissed plaintiff's complaint, holding plaintiff's action did not constitute a cause of action, and plaintiff appealed. The court held &sect; 10176.2 constituted a legislative determination that a limited alternative to the total exclusion of coverage for physical therapy should be permitted in medical insurance policies, and that such was in the public interest to do so. Therefore, the subject matter, where it dealt with economic and social problems, was one wherein courts had to bow to legislative experience and deference to legislative judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff buyer submitted an offer to buy agricultural property from defendant seller. Plaintiff, however, failed to raise the cash payment by the due date and escrow instructions were approved in writing by plaintiff. Defendant recorded notices of default and an election to sell the trust property. Plaintiff filed an action seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction, restraining defendant from proceeding with foreclosure of the property. The trial court dissolved plaintiff's temporary restraining order and denied its motion for a preliminary injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court stated that the original contract between the parties terminated when plaintiff failed to raise the cash payment and that the true agreement was by the escrow. The court held that plaintiff failed to establish its right to injunctive relief because there was no allegation that plaintiff approved the escrow instructions by reason of duress and neither were its rights prejudiced by the one minute differential between the recording of the substitution and the notice of default.

After a hearing, respondent court refused to hold real party in contempt on the ground that the spousal support obligations in the agreement were contractual and were therefore not enforceable by contempt. Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari for review of respondent's decision. On appeal, the court held that a 1967 amendment to Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 139 made child and spousal support payments law-imposed obligations that could be enforced by contempt proceedings, even though such support was provided for in an integrated agreement. Further, the court found that the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt related to run-of-the-mill debtor-creditor relationships and that alimony, child support, and marital property settlements were not within the constitutional protection. The court noted that the requirement that the court find the obligor had the ability to pay and willfully refused served to protect the debtor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The people sought review of that portion of an order of the Superior Court of Marin County (California) that credited petitioner on his California prison terms with the time that he had spent in custody in Alabama while resisting extradition to California.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">California's Adult Authority suspended petitioner's parole from prison. Petitioner was apprehended and placed in jail in Alabama because of his suspended parole. Petitioner successfully resisted extradition before he was returned to California. The Adult Authority allowed petitioner no credit on his terms of imprisonment. On his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, it was ordered that petitioner be credited on his California prison terms with the time that he had spent in custody in Alabama. The people appealed from that portion of the order. The court reversed. Applying Cal. Penal Code &sect; 3064, which provided that from revocation of parole until a return to custody, the individual was deemed a fugitive, the court determined that petitioner was not entitled to credit for time served in Alabama. The language in &sect; 3064, limiting credit for time served after a &quot;return to custody,&quot; indicated that a parolee had to have been in California authorities' control before time served may be credited against his California sentence. Despite the fact that petitioner was held in Alabama solely on the California parole suspension, the court ruled that California had no actual control over him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that portion of the order that credited petitioner with Alabama jail time served by him while resisting extradition. Although the Alabama jail time was served only because of the Adult Authority's order suspending his parole, service of that time had to have been deemed incidental to California's unsuccessful efforts to return him to prison. It could not have been deemed his &quot;return to custody&quot; of the California authorities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent was an employee of the State of California when he was killed in an automobile accident in November 1971. Decedent had married defendant wife some two months before his death. Before that decedent lived with plaintiff mother for over ten years. In January 1963, decedent had designated his mother as beneficiary of his death benefits payable through his employment. In 1970 Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 21205 was enacted, which automatically revoked a previous beneficiary of the death benefits after a member's marriage or other life event. The decedent had not made a new written designation of a beneficiary to his benefits, and the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant wife, finding that the benefits were payable to her. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the benefit became automatically payable to defendant wife under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 21211. The court held that the automatic revocation of section 21205 did not unconstitutionally impair the parties' contractual rights, because it bore a material relation to the theory of the pension system and its successful operation.</SPAN></P>

After taking evidence in a consolidated hearing of the motions of defendant, the trial court denied the motions to quash the indictment and pronounced judgment committing defendant to state prison with credit for time theretofore served. Defendant appealed the judgment arguing that the order denying the motion to quash the indictment was not supported by substantial evidence. The reviewing court affirmed the judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, following his successful completion of probation, appealed a lower court's decision upholding the trial court's refusal to seal his conviction for misdemeanor possession of marijuana. The court reversed, ordering defendant's conviction sealed. In so ordering, the court agreed with defendant's equal protection challenge, wherein it was noted that a minor like defendant convicted of a non-drug misdemeanor was permitted to have the record of that conviction sealed if it was a first offense and probation was successfully completed, but those convicted of drug misdemeanors were not eligible. Although recognizing that the government had a compelling interest in enforcement of its laws, the court found no rational grounds for distinguishing non-violent drug misdemeanants from other offenders. The distinction violated defendant's equal protection rights, with the remedy being to place defendant in the class of persons eligible for sealing. Accordingly, the court ordered defendant's record of conviction sealed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile challenged his delinquency adjudication for arson, contending that his adjudication was improperly obtained since it was based upon the uncorroborated testimony of two accomplices. The court rejected his contention, and affirmed his adjudication. It held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1111's requirement of corroborating evidence of an accomplice's testimony did not apply to juvenile proceedings, and that inapplicability did not violate appellant's equal protection rights. Corroboration was not a requirement of due process, but was instead an additional safeguard for adult trials added by the state legislature. Since appellant's delinquency proceedings were fundamentally fair, the fact that he was not granted a special safeguard provided to adults was immaterial. Juvenile defendants also received certain protections that adult defendants did not receive. There was, therefore, no constitutional infirmity in appellant's delinquency adjudication, and it was accordingly affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's delinquency adjudication was affirmed. The mere fact that it was based upon uncorroborated accomplice testimony was of no moment, since there was no constitutional requirement that accomplice testimony be corroborated. The requirement in adult trials of corroboration was based upon a statute, which did not apply to juvenile proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged by information with possession of marijuana and with driving under the influence of the combined influence of liquor and a drug.

The trial court accepted the district attorney's opinion that appellant was ineligible to be considered for diversion and sentenced him to probation. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, holding the trial court properly denied the motion to suppress. The court reversed the sentencing order, holding that appellant was not ineligible for diversion simply because he was also being charged with driving under the influence of the combined influence of liquor and a drug and that he was therefore entitled to resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c12">3&nbsp;On count I (presenting a false claim) defendant was placed on probation for one year and &quot;imposition of judgment and sentence&quot; was accordingly suspended.  Conditions of probation were that &quot;defendant be confined to the Sacramento County Jail for a period of three (3) months and . . . comply with all rules and regulations&quot; thereof and &quot;conduct himself in a proper manner&quot; while in confinement.  On count II (perjury) he was sentenced to the state prison for the term prescribed by law.  It does not appear from the clerk's transcript that there was a pronouncement of judgment.  However, execution of the prison sentence was suspended for one year and defendant was placed on probation subject to the conditions that he was to be confined in the county jail for one year and, again, conform to jail rules and regulations and be of good conduct while in confinement.  The probationary jail terms were made concurrent.  The clerk's minutes and the order of probation do not specify that the term of probation on this count was also one (1) year but it is implied that the term of probation is coterminous with the suspension of execution of sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c12">These orders were made on August 22, 1973.  Probation will expire within the next six weeks.  In the remote event of a revocation of probation, if defendant is returned to court for further proceedings, a problem of double punishment would arise.  At argument, the Attorney General conceded that there was a single criminal objective in defendant's course of conduct.  In these circumstances, although both sections 72 and 118 of the Penal Code were violated by that conduct, defendant may be punished for only one violation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of presenting a fraudulent claim in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 72 and of perjury, a violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 118 in connection with the filing of a claim for the California homeowner's property tax exemption for his residence. Defendant signed a statement to the effect that no one with whom he shared ownership of the home had received governmental assistance over the prior 12 months. In fact, defendant's wife had been receiving assistance. At trial, the issue was whether defendant knew that his wife had an ownership interest in the property; defendant claimed he lacked such knowledge. After the jury returned a verdict of guilty, defendant appealed. The court ruled that the substance of a special instruction that defendant maintained should have been given to the jury by the court, sua sponte, was adequately covered in other instructions. Further, the court held that defendant was not a party who could challenge the constitutionality of the homeowner's tax exemption statute, because he was charged under a general statute,&nbsp;&sect; 72, and was thus precluded from attacking the validity of the statute through which he had sought benefit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the superior court's order of probation, because the trial court had not erred in failing to give a special instruction to the jury, the defendant could not attack the constitutionality of the homeowner's property tax exemption statute, and the judgment was otherwise proper.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court reversed the decision holding that appellant's discharge, which resulted in his inability to fulfill the five-year service requirement, could not destroy his right to benefits.

As for the revocation hearing, the court held that it was incumbent on petitioner parolee to demonstrate that the timing was unreasonable or that he was prejudiced by the delay. Because the decision as to the need for counsel in cases where a request for counsel was made at a prerevocation or revocation hearing was within the sound discretion of the authorities who administered the parole system, there was no requirement that petitioner be appointed counsel, even where he withdrew his waiver of counsel the same day.

Appellant challenged the validity of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 24074, which attempted to grant priority rights to a certain class of private creditors of a license holder. The court held that the statute was invalid insofar as it conflicted with 11 U.S.C.S. &sect; 104. Further, as to the claimed security interest of a respondent who sold his liquor store and liquor license to the debtors, respondent maintained that 11 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11(a)(21), divested the trustee from the powers which he was attempting to assert because respondent was appointed escrow holder some ten months prior to the sellers' filing in bankruptcy. The court held that 11 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11(a)(21) did not pertain, because respondent did not fall within the scope of its provisions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant metal platers filed a declaratory judgment action against respondent city, seeking a declaration that appellants were entitled to be taxed under Los Angeles, Cal., Mun.

The lower court granted judgment for respondent, and, on appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that appellants were not wholesalers any more than painters would be because appellants' work was predominately a service function and the furnishing of materials was incidental to its application. The court found that the taxpayer classification was not unconstitutional because there was a reasonable basis for distinguishing between, and classifying in different classes, businesses which were primarily engaged in manufacturing and selling or selling tangible personal property at wholesale on the one hand, and businesses which were primarily engaged in supplying a service on the other hand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The staff membership of plaintiff physician at various hospitals was removed after plaintiff allegedly insulted a local member of a national medical society. Plaintiff sued the local medical society, the hospitals that removed his membership, various doctors, and other medical-related service providers, alleging that defendants joined together to tortiously interfere with his right to practice medicine. After deadlocked jury was discharged, the lower court entered directed verdict for defendants on several counts pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 630. On appeal, the court found the lower court had erred in failing to advise the jury that an existing staff member was entitled to have his dismissal considered as required by hospital bylaws, and to a hearing even though the bylaws did not so provide. The power of a nonprofit hospital to pass on staff membership issues was a fiduciary power exercised for the public good, and a physician applying for membership was entitled to minimal due process. Failure of the lower court to instruct on plaintiff's right to a hearing, and the duty of the hospitals to follow their duly instituted procedures, was prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was represented by an experienced public defender, participated in the plea bargaining, and accepted the sentence which was part of that plea bargain, without objecting to the commissioner's participation.

Appellant sought review and alleged that &sect; 232(c)'s term of &quot;habitually intemperate&quot; was vague and therefore void, and therefore, the statute could not be made constitutionally definite by judicial construction. The court affirmed the lower court's ruling and held that the term &quot;habitually intemperate&quot; was not so vague as to deprive appellant due process of law because the separate words were simple words with simple meanings and the controlling statute's purpose was to protect children.</SPAN></P>

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect;11530, alleging issuance of the warrant violated Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 1525- 1526 and that &sect;&sect; 1525-1526 were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's residence was searched pursuant to telephonic warrant granted during a three-way conversation with an officer, the prosecutor, and a municipal court judge, during which the officer made oral statements to the judge and the judge authorized the officer to sign the judge's name on the telephonic warrant. The officer issued a warrant on which he printed the judge's name but signed his own name. The officer's statement was transcribed thereafter. The search yielded marijuana and other contraband. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence and defendant was convicted for possession of marijuana in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect;11530. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and held the telephonic search warrant was proper under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 1525- 1526 because there was no requirement that the officer's statement be transcribed before the warrant was issued; the statutes were not unconstitutional because neither the U.S. Const. amend. IV nor Cal. Const. art.

Penal Code &sect; 13521. The trial court sustained defendants' demurrers with leave to amend, and upon plaintiff's failure to amend within the time allowed, the court entered a judgment of dismissal in favor of defendants. On appeal, plaintiff argued the penalty assessment was an illegal and unconstitutional overcharge in violation of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, which prohibited excessive bail. The appellate court found that defendants had charged the fees under a statute that was constitutional at the time the fees were assessed. The fact that the statute was subsequently found unconstitutional did not create a basis for plaintiff's claim. Defendants' reliance upon the statute was in accord with the understanding of the law prevailing at the time, and that understanding controlled the rights of the parties. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In defendant's trial for first degree murder, the trial court denied his motion to discover the identity of the state's forensic evidence experts. The court reversed and held that the trial court denied him information that would have been valuable to him in cross-examining and impeaching the state's witnesses and arguing that the state had not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that defendant could be prosecuted again for first degree murder, but he could not receive the death penalty on retrial because he did not receive it in the first trial. The court also held that jurors who would never impose the death penalty could not be excluded from the guilt phase of the trial on retrial. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to quash the indictment, which he made on the grounds that the grand jury selection process excluded certain sections of society and thereby deprived him of equal protection and due process. At the time defendant offered the motion, he was required to show standing in order to assert a claim of class exclusion from grand jury service and he could not show that he was a member of the allegedly excluded groups.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent insurance commissioner, after a hearing, denied petitioner's application for a life and disability insurance agent license on the basis that petitioner was not of good business reputation pursuant to the Cal.

Among other allegation of misconduct, petitioner had a pending indictment in another state. Petitioner argued &sect; 1668(d) was unconstitutional because the standard of using an applicant's reputation was not rationally connected to the fitness of the applicant to act as an insurance agent. The court affirmed the decision of the lower court which denied petitioner's writ of mandamus. The court determined that the standard used in &sect; 1668(d) was not one of merely reputation but business reputation. The more definite standard bore a rational relationship to the inquiry of a person's competency to engage in the business of selling insurance. The quality described was ascertainable, and the existence of a good business reputation was a fact capable of being determined.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no &quot;taking&quot; or &quot;damaging&quot; of appellants' property and that they were not entitled to inverse condemnation relief. The court also held that Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, aircraft restorer and owner, were restoring an airplane. Prior to licensing, defendant aircraft restorer took plaintiff widow's husband up in the plane, which crashed and killed plaintiff's husband. The trial court granted a nonsuit in plaintiff's wrongful death action based upon the airplane guest statute,&nbsp;Cal. Pub. Util. Code &sect; 21406, which provided that, except for intoxication or willful misconduct, an airman was not liable for injuries to nonpaying guests. The court held that the justifications for the statute, the protection of hospitality and the elimination of collusive lawsuits, were not rational grounds for the differential treatment between paying and nonpaying guests. The statute violated the equal protection guarantees of the state and federal constitutions. The judgment was reversed as to defendant aircraft restorer, because taking up plaintiff's husband in the absence of the required licensing, which violated Cal. Pub. Util. Code &sect; 21411, created a rebuttable presumption of failure to exercise due care. The judgment was affirmed as to defendant owner because there was no evidence that he was aware that defendant aircraft restorer would take a guest up.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant seller sold its property to appellant developer to build low-income apartments financed by the federal government.

Appellant developer obtained its financing and applied for a building permit, but before the permit was issued respondent city enacted an emergency ordinance imposing a moratorium on building permits and dwelling-unit. The trial court held that enactment of the moratorium ordinances was proper and that appellants were not entitled to the relief sought because appellant developer had not satisfied all conditions for issuance of a building permit prior to the time respondent enacted its moratorium ordinances and appellants had not exhausted their administrative remedies by applying to respondent for a variance from the rezoning ordinance. The court reversed the lower court and held that the possibility of relief from a general policy did not exist because of the unusual circumstances and thus, appellants were not required to pursue futile administrative remedies in order to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant street artists challenged a judgment in favor of respondent police department and the dissolving of a preliminary injunction by the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California). Appellants contended that a city ordinance which forbid unlicensed peddling on the sidewalks violated their rights under U.S. Const. amend. I, and was an unconstitutional grant of unlimited discretion to respondents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant street artists sought declaratory and injunctive relief in the trial court to obtain permits to sell their wares on city streets. Respondent police department exercised its discretion to deny such permits under San Francisco, Cal., Police Code &sect; 869, the Charter of the City and County of San Francisco, Cal., &sect; 3.537, and the Municipal Code of the City of San Francisco, Cal., &sect; 26. The trial court ordered judgment for respondents and dissolved a preliminary injunction. Appellants challenged the ordinances as violating their rights under U.S. Const. amend. I, and as unconstitutional grants of unlimited discretion. The court affirmed. It upheld the trial court's finding that U.S. Const. amend. I rights were not involved. Appellants had no vested right to conduct private business on public streets. The court held that the power delegated to respondents was constitutional, and there was a presumption that they acted properly. Finally, the court noted that declaratory relief was not appropriate for judicial review of administrative actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. It held that the First Amendment rights of appellant street artists were not violated by city ordinances which granted respondent police department the discretion to deny them peddlers' permits to sell their wares on city streets. It held that street peddling did not involve First Amendment rights, and that respondents had properly exercised the constitutional right to police the streets.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the 90 day compulsory maternity leave violated plaintiff's due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because the restriction was irrational and arbitrary. The court held that the 90 day notification policy was constitutional because it facilitated administrative planning. Because the court was unable to sever the unconstitutional portion of defendant's policy from the constitutional part, the court held that the plaintiff's due process rights were violated and that she was entitled to reinstatement.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 6384, 6094 and 6202. The court held that under the Buck Act , 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 105 et seq., the state had the constitutional power to impose sales and use taxes on contractors for work performed at the federal facilities involved in the case within state statutory limits, with the same effect as though such area was not a federal area, because Congress had expressly consented to such tax and thereby waived federal sovereign immunity. The court reversed the portions of the judgment appealed from and concluded that plaintiff's tangible personal property was used in construction of improvements of real property in the state and was subject to taxation under &sect; 6384, and that the trial court erroneously exempted the property under &sect; 6381 by characterizing it as machinery or equipment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of Butte County (California), which held that the formula used by defendant in assessing plaintiff corporation's timberlands was illegal and directed that a new hearing be conducted by defendant's Assessment Appeals Board. Plaintiff cross-appealed from the portion of the judgment that ordered a complete rehearing on its application for a reduction of the assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant county assessed taxes against plaintiff corporation's timberlands according to the capitalized income approach, instead of the more common comparative sales approach, plaintiff brought an action to recover excess tax payments. Defendant appealed the trial court's judgment that the capitalized income approach formula was illegal, and plaintiff cross-appealed the order for a new hearing by defendant's Assessment Appeals Board. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant's capitalized income tax assessment formula was unconstitutional, because it contemplated not only the economic factor of existing mature trees, but also the value of immature growing timber, which was exempt from taxation under Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 12 3/4. Additionally, the court found that, when the uncontested value of taxable mature trees was added to the value previously determined for the bare land, a double taxation resulted, which was expressly forbidden by Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 102. Further, the court found that a new hearing was required in order to determine a more appropriate and proper method of valuation by defendant to conform to constitutional requirements.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed. The court rejected defendants' contentions based upon the nonestablishment clause of U.S. Const. amend. I because it was not uncommon that the original source of the ideas expressed was so remote that subject awareness of the source was absent and the opinion expressed seemed to be endemic in the public consciousness, and so it was with legislation that had a religious derivation. The court held that defendants did not have standing to assert the constitutional rights of married couples or consenting adults acting in private because they were neither married nor acting in private. The court held that the practice of oral copulation in a public place was not yet declared to be a fundamental right under U.S. Const. amend. IX.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which convicted him of sale of heroin, Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested as a result of his illegal activities. During the arrest of appellant, heroin was found under the floor mat of his car. The police officers, fearing that evidence at appellant's home would be destroyed, decided to go to his home. When the officers arrived they knocked on the door, and believing the women inside were trying to destroy evidence, the officers gained entry to the home and discovered drugs inside. The officers then stayed in the home until a search warrant was obtained. Once it was obtained they searched appellant's home and discovered contraband. Appellant was charged and convicted. Appellant sought review of the decision alleging that the search was illegal. The court affirmed, holding that the officer's intrusion into appellant's home was no greater than that otherwise permissible, the fact that its purpose was in part to prevent the destruction of evidence while a warrant was obtained did not render it constitutionally defective. The court ruled that under the totality of the circumstances, there was probable cause to arrest appellant. The court held the lower court did not err in denying appellant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the lower court did not err in denying appellant's motion to suppress evidence disclosed in the search.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff's claim was that the salary had become so inadequate as the result of inflation that it economically discriminated against electors who have families to support and, in effect, imposed a property qualification for holding that public office. The trial court dismissed the action after sustaining defendant city's demurrer without leave to amend. The court affirmed. The court accepted as true plaintiff's allegations that the salary allowed did in fact discriminate against electors who were heads of families. The court stated that it nevertheless had to affirm the judgment of dismissal because the complaint raised no justiciable issue because the power to fix salaries had been reserved to the electorate under Cal.

The court held that no court had the power to fashion a remedy which would compel the electorate to amend the charter so as to provide for an increase in pay in order to eliminate the alleged economic discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner reporter obtained information from attorneys in a high profile criminal case who were subject to an order not to release for public dissemination information regarding testimony to be offered in the trial. After the trial ended, the trial court ordered petitioner to disclose the identities of the individuals who had released the information to him. Petitioner refused to comply and was found in contempt. Petitioner sought review in state and federal courts, but the contempt judgment was not disturbed. Petitioner then filed for habeas corpus relief, claiming, among other things, that the judgment ordering his incarceration until he complied with the court order violated the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The court denied petitioner's request for habeas corpus relief, finding that none of his allegations stated grounds for relief, but stayed the execution of the order so that petitioner could seek a determination from the lower court that there was no substantial likelihood that his further incarceration pursuant to the contempt judgment would accomplish its intended purpose of coercing him to disclose the information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant teacher was convicted of engaging in an act of prostitution on the basis of unconstitutionally obtained evidence. Plaintiff, the governing board of a school district, admitted that evidence at the trial of defendant's dismissal proceeding. Defendant alleged, on appeal, that his objection on constitutional grounds to the evidence should have been sustained, that his conduct was not immoral, and that it did not show unfitness to serve further as a teacher. The court concluded that whether the exclusionary rule could be applied to the dismissal proceeding was dependent on the purpose of the statute authorizing dismissal. The court held that even though a dismissal proceeding was punitive in nature, the primary purpose was to protect defendant's students and other children who viewed defendant as an example. Accordingly, the court held that the exclusionary rule did not apply to the dismissal proceeding of defendant and affirmed the judgment of the lower court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of robbery in the first degree pursuant to Cal. Pen. Code &sect; 211, and was found to have used a firearm during the liquor store robbery within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.5. He appealed his conviction and his enhanced sentence. The court affirmed the judgment. As to appellant's contention that the enhanced sentence was cruel and unusual, the court held that appellant was not, as he contended, serving two consecutive life sentences, but rather one sentence of ten years to life. The court found this sentence to be within the legislature's broad discretion to specify punishment for crime. The court held that the imposition of the additional penalty of five years for the use of a firearm during the crime was not an unreasonable classification that denied appellant equal protection of the laws; it was clearly constitutional. The court held that the trial court committed no error by admitting into evidence a mug shot taken of appellant from a prior arrest. The appellant had admitted that he had been in jail before, so further evidence of criminal conduct was not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction because allowing a photograph of appellant to be admitted into evidence was not prejudicial, and the enhancement of appellant's sentence due to the use of a firearm during the robbery was neither cruel and unusual nor an unreasonable classification that denied appellant equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 11351.5 required cohabiting unrelated adult males (UAM) to make financial contributions, in amounts equal to the cost of an independent living arrangement, to families with whom they lived that received aid under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Act (AFDC). Plaintiffs, aid recipients and cohabiting UAMs, challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The court affirmed the lower court's denial of a writ of mandate and injunctive relief against defendant welfare department's enforcement of &sect; 11351.5. The court held that &sect; 11351.5 did not violate due process or equal protection mandates, as &sect; 11351.5 was reasonably related to the task of preventing the diversion of AFDC benefits from children to the UAMs and the fact that it dealt only with unrelated males rather than females was also reasonably related to the state's goal. The court also held that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.

Intervenor sought a lien against any settlement between plaintiff and defendants in the amount intervenor paid to plaintiff as workmen's compensation benefits pursuant to Cal. Lab. Code &sect;&sect; 3850-3864.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff commenced this action to recover damages for personal injuries he sustained when he was struck by an automobile negligently operated by defendants. Defendants alleged that plaintiff was acting in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the accident, and that any judgment recovered by plaintiff should be reduced by the amount of payments made to him by workmen's compensation. Pursuant to Cal. Lab. Code &sect;&sect; 3850-3864, intervenor filed a notice of lien in the action claiming that any settlement or judgment recovered by plaintiff was subject to a first lien for workmen's compensation benefits. It was stipulated that plaintiff settled his claim against defendants without intervenor's consent. The trial court entered a judgment of nonsuit on the complaint in intervention in favor of defendants since no evidence was presented as to defendants' negligence. The court determined that Cal. Lab. Code &sect;&sect; 3859-3860 required the employer to bring an action against the third-party tortfeasor. The court affirmed the trial court ruling, and held that a judgment of nonsuit on the complaint in intervention was proper since no evidence of defendants' negligence was established.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, and held that the statute as amended provided that plaintiff may settle his claim against a third-party tortfeasor without the consent of his employer. Plaintiff's settlement was not subject to any lien based upon the employer's claim for reimbursement of compensation payments, since intervenor failed to assert a claim by way of an action against the third party.</SPAN></P>

The court found that it was the joinder of the powers allegedly conferred by &sect; 6313 with the criminal provisions of &sect; 6315 that created the constitutional problem. Such joinder rendered the application of &sect; 6315 to an order or recommendation made under &sect; 6313&nbsp;unconstitutional, as being violative of due process of law because there was no provision that required a hearing, and there was no provision for notice of their content to the affected person after they were made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner recipient of aid to the totally disabled required and received an attendant care grant. After he married a recipient, the county pursuant to state regulation reduced petitioner's attendant care grant. The fair hearing decision adopted by the Director of the State Department of Social Welfare (Director) found the county had correctly applied the regulation. Petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandate and declaratory relief seeking to have his attendant care grant increased and a retroactive award of benefits. The court ruled in favor of petitioner and granted the writ. The Director appealed and the court affirmed. The court rejected the argument that retroactive payments should not be awarded in the absence of a showing that services were performed and indebtedness therefor was created. The court also rejected the argument that there was a fundamental distinction between basic subsistence aid and services. Simply because an attendant care grant was restricted as to its purpose did not make it any less subject to the rule of retroactivity. The fact that petitioner survived without assistance did not wipe out the right to assistance that was vested at the time of need.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought a writ of habeas corpus review of the sentence imposed by the trial court for defendant's violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11531, sale of marijuana. Defendant claimed that the sentence of five years to life was cruel and unusual and disproportionate to the crime in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The court denied defendant's writ because the penalty was not out of proportion even though it was harsh and severe. The court held that marijuana was a dangerous drug, as the evidence seemed clear that use of marijuana could have the effect of aggravating or precipitating an underlying psychosis and could trigger amotivational syndrome. Comparison of the penalty of life imprisonment to other crimes with the same sentence demonstrated that the other crimes were typically more serious. The court held, however, that the danger in the use of marijuana and the greater availability of marijuana in states that border Mexico made the more severe penalty levied on the persons responsible for the problem reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff department of public works filed a complaint for an injunction to compel the removal of defendant corporation's billboard. The trial court entered summary judgment declaring that the billboard was unlawfully placed and was being unlawfully maintained in violation of the Outdoor Advertising Act (Act), Cal. Bus &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 5200 et seq., and ordering defendant to cease maintaining the billboard and to remove it. Defendant appealed. The court rejected the argument that there was triable issue on whether the non-complying billboard was in fact a nuisance. The fact that the billboard failed to comport to the Act rendered it a nuisance as a matter of law because the Act defined non-complying billboards as such. A legislatively declared public nuisance constituted a nuisance per se against which an injunction could issue without allegation or proof of irreparable injury. The court rejected the argument that the compelled removal constituted an unconstitutional taking. Regulations regarding restrictions upon the use of property in an exercise of the police power for an authorized purpose did not constitute a taking without just compensation. Defendant's other contention failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of plaintiff public works.

Petitioners sought a writ of habeas corpus to quash the conviction. They contended that the county ordinance violated Cal. Const. art.

County-owned property, such as the bridge, was not part of the public lands of the state, and the constitutional right to fish did not protect those fishing from county owned property. The county could exercise its police power to protect and preserve the safety and welfare of both pedestrians and persons traveling over the bridge. The conviction of petitioners was therefore appropriate, and their petition was denied.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the pretrial ruling with respect to the lineup was reviewable on appeal after his guilty plea by analogy with Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5(m) because pretrial motions to suppress were recognized as a proper means of challenging the fairness of a lineup. The court affirmed and held that even though the challenge to the lineup was heard at a special pretrial motion, it was not a motion under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5 because that section only applied to evidence sought to be suppressed as the product of a search and seizure. The court found that section 1538.5(m), which allowed an appeal after a guilty plea, was not applicable to other kinds of pretrial rulings, thus the fairness of the lineup became immaterial after defendant pleaded guilty and the trial court's decision was not reviewable on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 264 was constitutional and the fact that the jury chose to convict appellant of USI instead of forcible rape was attributed to the mercy and leniency of the jury.

The court denied petitioner's request for a writ of mandate. The court held that petitioners' claim regarding the even-numbered districts, which were scheduled to hold elections two years later than the odd-numbered districts, was moot because the case was resolved after the first set of elections. The court held that the time limits for redistricting were directory rather than mandatory because there was no provision for their enforcement. The court held that there was no evidence of an unconstitutional dilution of petitioners' voting strength but merely a showing that the redistricting plan had failed to make the most of petitioners' potential political power. The court found that the record indicated the opposite of an attempt to dilute Chicano voting strength. The court held that the considerations of incumbency were legally neutral.

Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions, the jury was incorrectly instructed, and the order granting probation was constitutionally defective. The court held that the techniques defendant employed in his business transactions, even though separate and distinct one from another, were sufficiently similar in nature to show corroboration. The crimes had progressed to the point that it was reasonable to infer that they would have been completed except for the intervention of the arrests, which were sufficient to establish an attempt. The court found that the jury instructions were sufficiently complete to enable the jury to resolve the issues presented to it for decision. The court further held that defendant could be compelled to give up a fundamental or constitutional right as a condition to the granting of probation. In depriving defendant from engaging in the furnace or heating business as a condition of probation, the trial court did not abuse its discretion. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant supplier filed suit against respondent customer for breach of contract and attached its bank account. The attachment was released on the filing of a bond. The trial court entered a judgment to which the parties had stipulated, and granted respondent's motion to dissolve the attachment and to exonerate the bond. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the order that dissolved the attachment and exonerated the bond. The court also awarded attorney's fees to appellant for prosecuting its appeal. The court found that respondent's election to have the bond exonerated concurrently with its motion to dissolve the attachment estopped it from denying that the order was an order to dissolve an attachment. The court also concluded that the three year limit for enforcing an attachment was inapplicable because the only time limit on the current case was a promise to pay appellant the judgment up to a set amount if it prevailed. The court further reasoned that the original attachment as applied to the case was unconstitutional, and that had respondent made its motions prior to judgment the order to dissolve the attachment and exonerate the bond would have been valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant debtor sought declaratory and injunctive relief from respondent judgment creditor's garnishment of her wages. Debtor claimed that the garnishment of her wages deprived her of property without due process of law arguing that the judgment only declared the amount of money she owed not how the judgment was to be satisfied. The trial court denied the preliminary injunction. The court affirmed the denial of the preliminary injunction and found that the statutory scheme of the wage garnishment laws, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 690.6, were constitutional. The court found that due process required an opportunity for a hearing, which appellant received in the trial court, before the deprivation of property occurred. The court found that appellant was entitled to an exemption if she could not provide for her necessities, but that it was not an arbitrary deprivation and did not impinge on appellant's constitutionally protected rights to require her to apply for and prove the exemption because it was a matter of legislative choice to have appellant prove her need for the garnished wages than to make appellees disprove appellant's need for it.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed because the requirement did not impair the right to vote on the basis of sex since it was not an unreasonable condition for registration. It determined that the purpose of the requirement was to disclose whether an applicant had previously been registered under another name and the requirement was not a denial of equal protection because women changed their names when they married, but a man did not. The court held that certainty of identification of prospective voters was a legitimate concern of the legislature and that this was a reasonable attempt to identify voters. It held that even if compliance with the requirement resulted in disclosure of marital status, such compliance was not onerous or burdensome and a woman was not disadvantaged by disclosure because there was nothing private about the status of marriage.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, in separate hearings, negotiated plea bargains in each case and had the matters set for a probation hearing.

Defendant filed separate declarations of prejudice under Cal. Civ. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was a duly licensed insurance company that executed surety bonds guaranteeing the payment of use and sales taxes due from those persons primarily liable for the taxes.

The court found that the constitutional requirement of notice was satisfied by notice to the taxpayer of the delinquency. Duplicate notice to the surety was constitutionally unnecessary. Plaintiff also argued that a taxing system that imposed penalties was unreasonable, since it punished the surety rather than the actual wrongdoer, the defaulting taxpayer. The court found that the bonding requirement was a reasonable method of securing payment of revenue to the state. The penalty provisions were aimed to insure payment of taxes and not punish taxpayers or their sureties, who were not compelled to write bonds, but did so for remuneration.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the driver claimed that the Department was unauthorized to suspend his driving privileges under Cal. Veh.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department had administrative sanctions that it had to impose. Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 13352(c) allowed a trial court to order that privileges not be suspended under &sect; 13352 where a licensee was being convicted for the first time. In this case, the trial court recommended no suspension after striking the driver's prior conviction without first determining its validity. The Department suspended his privileges anyway, and he sued. The superior court held for the Department. On appeal, the court affirmed. The mere striking of the prior conviction was not the equivalent of a finding that there was no prior conviction. The trial court first had to find that the conviction was constitutionally invalid before it could order no suspension. To permit the trial court to strike a prior conviction that it had not found to be invalid and order no suspension violated legislative intent by allowing the trial court to decide whether to impose suspension on a second conviction under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23102. Also, Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 13352 did not violate the separation of powers because it did not simply give the Department discretion over the imposition of suspensions but required them in specific cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction for violating Cal. Penal Code &sect; 311.2 for exhibiting an alleged obscene film. The appellate department of the superior court, on its own motion, certified the issue of whether the municipal court erred in its jury instructions as to the standard of obscenity. The court affirmed appellant's conviction, holding that a recent United State Supreme Court opinion did not hold Cal. Penal Code &sect; 311&nbsp;unconstitutional, but rather left it to the states to see if their statutes measured up to the new requirements. Except for the requirement in &sect; 311 that obscene matter had to be &quot;utterly without redeeming social importance,&quot; &sect; 311 had been previously construed substantially in accordance with requirements, and the jury was so instructed. Courts could not read the &quot;utterly without redeeming social importance&quot; element of the offense out of &sect; 311 because to do so would be to invade the province of the legislature by redefining the elements of the underlying crime, which violates the separation of powers principles. The trial court properly instructed the jury that evidence of community standards was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant board reorganized recreation and park districts under the District Reorganization Act of 1965 (act), Cal.

Plaintiffs attacked the reorganization, alleging improper procedure. The superior court held in favor of defendants, and, on appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, rejecting plaintiffs' constitutional argument that it was denied the right to vote on the annexation.  Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 56438 permitted reorganization without an election because sufficient written protests were not filed. The court found that plaintiffs waived a defect in the legal description. Plaintiffs' territory could be detached and annexed to defendant district without plaintiffs' consent because Cal. Gov't. Code 56004 was inapplicable to a major reorganization in light of other relevant provisions of the act. Defendant board was properly designated the conducting district. Because a recreation and park district was a district of limited powers, plaintiffs were not entitled to mailed notice of board proceedings. Plaintiffs failed to plead estoppel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an obscenity case, appellants sought review of a decision requiring the return of respondent's motion picture projectors, which had been seized pursuant to search warrants. The city attorney, as counsel for appellant real party in interest, cited the rule that evidence of a crime was subject to seizure. It was theoretically possible that, in a prosecution under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 311.2, the prosecutor could offer in evidence of the distribution of obscenity a film projector, as corroboration of the officer's testimony that he saw the offending films projected on a screen. But, while possible, appellants had made no contention that respondent's projectors were seized for that purpose. The judgment of the lower court recognized that the seizure of the projectors were not necessary or proper evidence of the commission of a crime. Therefore, the sole purpose of the seizure must have been to stop an illegal practice. The use of a search warrant for this purpose, in advance of an on-the-merits determination of guilt, was improper as a violation of due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower court was affirmed because, although respondent's seized projectors could have been used in the commission of a misdemeanor, they were designed for and capable of use for lawful purposes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, minors and their guardians, were denied benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependant children (AFDC) program, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 601-610 and Cal.

State Dept. of Social Welfare and Eligibility Assistance Standard Reg. 41-450.12 (regulation) issued by respondent Director of the Department of Social Welfare of the State of California. The regulation limited AFDC benefits to situations of continued absence, which excluded children whose parents maintained a home together although they had deserted the child. The trial court denied relief to plaintiffs challenging the regulation. On appeal, the court reversed because the regulation was void and unconstitutional. The court held that the provision of the regulation that continued absence did not exist, within the meaning of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 11250, when both parents maintained a home together but the child lived elsewhere, was void because it arbitrarily and unreasonably created a classification of children, who were similarly situated with other children who received aid, contrary to the equal protection clause of U.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee, having been discharged from his job and having been denied unemployment insurance by the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, sought a writ of mandate to compel an order for payment. Unemployment benefits were denied based on Cal. Unemp. Ins. Code &sect; 1256.1. The writ was denied by the Superior Court of Alameda County (California). Appellant challenged the denial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee was cited for driving a vehicle without an operator's license. He was sentenced to pay a fine or to serve seven days in jail. He was unable to pay the fine and spent a week in jail. The company knew where he was, so his termination on the basis of involuntary absence was unavailable. The decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board that denied benefits was based on Cal. Unemp. Ins. Code &sect; 1256.1, which provided that absence from work because of incarceration, if one was convicted, constituted leaving work voluntarily without good cause. However, compulsion to serve a sentence, which was imposed only in lieu of a fine, which could not have been paid because of indigence, constituted an invidious discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The Board, an administrative agency, could not have declared the sentence unconstitutional, but it had the jurisdiction to hold that &sect; 1256.1 was to be construed as referring only to incarceration that was not a substitute for a fine that could not have been paid. Therefore, it was an abuse of its discretion for the Board to have denied unemployment benefits. The court reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment that denied the petition for writ of mandate was reversed, with directions to the trial court to grant a writ of mandate directing the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board to set aside its order. The Board had jurisdiction to liberally construe the challenged statute, and as indigency was the sole reason for defendant having to spend time in jail, it was an abuse of its discretion to deny the unemployment benefits.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 5105 that permitted respondent to refuse applications that might carry connotations offensive to good taste and decency. The trial court denied appellant's petition for a writ of mandate to compel issuance of the plate, and the court affirmed. The statutory standard upon which respondent based its refusal to issue the plate was directed only at respondent's employees, did not impose any duty or criminal sanctions on appellant, and was not void for vagueness. Respondent's refusal left appellant free to put the requested words on his car, even in the frame surrounding the plate, and its impact on appellant's right of expression was negligible and incidental. The fact that respondent might have issued a few plates as offensive as the one requested by appellant did not establish that the statutory standard was inadequate or that respondent's refusal was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two named plaintiff claimants, purporting to represent a class of unidentified similarly situated claimants sued defendant state for inverse condemnation damages. The putative class members had not complied with the requirement of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 905.2 that a claim be filed under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 910 before bringing an action in inverse condemnation. The trial court granted defendant state's motion to strike from the complaint all references to plaintiffs other than the named plaintiffs. The court of appeal affirmed. The requirements for a class action of Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 382 were not met because the independent factual issues which would have to be separately litigated would be so numerous that the maintenance of the alleged class action could not possibly serve the judicial process or the parties involved. The court also held that allowing plaintiffs' action to proceed as a class action would be inconsistent with the requirements of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 382 that each person asserting an inverse condemnation claim against defendant identify himself, and disclose the particulars of his claim, including a description of the specific loss incurred.</SPAN></P>

The action against defendant state for inverse condemnation damages did not qualify as a class action because numerous independent factual issues had to be separately litigated for each member of the alleged class. Moreover, the putative members of the class failed to satisfy statutory claim-filing requirements.</SPAN></P>

The evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. Questions referring to defendant's prior incidents with police were proper cross-examination of defendant's character witness, were addressed by limiting instructions, and were not prejudicial. The jury was not coerced to reach its verdict. Defendant withdrew requests for instructions on manslaughter, apparently for rational tactical reasons, and any error in omitting those instructions for the jury charge was invited. Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners challenged the adverse judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California) that concluded that a municipal zoning ordinance that permitted non-profit recreational facilities but not for-profit facilities was not an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process and that a comprehensive plan that eliminated all commercial uses of property did not constitute an equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a consolidated trial cases litigating zoning issues, the trial court issued a judgment concluding that the zoning ordinance at issue, which prohibited the operation of profit-making recreational facilities while permitting non-profit recreational facilities, did not constitute a deprivation of property without due process of law and that the comprehensive zoning plan, which eliminated the commercial use of property within city limits, did not violate equal protection rights. Appellant property owners sought review. In affirming, the appellate court concluded that the zoning ordinance properly distinguished between business and non-profit uses, and its purpose was not for revenue but to provide for the public health, safety, morals, and welfare of the community. There was a rational distinction between the attributes of the commercial and non-commercial recreational uses as well was the burdens each imposed upon the municipality and the residents residing within city litigation. Further, the zoning plan, although it eliminated all commercial use of property, was reasonable in object and not arbitrary. It was thus a justifiable exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the statute could not be applied retroactively, as there was no such express intent therein. Further, the court held that specific language of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 7270 stated that no element of damages not in existence on the date of enactment of that chapter was created. Further, the court held that additional costs appellant requested were properly disallowed as they were not made necessary to secure just compensation for the taking accomplished by eminent domain, and the attorney's fees were not allowable in holdover proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Following the denial of his motion, defendant pleaded nolo contendere to the charge, and was placed on probation. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction. When the officer learned that his initial reason for stopping defendant had no basis in fact, his business with defendant was concluded. The officer did not have reasonable cause to believe that the car was not equipped in accordance with the Vehicle Code, and he had no right to conduct an exploratory examination to discover a violation. There was nothing in the record that supported the legality of the pat-down or the finding that defendant voluntarily consented to the search that revealed the contraband. The fact that defendant had been stopped for a vehicle equipment violation did not provide reasonable grounds for the officer to believe that defendant was carrying weapons. The officer failed to meet his burden of establishing that defendant voluntarily consented to the second search.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a judgment that denied appellant state employee's request for a writ of mandate to reverse a decision of respondent state personnel board to terminate appellant for misconduct under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 19572(t). Appellant was a state tax representative trainee and was convicted of a charge of possessing marijuana while off the job. At his hearing, no evidence other than the conviction was introduced. The court stated that in order to save &sect; 19572(t) from being unconstitutionally vague, it must be applied in light of the type of employment to determine whether or not an alleged failure of good behavior was of such a nature that it caused discredit to his agency or his employment, and that there must be a rational relationship between the goal which &sect; 19572(t) sought to achieve and the failure of good behavior. Finding that there was no obvious relationship between possessing marijuana off the job and the duties of a tax representative trainee, the court concluded that the conviction alone was not sufficient to justify disciplinary action and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants mortgage brokers used the deceptive practice of failing to disclose to prospective borrowers that, if loans were obtained that are outside the amounts of loans to which the statutory compensation limitation was attached, the borrowers would be subject to significant charges and broker's fees. Judgment was obtained against appellants and an order was granted by respondent Department of Real Estate to suspend and revoke their real estate licenses. Appellants challenged the ruling arguing that they were under no duty to disclose the difference in loan and the compensation therefrom, and that the decision was not supported by substantial evidence. The court noted that there was a limited statutory duty to disclose under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 10000, 10131(d), and 10176(a) and (i). The duty was one of fair and honest dealings imposed on all real estate licensees, and, because all mortgage brokers had to have real estate licenses, the duty applied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, faculty members and academic employees, filed a petition for a writ of mandate and declaratory relief seeking to compel respondent university system to grant salary increases for the fiscal year. The petition was denied, the complaint was dismissed, and respondents' demurrers were sustained. Appellants challenged the ruling arguing that the refusal to grant the wage increase amounted to a bill of attainder, that they had an implied-in-fact contract for the pay raises, and that it was an equal protection violation to deny the raises. The court found that the refusal was not a punishment for failure to control campus unrest due to anti-war protests. The court also found that the pay raises did not amount to an implied-in-fact contract because the raises were consensual and to compel the raises would remove the consensuality from the alleged contract. Additionally the court noted that only the legislature could provide the money for the raises and that the equal protection clause did not guarantee absolute equality with similarly situated parties. The court therefore dismissed the appeal to the sustaining of the demurrers and affirmed the judgment dismissing the action.</SPAN></P>

After his conviction, he sought review, contending that the period of his incarceration prior to trial should be credited against his sentence. The court granted the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. It held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 2900.5, that excepted prisoners delivered to corrections prior to its effective date from its provision that pretrial or probationary jail time shall be credited to a minimum prison term, was an unconstitutionally discriminatory deprivation of liberty that did not meet federal equal protection standards or the mandate of Cal.

The reapportionment ordinance had the effect of deferring the right to vote at the next election for some voters. The trial court concluded that the ordinance was invalid as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court reversed, holding that the reapportionment ordinance was based on a rational policy. The plan, based upon rational considerations, which achieved equality of population among the districts, corrected previously existing fragmentation of minority communities, and joined previously separated neighboring cities into a single district did not violate the equal protection requirements merely because it made substantial changes in existing district lines and thus deferred the right to vote at the next election for some voters.</SPAN></P>

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11911 and possession of marijuana for sale under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11530.5. The trial court dismissed the information after granting defendant's motion to suppress because there was an ambiguity on the face of the warrant; the filled-in portion referred to code sections dealing with restricted dangerous drugs while the printed portion referred to narcotics. The prosecution appealed. The court reversed the trial court judgment of dismissal and order granting defendant's motion to suppress holding that the error which occurred in the preparation of the search warrant was purely clerical in nature and did not in any way substantially prejudice defendant's rights. The court held that the fact that there was some error, omission, or ambiguity was insufficient to defeat the warrant's validity where reference could be made to the underlying affidavit. The court found that the issuing magistrate intended to direct a search for dangerous drugs and only by reason of clerical error failed to insert such direction on the face of the warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer brought suit against defendants, state agency and its officials, for allegedly selling real property at less than fair market value and for failure to give a public hearing with respect to the sale. After the trial court sustained defendants' demurrer for failure to state a cause of action, plaintiff appealed. Defendants' demurrer stated that pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 526(a) plaintiff failed to state a cause of action because &sect; 526(a) limited plaintiff's action to officers and agents of counties, towns and cities, and defendants were administrative arms of the state. In reversing, the court held that state officials could have been sued under &sect; 526a. Moreover, plaintiff's complaint was not limited to, nor did not specify, &sect; 526a. The court emphasized that taxpayers had the right to bring actions to enjoin the allegedly illegal expenditure of public moneys by state officials. In rejecting defendants' defense of laches, the court noted that since no prejudice appeared from the face of plaintiff's complaint, such a defense was an improper ground for the trial court to have sustained defendants' demurrer.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, the trial court improperly sustained defendants' demurrer on the grounds of defendants' laches defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), declaring appellant's five children dependents of the juvenile court pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 600 based on the need for proper and effective parental care or control.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitions were filed to declare five children of appellant mother dependents of the juvenile court pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 600. A protective services worker contacted appellant's family while responding to a telephone call from school alleging bruises and cuts were found on one of the children. A caseworker arranged, with the cooperation of appellant, to have the children examined by medical providers. The examination showed two of the children were malnourished with signs of retardation. A neighbor testified to a number of incidents in which appellant had mistreated or threatened to mistreat her children. After taking testimony and other evidence, the court concluded that each of the petitions should be sustained as to Calf. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 600(a) based on the need for proper and effective parental care or control. After a disposition hearing, the court ordered the children to remain in the protective custody for eventual placement in foster homes. Appellant argued that the children should have been provided with child protective services prior to removal. The court affirmed, finding that the court's obligation ran primarily to the welfare of the children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was affirmed. Appellant mother's five children were properly declared dependents of the juvenile court, because some of the minors were the victims of severe malnutrition which had adversely affected them mentally, physically, and socially, thus further harm might have occurred if the state social welfare agency had first been required to offer protective services before taking steps to remove the children from appellant's home.</SPAN></P>
