P. 4.04(2), which provided that when quasi in rem jurisdiction was obtained, a party defending such action thereby submitted personally to the jurisdiction of the court, applied in cases where jurisdiction was obtained pursuant to Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff decedent's unborn child, by his mother, sought review of the decision of the Crow Wing County District Court (Minnesota), which granted defendant decedent's parents and insurers' motion for summary judgment in the unborn child's action that prayed for an injunction against the dissipation of the proceeds by the parents and for an order requiring the distribution of the insurance proceeds to the unborn child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of his conception, the unborn child's parents were not married. Before he was born, the unborn child's father, the decedent, was killed in an automobile accident. The insurers paid the decedent's parents the policy proceeds. Three months before the birth of the unborn child, his mother claimed the insurance proceeds on his behalf. The court noted that the denial to the unborn child of the insurance proceeds was made solely according to his legitimacy or illegitimacy. The main issue on appeal was whether a denial of the insurance proceeds to the unborn child violated his right to equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the facts, when fully developed, would presumably have shown that the denial to the unborn child of participation in the distribution of the proceeds resulted from state action. The court also concluded that the classification of children of an insured according to whether they were legitimate or illegitimate was not reasonably related to a legitimate state interest. If all the genuinely disputed factual issues were resolved in the unborn child's favor then it appeared that he would have been entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment that had been granted in favor of the decedent's parents and the insurers and remanded the matter.</SPAN></P>

Hachey, Judge, remanding to the Public Service Commission proceedings initiated by Northwestern Bell Telephone Company for an order sanctioning certain increases in rates and charges for telephone service, in which proceedings the state intervened.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court directed a discretionary opinion toward its decision affirming an order of the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota), which remanded a telephone rate case to the Minnesota Public Service Commission on review by appellant telephone company and intervenor State in an action by the company brought when the Commission granted a rate increase substantially less than had been requested by the company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company sought a rate increase and an increase substantially less than that requested was granted. Both the company and the State appealed and the district court remanded to the Commission. The court affirmed the decision and then granted discretionary review. The court determined that resolution of the issue required reconciliation of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 237.25 and 15.0425. The court held that &sect; 15.0425 applied to judicial review of telephone rate cases so that the powers conferred in Minn. Stat. &sect; 237.25 were cumulative rather than exclusive. Deference to the expertise of the Commission made remand a necessary option for the district court reviewing telephone rate proceedings, notwithstanding the possibility of delay. Minn. Stat. &sect; 237.25 conferred upon the district court a power that it would not have otherwise had under Minn. Stat. &sect; 15.0425, to avoid remand and draft its own order if the record permitted, but the district court was not compelled to do so if it determined that a just result required further exercise of the Commission's expertise. Whether in a particular rate case remand was appropriate was within the discretion of the district court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed its decision, deciding only the issue of whether the district court had authority to order the remand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimants appealed the order of the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota), which granted judgment on the pleadings to defendant county in an action to recover medical expenses allegedly incurred for maternity care. The trial court held that the failure of the claimants to file a timely appeal from the decision of the commissioner of public welfare barred the claims under the doctrines of exhaustion of remedies and res judicata.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county denied the claimants' request for reimbursement of maternity expenses after the claimants went to an unauthorized hospital in order to avoid lectures on family planning. The claimants filed suit and alleged negligence and violations of equal protection. On appeal, the court noted that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies did not apply if nothing could be accomplished by resort to administrative remedies, and that res judicata did not operate as to claims that were not raised and over which the administrative agency did not have jurisdiction. The court held that although both the negligence and administrative claims contemplated the same relief, the recovery of maternity costs, Minn. Stat. ch. 261 did not, under any reading, comprehend the presentation of tort claims in the administrative proceedings, so that the trial court should hear the negligence claim. The court found that the equal protection claim was based on the county's application of a statute, not the constitutionality of the statute itself, and was subject to administrative review, but held that it made little sense to sever the claim from the negligence claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court in favor of the county and remanded the case for trial on both the issue of negligence and the claim of unconstitutionality in the denial of reimbursement of maternity expenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to secure approval of their application to subdivide, the developers had to make a cash park donation to the city. The developers challenged the facial constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 462.358, subd. 2 (1971), and Bloomington, Minn., City Code &sect; 20.09 II B, which authorized park dedications. The district court upheld the constitutionality of both the statute and the ordinance, and the court affirmed. The court held that even though the possibility of arbitrariness and unfairness in its application was substantial, the enabling statute prevented this application by authorizing dedication of only a &quot;reasonable portion&quot; of the land. Therefore, the statute was upheld as constitutional. A &quot;reasonable portion&quot; was construed to mean that portion of land which the evidence reasonably established that the municipality would need to acquire for the purposes stated as a result of approval of the subdivision. The court held that a provision in the ordinance that stated that, as a general rule, 10 percent of the land was &quot;reasonable,&quot; was constitutional because it allowed for rebuttal of this presumption.</SPAN></P>

There was testimony that she became hysterical, and that defendant was running from the scene when apprehended. Under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.347, subd. 3, evidence of a complainant's previous sexual conduct was not admissible unless the court found that it was material to the issue of consent or fabrication and that its prejudicial nature did not outweigh its probative value. Isolated instances of cohabitation as distinguished from evidence of promiscuity did not in themselves lend credence to a claim of consent such as defendant raised. However, defense counsel was permitted to inquire in relation to contemporaneous sexual relations within a week of the event, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.347, subd. 3(b).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a minor's father and guardian, brought an action against defendants, a city and a county, to recover damages for injuries suffered by the minor when her bicycle wheels became engaged in a sewer grate on a public road. The Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) granted the county's motion for summary judgment because the father did not serve a timely notice of claim under Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.05, subd. 1 (1971). The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father served a timely notice of claim on the city. The city manager notified the father that the road in which the grate was located was a county road and that, thus, the city had no responsibility for the road's maintenance or construction. Ten days later, the father served on the county a notice of claim, which was three weeks after the expiration of the 30-day notice limitation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.05, subd. 1 (1971). The father contended that Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.05, subd. 1 (1971) was unconstitutional and that the notice provided to the county substantially complied with its requirements. The court held that the father's prompt but untimely notice of claim constituted substantial compliance. When two governmental entities jointly used a common facility located within their borders, which facility gave rise to a tort claim, timely notice to one entity followed by a prompt, though not timely, notice to the other entity substantially complied with the requirements of Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.05, subd. 1 (1971). Even if the city had not notified the county of the claim, the county would have available to it the city's investigation and an ample opportunity to further investigate.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 260.125.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court took the opportunity to discuss the standards to be employed by a juvenile court in its disposition of motions for certification of juveniles for prosecution as adults made pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 260.125. The court had previously determined that orders of the juvenile court which denied the state's motion to refer a juvenile for prosecution as an adult were non-appealable. A recent United State Supreme Court case led the court to change that conclusion, and instead hold that those orders were final and appealable. The court rejected the juveniles' contention that Minn. Stat. &sect; 260.125 was unconstitutional. The statute had ascertainable standards that could be followed and therefore survived the challenge that it was impermissibly vague. The statute compared favorably with the Uniform Juvenile Court Act, &sect; 34, which militated against a violation of equal protection. The court imposed on lower the courts the duty of making clear findings for their reference decisions, and such findings would not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing that they were &quot;clearly erroneous&quot; so as to constitute an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Further, the inspection to be done by the building department on the house would, in the normal course of business, be assigned to the employee himself. After a co-worker reported the employee's activities to a supervisor, the employee was discharged. He challenged his discharge, but his terminate was upheld by the city civil service commission and the district court. The employee sought further review. In affirming, the court concluded that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the conclusion that the employee was discharged for cause.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 179.40-179.47, and which permanently enjoined defendants from picketing retail liquor stores except in conformance with certain restrictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A labor dispute existed between the union and a winery. Defendants began a campaign of picketing at retail liquor stores to whom the distributors sold wine for resale. The words &quot;on strike&quot; were in larger print than other words on the picket signs. Pickets occasionally blocked ingress and egress from the retail stores. The distributors sought to enjoin the picketing activities pursuant to the Secondary Boycott Act. Ultimately, the trial court permanently enjoined the pickets except in conformance with certain restrictions. The court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 185.10(5) of the Anti-Injunction Act did not prohibit injunctive relief against peaceful picketing when such picketing was in violation of an express state statute, such as the Secondary Boycott Act, which served a legitimate governmental interest. Further, when otherwise peaceful picketing became obstructive and coercive, a reasonable limitation on the number of pickets was permissible under the First Amendment. However, while the union was obligated to clearly identify the struck product, it was not the proper role of an equity court to tell pickets what words they had to use to express ideas or to whom they could talk.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior action, a private nonprofit corporation was denied an injunction against the enforcement of &sect; 144.145 by the city and the Board. Thereafter, the city held a special referendum, resulting in a vote against fluoridation. Subsequently, city leaders met regarding the fluoridation and the city declared &sect; 144.145 an unconstitutional invasion of individual rights. As such, the Board filed a petition for a writ of mandamus. The court held that the city had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Minnesota Fluoridation Law because the question of fluoridating the drinking water of the city involved a question of substantial public interest to the people of the city and because the city claimed that such fluoridation threatened to destroy its water filtration system. The court accepted as factual the legislative determination that fluoride was a safe and effective means of reducing dental caries and held that the means of achieving the State's purpose was proper and reasonable. Specifically, the court found that, although the actual consumption of water was a private and personal act, the preparation and treatment of that water was a common and accepted public function.</SPAN></P>

Police received information from an informant that while visiting defendant, the informant overheard a conversation concerning a plan that bore a striking resemblance to the plot carried out against the husband and wife. The informant described the method used to conduct surveillance of the husband and wife, i.e., walkie-talkies, and stated that the money obtained was used to buy drugs in California. Police obtained a search warrant for defendant's home that allowed a nighttime search and unannounced entry. Police seized walkie-talkies, tickets to California held in defendant's name, and drugs. Defendant was convicted for coercion and felonious theft. Defendant appealed and argued that the search warrant was improperly issued.

Under the statute in question, the union had assessed a fair share of its fees against the non-union school district employees involved in the instant action. Such assessments were contributions toward the union's representation in negotiations and grievances with the school district. Deductions were taken from the employees' paychecks to cover the assessments without a prior hearing. The district court found that the statute violated due process under the state and federal constitutions in that it did not provide for notice and hearing prior to a determination of the fair share fee for services. The court reversed the judgment, as Minn. Stat. &sect; 179.65, subd. 2 did not violate due process. The procedural remedies encompassed by the statute complied with due process standards, as there were sufficient safeguards in the statute to protect employees from any significant loss of property. Their need for a prior hearing was outweighed by the governmental interest in securing the financial stability of the union, as their exclusive representative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">These were consolidated personal injury actions arising out of a physical education class accident involving minor plaintiff. The actions were commenced and statements were taken before the promulgation of certain amendments to the Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure, which substantially expanded the scope of discovery. Plaintiffs filed a motion that sought the production of all taped and written statements of nonparty witnesses' in defendants' possession. The trial court granted the motion without requiring plaintiffs to make a showing of any kind. Defendants contended that the amended rule, Minn. R. Civ. P. 26.02(3), only applied to the discovery of statements taken after the effective date of the rule. The court observed the procedural rules were to be liberally construed. The court determined that the amended rule applied to all pending actions, unless a trial court determined that its application to particular case would not be feasible or would work an injustice. The application of the amended rule to allow discovery of witnesses' statements collected before the effective date of the rule impaired no vested rights of defendants.</SPAN></P>

The subcontractors moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. Defendant appealed, arguing that, based upon the indemnity clauses, all of the subcontractors formed a pool for the benefit of defendant and were therefore liable to indemnify defendant for all personal injuries arising out of the entire construction project. The court distinguished between indemnity agreements and contracts of insurance, finding that defendant sought to convert its subcontractors into unlicensed insurers.

The court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.01, subd. 20 (1969) had governed the sick-pay exclusion since 1961 and incorporated by reference the then-existing federal definitions of gross income and adjusted gross income.

The court held that the state legislature could not delegate its function to Congress, so that the 1961 federal definition incorporated by reference by Minn.

The Secretary contested the validity of the revenue bond issues because the institutions were affiliated with religions. The district court determined that issuance did not violate the state or federal constitution because the bonds refinanced nonsectarian projects and facilities. In affirming the judgment, the court found that the Secretary did not meet his heavy burden of proving that the legislation would be employed for purposes that violated either the state constitution or the Establishment Clause of the Federal Constitution. The court held that the record indicated that the funds would be used only for non-sectarian facilities, and that the institutions would spend the funds solely for secular educational purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The constitutional question presented was whether Minn. Stat. &sect; 160.05, if construed to extend public dedication of a road to a width of four rods and not simply to the extent of actual use, resulted in a taking of private property without due process of law. The board contended, and the trial court agreed, that &sect; 160.05 constitutionally provided that any road dedicated by adverse public use was dedicated to a width of four rods, regardless of the width of actual usage. The landowners asserted that &sect; 160.05 was unconstitutional because no notice was provided when a width greater than that of actual use was taken and that, as a result, they were denied property without the due process of law. As a result of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2, the court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 160.05 did not authorize a township to widen a road acquired by adverse public use beyond that width actually acquired by such adverse use. Privately owned land could not become public road by adverse use beyond the portion so used merely by a statutory pronouncement. Section 160.05 could operate to dedicate a road by public use only to the extent of actual use over the statutory period.</SPAN></P>

Section 438.02 was applicable only to criminal conduct such as &quot;fighting words,&quot; and not to constitutionally protected activities. Second, the prohibition in &sect; 438.02 could be applied only to conduct that actually disturbed, and therefore it avoided the problems presented by a &quot;tendency-to-disturb&quot; standard. Third, &sect; 438.02 prohibited only disturbance that unreasonably interfered with the right of others to use their property peacefully. The court concluded that, although &sect; 438.02 was out of date and in need of revision, it was not constitutionally defective on its face.

The court held that the trial court's decision was an improper advisory opinion without a determination of what practices were actually followed under current regulations. Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 120.72, 120.73 and 120.74 would render moot many of the issues.

The court reasoned that the weight of authority seemed to find that tapes were functionally similar to writings in all important respects and found that it was irrelevant that the investigator for the Legislative Audit Commission that made the tapes was not a law enforcement official because the language of &sect; 611.033 did not indicate that it only applied to law enforcement agencies.

After trial, the jury's answers to the questions on the special verdict forms were inconsistent. The next day, the jury submitted questions for the trial court. The trial court changed an instruction on whether the patron was negligent and resubmitted the case to the jury. The jury then changed their answers to two questions. Based on the modified special verdict forms, judgment was rendered for plaintiffs and the judgment for the patron was reduced by the amount of her own negligence. Defendants filed a motion for JNOV or for a new trial, which was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed the order. The patron's claim was not defeated by her own negligence because defendants' negligence was considerably greater. The store was a public building within the meaning of Minn. Stat. &sect; 299G.11.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and mother were divorced. The divorce decree awarded custody of their minor child to the mother and ordered the father to pay alimony. The father was also ordered to pay child support until the child turned 21. One month before the child turned 18, the father stopped his payments of alimony and child support. The mother sought to hold the father in contempt, and the father filed a motion to modify the decree to reflect the child's emancipation. The trial court denied the father's motion to modify, found him to be in contempt of court, and denied his motion for rehearing. The court ruled that 1973 Minn. Laws 725, &sect; 74, which lowered the age of majority from 21 to 18, did not apply retroactively to decrees that had previously been entered. However, the court stated that contempt was not available to enforce payments of accrued child support after the child reached the age of majority. The court also concluded that contempt should not be invoked to enforce the payment of support after the child turned 18 because that was contrary to legislative policy as expressed in the statute, although the decree was valid as between the parties and enforceable by ordinary remedies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order in part and reversed that part of the trial court's order adjudging the father to be in contempt for failing to pay child support to the mother.

The department was reorganized, creating the higher-ranked position of lieutenant and designating the positions of police lieutenant and detective for elimination. St. Paul, Minn., Ordinance 15277 was enacted to assign police lieutenants the same grade as lieutenants without a change in duties or responsibilities. The detectives' application for a grade increase was denied. The court held that St. Paul, Minn., Ordinance 15277 did not constitute a promotion without examination in violation of the merit system of St. Paul, Minn., City Charter ch. 12. There was no change in position under St. Paul, Minn., Ordinance 3520, &sect;&sect; 2 and 28(c). The detectives did not overcome the presumption of constitutionality.

A second hearing was not required because of a discrepancy between the estimated and actual assessments because the discrepancy was not related to an underestimate of the project cost. Respondent did not err in deferring the assessment of some areas until a time when they were connected.

The owner argued that &sect; 1.5-f should be narrowly construed, so that having one of the two stairwells enclosed and protected by fire doors was sufficient. Affirming, the court noted that an open stairway created a life-safety hazard by providing an open shaft for hot gases and smoke to rise, thus enhancing the possibility of death to those on the higher floors.

The owner also argued that the provisions of the fire prevention code were unconstitutionally vague; however, the court held that the language &quot;lack of adequate exit facilities or any other hazardous condition&quot; was sufficiently definite.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was accused of the armed robbery of three persons. He was 17 years of age at the time; his criminal history dated from when he was 10. There was no program specifically designed for hard-core, sophisticated, aggressive delinquents; a psychologist testified that the existing programs were not stringent enough for the juvenile and that he was capable of killing someone. The court held that the reasons assigned by the juvenile court for reference to adult prosecution, the lack of an appropriate rehabilitative program, fell short of the statutory requirement of Minn. Stat. &sect; 260.125, subd. 2(d). The absence of rehabilitative facilities did not necessarily mean he was not amenable to treatment as a juvenile. However, the record was not adequate to permit the court to decide whether the juvenile could insist upon treatment as a juvenile before being referred for adult prosecution. The court instructed the juvenile court to inquire whether there was a potential treatment program, whether one could be created, and if so, why there was not one.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order of referral and remanded the case to the trial court for further findings regarding available rehabilitation programs.</SPAN></P>

The trial court reversed the commissioner's order, holding that the Amendment violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court reversed and reinstated the commissioner's order. While there was doubt whether the county welfare agency had standing to challenge the Amendment's constitutionality, the question was sufficiently doubtful so that the court agreed to resolve the doubt in favor of a decision on the merits. Applying a liberal rational basis test, the court concluded that the Amendment did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it did not result in any recipient receiving welfare benefits at a level in excess of established need. It was much more difficult to make a showing of invidious discrimination where there was no alleged denial of welfare benefits, but rather an alleged overpayment. The Amendment was entitled to a presumption of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 168.013 was constitutional on its face because the State was merely seeking a return for the privilege, already exercised, of using its highways at the weight on which the increased license fee was based. The court held that the tax was not an undue burden on interstate commerce.

Under a three-part standard for analyzing Establishment Clause questions, a law must have a secular legislative purpose, the law's primary effect cannot advance or inhibit religion, and the law must no foster excessive governmental entanglement with religion.

It held that the statute imposed a trust character on the payments made to a contractor, and it was a knowing violation of the trust, rather than a failure to pay a debt, that the statute made punishable. It held that the statute did not violate equal protection in that it applied equally to all persons who were similarly situated. Finally, the court held that the statute did not create an invalid presumption in stating that unless the contractor established that the proceeds had been used to pay costs, proof that the costs were unpaid would be sufficient to sustain a finding that the proceeds were used for a purpose other than for the payment of costs. The court stated that the fact that defendant had paid over the proceeds was more easily proven by defendant than by the State, and the burden of producing such evidence was not unfair.</SPAN></P>

Following trial, the court, Bruce C. Stone, Judge, found that the accident resulted from the negligence of defendant Mary Beth Loxton and that plaintiff had sustained total damages of $ 1,060.  Accordingly, the court ordered judgment in plaintiff's favor for $ 945, the amount of the bonds.  Defendants appealed from the judgment entered.  </SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 170.33 subd. 5, under which a discharge did not relieve individuals from the requirement of posting a bond in lieu of proof of financial responsibility pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 170.25 (1). The district court held that by executing the bonds, defendants revived the discharged debt to the driver. On appeal, the court reversed. The court noted that the reaffirmation of a discharged debt had to be clear, unequivocal and voluntary. The court found that defendants executed the bonds under duress, because of their need to reinstate their driver's licenses. The court also found it inequitable to enforce the bond obligation, which it found to be a violation of the Supremacy Clause. The court noted that the commissioner of highways no longer required the bonds, and defendants lacked the financial ability to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 170.33, subd. 5 rather than post the bonds.</SPAN></P>

The court imposed sentence in the alternative, which was either a fine or 30 days in jail. Defendant was ordered to serve the 30 days after defendant failed to pay his fines. Defendant argued that his imprisonment was unconstitutional because he was indigent. On appeal, the court affirmed. First, the court noted that defendant could seek postconviction relief, even though he had been convicted under a municipal ordinance, not a state statute. Second, the court held that the constitution prohibited the state from imposing a fine as a sentence and then automatically converting it into a jail term solely because defendant was indigent. There was no prohibition against incarceration where the failure to pay was due to contumacy rather than indigency. The evidence showed that defendant failed to use due diligence in attempting to find work and to pay the fines. Lastly, the court noted that defendant was allowed to participate in the programs contained in Minn.

Morton and other taxpayers against the Board of Commissioners of Ramsey County and Ramsey County Hospital and Sanitarium Commission seeking an injunction to require defendant board to submit to qualified voters of the county at the next general election the questions of remodeling certain areas within St. Paul-Ramsey Hospital and of constructing and equipping an addition thereto in conjunction with the Gillette Hospital Authority, and also to restrain defendants from proceeding with the financing and construction of said improvements until approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon.  The State of Minnesota and the Gillette Hospital Authority were permitted to intervene.  Upon motions of the plaintiffs and of defendants for summary judgment and upon stipulated facts, the court, Stephen L. Maxwell, Judge, ordered summary judgment in favor of defendants and the intervenors but included in his order a finding that defendant board would be required to submit to the voters of Ramsey County the question of constructing said addition as to costs, including equipment, in excess of $ 5,600,000.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By their action, the taxpayers sought to enjoin the construction of an addition to the hospital and to compel the board to submit the construction issue to the electorate. On appeal, the taxpayers argued that the trial court's order should be reversed because the pertinent state statutes were erroneously construed and applied unconstitutionally. Specifically, the taxpayers contended that the situation was controlled by Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 376.009 to 376.07, which explicitly required submission of proposals for the purchase, erection, or construction of hospital buildings to a &quot;vote of the people.&quot; However, defendants maintained that &sect;&sect; 376.009 to 376.07 did not apply. Furthermore, they argued that 1974 Minn. Laws 581 provided that an election was not required with respect to the proposed construction. The court held that the trial court correctly concluded that 1974 Minn. Laws 581 justified defendants' action with respect to the bond issue and the hospital construction plans. Additionally, the court held that after a close review of the facts of this case, it found no denial of the taxpayers' due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The city and county appealed and the taxpayers filed a notice of review of the judgment and order denying their motion that said assessments were to be held void for the year 1972.

Further, the court determined that the ruling as to the validity of the 1971 taxes did not extend to the 1972 taxes because the statutory proceedings under Minn.

The court stated that although the question was a close one, the village official's status was sufficient to give him standing in the proceedings. The court found the issues to be of unusual public concern. The court held that the statutory scheme for revenue sharing embodied in 1971 Minn. Sess. Law Serv. 24 reached a constitutional accommodation between the tax burdens imposed and the benefits derived therefrom to a degree which satisfied the requirements of the uniformity provisions of Minn. Const. art. 9, &sect; 1. The presumption of constitutionality which the statute enjoyed was not overcome by any explicit demonstration that its application resulted in a hostile and oppressive discrimination against the residents of particular units of government.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 273.111, should be granted. The county challenged the constitutionality of the statute and argued that, when the landowner did not farm the land but leased it for farming to others, the use was not agricultural.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A landowner petitioned the county to have his land classified as agricultural for purposes of the Green Acres Statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 273.111, which gave preferential tax treatment to farm land. The tax assessor denied the petitions; but the district court granted them. On appeal, the county attacked the constitutionality of the Green Acres Statute but gave no notice to the state attorney general under Minn. R. Civ. P. 24.04. The court first held that it had jurisdiction to consider the constitutional challenge despite the lack of notice, overruling its prior decision in In re Condemnation by Oak Center Creamery Co. v. Grobe, 264 Minn. 435, 119 N.W. 2d 729 (1963). The court then held that the Green Acres Statute was constitutional, because its classifications of land according to use were reasonable. The Green Acres Statute did not offend either Minn. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1 or the Fourteenth Amendment, which extended identical equal protection guarantees. Finally, the fact that the landowner did not farm the land himself but leased it to someone else who farmed it did not mean that the use of the land was not agricultural. The cash rental income qualified as production income.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled In re Condemnation by Oak Center Creamery Co. v. Grobe and held that failure to notify the attorney general about a constitutional challenge to a statute did not deprive the appellate court of jurisdiction to consider it. The court affirmed the district court's decision to uphold the constitutionality of the Green Acres Statute and its application in this case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court addressed the question raised by appellants, in their unrelated petitions for review, of appellants' right to appeal and the court's obligation toward to those appeals with respect to the County Court Act. The court held that the Minnesota Constitution did not guarantee appellants a right of appeal and that the right of appeal was governed by statute. The court stated that the legislative regulation over the appellate authority of the court was designed to aid the court in its exercise of its appellate functions and had not abrogated the constitutionally independent appellate authority to review whatever the court deemed mandated in the interests of justice. The court held that the County Court Act had not violated the Minnesota Constitution. The court found that three counties that were allowed to appeal directly to the court under the County Court Act was not discriminatory and was not a denial of equal protection because the Equal Protection Clause related to equality between persons rather than areas, and no person was being denied their appellate rights by the County Court Act.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff Edward Kindt sought recovery for property damage and consequential damages for his wife's injuries.  Defendants counterclaimed for property damage.  The case was tried before Glenn E.

Plaintiffs' counsel thereupon withdrew his request for the instruction. After the jury returned a verdict, finding that the motorist was 60 percent negligent, plaintiffs moved for a new trial on the ground that the trial court failed to explain to the jury the legal conclusions that would follow from their special findings. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying the motion.

There was no statutory standard or other satisfactory evidence to show that licensed cosmetologists were not qualified to cut men's hair. In regards to health and safety factors, there was no evidence to show that the cutting of men's hair by a licensed cosmetologist would create a danger to the public or that the sanitation requirements under either licensing procedure were harmful to the general health and welfare. The court found that the classification scheme was unconstitutional.&nbsp;U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 guaranteed the liberty of contract to render services in any lawful calling. The State's exercise of police power to regulate in this area had to be rationally related to the promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare. Minn.

Stat. &sect; 632.13(2) had been satisfied in that the ruling of the municipal court was made on January 17, 1973, and the notice of appeal was filed on January 22, 1973. However, for purposes of Minn. Stat. &sect; 632.13(6), the written order was made on April 25, 1973, filed on April 26, 1973, and the case was set for hearing on December 6, 1973, well beyond the 6-month time limitation. It was the obvious intent of the 6-month limitation to guarantee the constitutional right to a speedy trial, rather than the establishment of procedure that the court was to follow. It therefore was incumbent upon the city to inform the clerk of court of the urgency of setting matters for hearing. The procedural requirements was be satisfied in all appeals by the city, and failure to meet them precluded the court from an exercise of its jurisdiction to hear an appeal. Nevertheless, inasmuch as jeopardy had not attached, the use of the phrase &quot;with prejudice&quot; by the lower court was inconsequential.</SPAN></P>

The retailer made a pretrial motion for the suppression of evidence obtained by the search of the bookstore, which the court denied. The retailer appealed and the court reversed. The court held that the retailer's conviction could not stand because he did not have clear notice of the legislative proscription that fundamental fairness required, since the courts did not agree on what materials were subject to regulation under the ordinance. The court found that the ordinance did not comport with the requirement of specificity and, since fair notice was the basic rationale for the requirement of specifically defined sexual conduct, the ordinance's construction did not afford requisite notice with respect to a sale made over four years prior.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the issue was whether Minn.

The court noted that preventing indemnification to a third-party tortfeasor from a negligent employer fostered no legitimate objective. No substitute remedy had been provided to the owner. Therefore, the court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.061, subd. 10, violated the due process clause of U.S. Const. amends. V, XIIII and it violated the Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vending machines had no mechanism available for taking pennies or returning them as change. The trial court concluded that Minn. Reg. Tax S &amp; U 9(f)(4), which provided that food from vending machines was taxable, denied vending machine owners equal protection of the law because the owners were unable to pass the sales tax on to the consumer like other retailers. The court reversed, observing that Minn. Stat. &sect; 297A.02, which imposed a sales tax on all retailers, and Minn. Stat. &sect; 297A.03, which allowed retailers to pass the tax on to purchasers, were two independent provisions. The vending machine owners' adoption of a method of business which, for mechanical reasons, prohibited them from taking advantage of the pass-on provision did not automatically exempt them from the provision imposing the tax, nor did it constitute arbitrary discrimination against them. Even if the same products would have been tax-exempt if sold by a grocery store, such unequal tax treatment was not enough to overcome the presumption of taxability found in Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the state and various state officials, sought review of the decision of the Ramsey District Court (Minnesota), which entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs, six former district court judges, regarding the constitutionality of certain provisions of statutes providing for their retirement compensation. The trial court found that the provisions were unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Six former district court judges filed suit against defendants seeking declaratory judgment that certain statutory provisions purporting to amend the amount of retirement compensation due each judge. When each judge was elected to office, the retirement provisions, codified at Minn. Stat. &sect; 490.102, provided that, upon retirement, the judge was to receive a benefit equal to one-half the compensation allotted to his office. The provision was later amended to read &quot;one-half the compensation allotted to his office at the time of his retirement.&quot; Five of the six judges retired prior to the amendment, and one after the enactment. The trial court held that the provision was unconstitutional as to the five judges who had retired prior to the enactment. The court found that the original language of the statute as it was in place when the judges took office acted as a unilateral contract offering the judges certain benefits as deferred compensation in exchange for their performance as judges. As such, the court found that the state court not constitutionally alter the terms of the contract as to any of the judges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment as to five of the judges, and modified the trial court's judgment as to the sixth judge. The court found that the statutory provisions were unconstitutional as applied to all the judges, and modified the trial court's order to reflect that the sixth judge also be entitled to retirement compensation at the same rate as the remaining five judges.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad on its face and was applied in a fair manner. The court found that a fair and full reading compelled the conclusion that the only misbehavior intended to be prohibited was that which disturbed or threatened the public peace. The court held that the language of &sect; 609.705(3) was not so vague that a person of common understanding could not know that it forbids three or more assembled participants to so conduct themselves as to disturb or threaten the rights of other members of the public to have peace and good order prevail. The court found that defendants had disrupted the food service operation of the restaurant, impeded all vehicular traffic in the area, and engaged in an endless stream of shouting and profanities and, therefore, the trial court did not unconstitutionally apply the statute.</SPAN></P>

The village also argued that the Commission did not expressly deal with the factor of existing or potential problems of environmental pollution. The court held that, although the Commission did not expressly deal with that factor, it did allude in its findings to the adequacy of facilities for sanitation and water and for the collection of garbage and rubbish. The court held that the failure to refer explicitly to that factor was not fatal to the proceedings. The court further held that a referendum under Minn.

The wife appealed, arguing that she was a resident of Minnesota and that the durational residency requirement was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's order dismissing the wife's complaint without prejudice. The court held that the residency requirement was not sufficient to require the strict, compelling-interest test because the ultimate right to file for divorce was not affected by the durational requirement. The court concluded that &sect; 518.07 did not deny equal protection because it was rationally related to the legitimate governmental objective of ensuring the domicile of the divorce applicants.

Stat. &sect; 481.01 was amended to allow the money collected as registration fees from attorneys to be deposited with the state treasurer under the assurance that it would be kept in a special fund and would never cancel. However, the state officers proposed to divert the money from the special fund to the general revenue fund of the state without an appropriation of a like amount to the court. The court held Minn. Laws 1973, ch. 638, invalid as a violation of the separation of powers. The court found that regulating the legal profession was its own duty and solely within its own power. Thus, the attorneys' funds could not be turned over to the state general fund. Consequently, the court enjoined enforcement of the law.</SPAN></P>

His 21st birthday was some five weeks after the election, for the term that began on January 2, 1973.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners, whose roadside property was taken by the Town Board to widen the adjoining roadway, complained of a judgment of the Carver County District Court (Minnesota), which denied their claim for damages, and from an order denying their motion for a new trial on the issue of injunctive relief. The property owners contended that the uncompensated taking of roadside property pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 160.05 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the motion for a new trial was based solely on newly discovered evidence and did not question the constitutionality of the taking, the constitutional issue was not within the scope of appellate review of the order denying that motion. Because the property owners stated no ground for a new trial as to injunctive relief, no question of law was raised. The court therefore affirmed the trial court's order denying a new trial as to injunctive relief. The notice of appeal also stated that the appeal was from the judgment, however, the judgment had not been entered and, under Minn. R. Civ. P. 58.01, the appeal was premature and was dismissed. Even if the court were to have accepted the property owners' oral revision of the written terms of the notice of appeal, stating that the appeal was from the order for judgment, the appeal from the order for judgment was not timely under Minn. R. Civ. App. P. 104.01, which required that an appeal from an order be within 30 days after service of written notice of filing thereof by the adverse party. The notice of appeal was dated more than two months after the Town Board served the written notice of the order for judgment and was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

In reaching its decision, the court held that the language of the statute was clear and explicit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota), in which he was convicted of visiting a disorderly house, in violation of St. Paul, Minn., City Legislative Code, &sect; 469.01. Defendant originally pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 days in the workhouse. He subsequently appealed to the trial court for a trial by jury, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 488A.27(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on presumption of innocence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt, in instructing the jury that it would be permitted to return a verdict upon an agreement by five-sixths of its number, and in denying defendant's motion to dismiss the case because the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court concluded that a proceeding that could result in incarceration for 90 days was criminal in nature and that defendant should receive the same procedural considerations, despite the historical practice of treating city ordinance violations as civil matters. The fact that certain acts were proscribed by ordinances enacted by a municipal corporation rather than by state criminal statutes made them no less criminal in nature. The court therefore decreed that in all proceedings for violation of a municipal ordinance that may result in the penalty of incarceration and which were commenced after the date of the court's decision the defendant was to be presumed innocent until the contrary was proved and, in case of reasonable doubt, was entitled to acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction on grounds that he should have been given the presumption of innocence and his guilt should have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to obtain a conviction. The court remanded the case and instructed the trial court that the five-sixths verdict instruction not be given on the new trial. The court found no merit in defendant's other arguments on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the ordinance was enforced against him and not against others who similarly parked residential trailers within the township. The court held that a conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement, based on a rational exercise of police or prosecutorial discretion did not itself establish a constitutional violation; however, an intentional decision by public officials, acting as agents of the State, not to enforce penal regulations against a class of violators expressly included within the terms of such penal regulation did constitute a denial of equal protection. The court found that the evidence, including an admission by township officials that the ordinance was not always enforced, compelled it to conclude that township officials systematically discriminated in the enforcement of the ordinance at issue and thus, defendant's conviction had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the landowners' request for a discretionary review of the order of the trial court. The landowners argued that the taking of their land was not for a public purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The land sought by the authority was located within an industrial park which, in a prior action, was determined to be blighted or marginal. The property was improved with a building which was over 40 years old and which had been used by the landowners to warehouse and distribute beer. The warehousing use conformed to the plan of the park's development, but the building did not meet the overall plan of development because it did not meet the park's restrictive covenants. In an underlying action, a private company sought to compel the authority to lease the landowners' property to it pursuant to a prior agreement. In an attempt to settle the underlying action, the authority sought to condemn the landowners' property in order to lease the building to the private company. The court held that the taking of the landowners' parcel was an unconstitutional taking of private property for a private use. The court further found that the leasing of the property to a private party for 30 years without substantial change in the nature or character of the property was inconsistent with constitutional requirements for the proper taking of private property.</SPAN></P>

The sewer system was not constructed by the municipality but by a corporation, the stock of which was wholly owned by the builder. The third-party complaint did not allege a common liability for concurring negligence; a requisite for shared responsibility by contribution. Instead it attempted to offer the homeowners a different tortfeasor, which was an impermissible use of the third-party action under Minn. R. Civ. P. 14. The municipality was not notified of a tort claim against it as required by Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.05. The builder contended that &sect; 466.05, at least in its application to the third-party action for indemnity or contribution, unconstitutionally deprived it of due process or equal protection of the law.

The court held that defendant established under &sect; 611.026 that he was laboring under such a defect of reason from mental illness that he did not know the nature of his act or that it was wrong, and that he should have been found not guilty because of insanity, particularly given his extended mental illness, his inability to control his actions at the time of the offense, and his inability to distinguish between right and wrong. In so holding, the court determined that a strict and literal construction of &sect; 611.026 was inconsistent with its underlying objectives, basic principles of law, and constitutional requirements. Instead, evidence could be received freely so that the factfinder could take into account of the entire man and his mind as a whole.

The court held that although the language of &sect; 425.03which prohibited a person from possessing a firearm in a public place, was broad and inclusive, it was not so vague and indefinite as to be invalid. The court declined to pass on hypothetical situations raised by defendant in which the ordinance might fall for vagueness and indefiniteness. Defendant contended that the gasoline service station where the alleged offense occurred was not a public place within the meaning of the ordinance.

The court found that the proposed amendment was manifestly unconstitutional. The proposal would confer the right of referendum with respect to any action taken by the city council, not limited to the adoption of ordinances.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff advertisers and landowners appealed a decision of the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota), which granted a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim filed by defendants, the State and state highway commissioner. The advertisers sought declaratory and injunctive relief arguing that Minn. Stat. ch. 173 (1969), requiring removal of certain advertising signs, was an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A statute required the removal of nonconforming signs four years later, allowing time so as to compensate sign owners by amortization instead of eminent domain. The advertisers sought relief, arguing that the amortization period was unreasonable and arbitrary and was a taking without just compensation. The trial court dismissed the constitutional challenge for failure to state a claim. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the trial court erred in dismissing without an evidentiary hearing to develop the facts necessary to decide the constitutional issue and that the advertisers were entitled to an opportunity to prove that the amortization period was unreasonable or arbitrary. The court ruled that the case was properly filed as a class action, given the large number of signs to be removed in the state, the issues common to all of the sign owners, and the importance of reaching consistent results for all those affected. The court concluded that the question of whether due process of law was otherwise available was not properly before the court and that a mandamus action to compel eminent domain proceedings could not be filed until the constitutional issue was decided.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment dismissing the advertisers' complaint and remanded for an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

Silica dust was extensively prevalent in the tunnel near the machine while it was in operation. Four years after his last exposure to the silica dust, he was diagnosed with silicosis. The employee petitioned the commission for disability benefits. The commission denied his petition for benefits because the three-year limitation in Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.66(3) had run. The court granted certiorari upon the relation of the employee. The employee contended that the three-year limitation should not have begun to run against him until the silicosis was manifested at his examination and diagnosis as opposed to the date of his last exposure to silica dust four years earlier. The court held that &sect; 176.66(3), clearly indicated that the legislature intended a strict denial of compensation for disability due to silicosis where the disability did not occur within three years after the employee's last exposure to the hazard. Since the employee's last exposure to silica dust was more than three years before his disablement occurred, the commission's decision was proper.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the testimony of the non-accomplices amply corroborated the testimony of defendant's accomplices and, thus, the trial court properly admitted it. The court further held that there was no constitutional impediment to the State's use of defendant's accomplices who testified under the expectation of leniency with respect to their sentencing because their credibility was naturally suspect and witness credibility was a question for the jury.</SPAN></P>

The court thought that the instructions were quite sufficient to explain the elements of the offense under decisions of the United States Supreme Court and to enable the jury to determine whether defendants were guilty or innocent of the charges against them. It seemed to the court that the particular selection of magazines and books placed in the windows, accompanied by the signs warranting that the shopper could not be arrested in the store, were designed to represent that the material found in the store was erotically arousing, salacious, and prurient and therefore constituted pandering, denying defendants First Amendment protection.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled the clerk was not required to issue a marriage license and specifically directed the license not be issued. The applicants appealed from that order, arguing that the absence of an express statutory prohibition against same-sex marriages evinced a legislative intent to authorize such marriages. However the reviewing court looked at the historical background of the statute and determined it did not authorize marriage between persons of the same sex. The applicants also argued the statute was unconstitutional because the right to marry was a fundamental right of all persons and that restricting marriage to only couples of the opposite sex was irrational and invidiously discriminatory. The reviewing court stated the Fourteenth Amendment was not offended by the state's classification of persons authorized to marry. The order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of aggravated robbery. Defendant appealed his conviction on multiple grounds. Defendant had been identified after the robbery by a person who was present at the robbery after the person looked at some pictures at police headquarters. The person claimed that he attended school with defendant and stated that defendant was the robber on the sound of his voice and from his build and just from looking at him. Four eyewitnesses identified defendant as the robber although there were some inconsistencies in their testimony as to the robber's dress and appearance. There was other evidence that defendant had visited an apartment across from the site robbed with a gun in his possession and asked for a nylon stocking and that he returned later in the evening with $ 10 bills in his possession. The only witness for defendant had testified that he couldn't see what the robber had over his face but that his hair was blond. Since the jury accepted the testimony of the State's witnesses as the truth and defendant had not preserved objections, there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the conviction and the court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

Kroiss and Margaret C. Kroiss upon application of defendant Ray Kroiss Construction, Inc., to allow construction of multiple-family dwellings on property owned by Raymond Kroiss; and of an amendment to said permit issued upon application of defendant Pemble Development, Inc.

The Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota) denied relief and the landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first developer filed an application with the village council for an extension of the M-1 zoning and for a special-use permit for a planned unit development and filed a proposed plan of development for the entire property. After two hearings, the planning and zoning commission recommended approval of the application and the village council unanimously granted it. The second developer sought an amendment to the special-use permit for a portion of the acres covered; this amendment was approved. Affirming, the court rejected the landowner's contention that the developer should have applied for a variance rather than a special use permit to allow multiple dwellings in an R-1 zone. The ordinances in question, Shoreview, Minn., Mun. Code &sect;&sect; 913.091 and 913.130 (1967), were specifically intended to give the village flexibility to allow substantial variances from the provisions of the Municipal Code by way of special use permits. The approval of the planned unit development amended the comprehensive plan to the extent the development did not conform to the plan. Although a resolution rather than a motion was required by &sect; 913.130, the permit was not invalid on that basis.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held 1969 Minn. Laws 824 to be constitutionally valid. The only issue on appeal was whether the act contravened U.S. Const. amend. XIV, or Minn. Const. art. 9, &sect; 1. The court held that the classification of recreational vehicles in 1969 Minn. Laws 824 was predicated upon a characteristic common to recreational vehicles and not to vehicles falling under other classifications. The court found no confiscation of property by failing to allow for depreciation of recreational vehicles because it was not a violation of the uniformity requirement, in that the length of time such equipment was used did not necessarily establish a decreased value of it. Age was not indicative of value. The language was not unconstitutionally vague because the terms used, such as &quot;house trailer,&quot; &quot;slip in camper,&quot; or &quot;van,&quot; were terms that were in common usage and the owners had little difficulty in determining the applicability of the taxing statute to property so described.

The inmate pleaded guilty of the Tennessee charge and began serving his sentence in Tennessee before he was returned to Minnesota to continue serving his sentence for aggravated forgery. The inmate sought postconviction relief on the ground that Minnesota lost jurisdiction over his person because of a breach of the executive agreement. The court affirmed the trial court's order denying relief. The executive agreement clearly provided that the inmate would be returned to Minnesota upon demand.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners brought an action to recover damages for trespass and unlawful appropriation of their land under Minn. Stat. &sect; 160.05, subd. 1, claiming that the trail from their driveway was never established as a public road but was merely a part of their private property. The trial court disagreed, finding that the contested lane became a public road before the landowners purchased the property. On appeal, the court affirmed that finding because the trial court's application of the statute to the facts was justified by evidence that in 1946 the entire length of the lane was graveled and &quot;crowned up,&quot; snowplow crews worked on the road, the road was graded, weeds were mowed, culverts were installed, and there was evidence of some public use of the contested portion of the road. Remand was required because the lower court made no findings of facts pertinent to wrongful removal of trees from the roadway or from the landowners' property and neither awarded nor denied recovery for the alleged wrong. Under Minn. Stat. &sect; 160.22, the developers would be liable if they wilfully cut down trees on the property or in the roadway running through the landowners' property without permission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Safety Responsibility Act provided for the suspension of the license of any uninsured motorist after the commissioner received a report of an accident with damage in excess of a certain amount unless the driver deposited security in a sum determined sufficient by the commissioner. Such suspension was without a presuspension hearing. The district court held that the suspension provisions of the Act were unconstitutional and ordered the motorist's license returned. The court held that the absence of a statutory provision for a presuspension hearing did not deprive the motorist of due process. The court distinguished those cases, which found that prehearing deprivation of public assistance benefits unconstitutional. Public assistance benefits promoted more important governmental interests and provided a means by which to live. However, the court held that the commissioner's determination of the amount of security required had to be based upon competent evidence comprised, at least, of a sworn statement of the other motorist. That was not done in this case, and the motorist was entitled to the return of her license.</SPAN></P>

On review, the traveler argued that there was no clear legislative mandate that &sect; 466.05, subd. 1 was intended to apply to the MAC, and supported his argument with a case holding that &sect; 466.05, subd. 1 did not apply to a housing redevelopment authority.

The court reasoned that a personal injury claim asserted agsint a private corporation was different that one asserted against a public cooperation. There was no legislative intention that the MAC was to be treated other than as a public corporation for the notice of claim statute. The court also found that &sect; 466.05, subd. 1did not violate Minn.

In the final analysis, the test of the constitutionality of a warrantless search was reasonableness and that the issue of reasonableness was one of fact and depended upon the particular circumstances in each case. The record showed that the mother had apparent authority over the entire premises and that defendant was not a tenant although defendant made a payment. There was evidence that defendant occupied the room with his siblings. Thus, the mother's consent to search was proper. Second, the court held that the premises was a dwelling under &sect; 609.58 because access to the owner's living quarters, which was adjacent to the store premises, was easily accessible by opening a hall door.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. XIV, that by stipulation, subd. 4 was not severable within itself, and therefore the tax was also unconstitutional as to purchases by contractors. The court ruled that: (1) because the question of severability was one of law and because the matter was of great public moment, the court was not bound by the parties' stipulation; (2) the exemptions from the sales tax on purchases of highway material both by contractors and by the State, provided in &sect; 297A.25, subd. 4, were severable as a matter of law; (3) the purchase of materials by the contractors for use in the construction of state highways was not an unconstitutional invasion of the state trunk highway fund; and (4) the imposition of the sales tax on direct purchases by the State was an unconstitutional diversion from the trunk highway fund to the property tax relief fund.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to Resolution B, the board paid each of the striking teachers for seven days during the strike period. Plaintiff, the attorney general of the State of Minnesota, brought this action to determine the legality of Resolutions A and B. The trial court issued a permanent injunction that prohibited the school board from paying the compensation provided by the resolutions. The court affirmed and found that once a person violated the provisions of &sect; 179.51, the employment was automatically terminated by Minn. Stat. &sect; 179.54.

Laws 570, which authorized the use of public funds to transport children to sectarian schools. The actions were consolidated and the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota) determined that the statute was constitutional. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants claimed that the statute violated the state constitutional provisions that prohibited public taxation for a private purpose and that prohibited the appropriation of public money for the support of schools wherein the distinctive doctrines of a religious faith were promulgated or taught. Appellants also claimed that the statute violated the state and federal constitutional prohibitions of establishment of religion. The court held that although the statute went to the verge of constitutional power, it did not go beyond. The court found that the statute served a legitimate secular purpose in promoting the safety and welfare of children required to attend school under compulsory attendance laws. The court also found that although the statute somewhat encouraged attendance in sectarian schools, its purpose and primary effect was neither to benefit religion nor to support sectarian schools. The court ruled that whatever support the statute gave to sectarian schools was purely incidental and that the statute was a valid exercise of the state's police power in promoting public welfare.</SPAN></P>

If the legislature had intended to include Percodan-Demi (oxycodone) within Minn. Stat. &sect; 618.081, it would have included it by name. Petitioner's sentence of 10 years' imprisonment was not cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution because the sentence was one-half of what petitioner could have received under Minn.

Plaintiffs claimed that the section violated the equal protection clause by making an unreasonable classification of the schools, persons, and properties affected by the law and thereby denying the pupils in the excepted districts the benefits of better educational opportunities. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' action, and the court affirmed. The court held that the association was asserting rights that only belonged to the pupils, and therefore no justiciable controversy existed between the association and defendants. Further, there was no impairment of the teachers' contractual rights resulting from the enactment of the statute as the teachers who would be affected by the law would be treated no differently than they would if they were in any other district. In addition, the affected teachers were not denied due process of law, and the statute was a valid exercise of the state's police powers.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied appellant's motion for post-conviction relief and the court affirmed. It was previously determined in another decision that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict convicting appellant. The court held that there was no showing that the county attorney discriminated against appellant by prosecuting him because the ex-wife's denial of appellant's visitation rights was not proscribed by Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 609.26 (1965). Appellant's sentence and fine did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment and the county attorney's refusal to make appellant's children available as witnesses did not violate any of appellant's constitutional rights. The court held that the corroboration by the children was not required for a conviction under &sect; 609.26 and that the absence of the children was immaterial as other competent evidence supported the conviction.

The court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the question of whether &sect; 169.974, subd. 4(a) bore a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, and welfare and whether it was unreasonable or arbitrary were questions that were committed to the judgment of the legislative body. Unless the decisions of that body on those questions appeared to be clearly erroneous, the court would not interfere. The court determined that the legislature had plenary power over the regulation of the privilege to use the highways for the safety and best interests of the public.

Plaintiffs also argued that to draw a line created a favored class in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2, and Minn.

The court affirmed the judgment, finding that plaintiffs did not actively or passively participate in the designation of another action as a case that would test the continued validity of an established doctrine. The court found that the equity in the appeal brought by plaintiffs, who were explicitly informed through the other case of the court's probable decision in their appeal, did not warrant the making of another exception.

The court determined that as defendants framed their attack on the ordinance, it would compel the court to ignore completely the conduct of defendants that gave rise to their prosecutions. The court found that the prevailing practice was to refuse to hold a statute unconstitutionally vague unless required to do so by a consideration of facts particular to the case to which the facts applied. The court concluded that defendants' challenge provided no factual basis for determining whether the ordinance, as applied to the conduct for which they were convicted, was so vague as to require defendants to guess whether their conduct was prohibited. Consequently, the court held that defendants failed to establish that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague on its face and declined to pass upon purely hypothetical issues. Likewise, there was no factual basis to support defendants' argument that the ordinance forbade what &sect; 609.33 permitted.</SPAN></P>

The creditor sued the debtor alleging a wrongful conversion of lithographic negatives by the debtor. The creditor garnished the debtor's accounts receivables. Faced with more garnishments the debtor sought a restraining order to prohibit further garnishments, but was denied relief, which required the debtor to secure a bond. The trial court denied the debtor's motion for an order canceling and terminating the garnishment bond. On review, the court reversed. The economic burden that the debtor sustained stemmed directly from the garnishment proceedings. It inflicted a hardship that was different only in form and not in substance. The court held that the garnishment of accounts receivable without prior notice or an opportunity to be heard rendered the garnishment statutes unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner filed a petition with the city clerk of the city requesting that his property be rezoned to permit the construction of apartment buildings. The land in the area had been zoned single or two-family residential for nearly 45 years. The petition did not contain the written consent of the owners of two-thirds of the neighbors located within 100 feet of the property sought to be rezoned as required by Minn.

The court held that the consent statute and ordinance did not illegal vest in the adjoining property holders the power to legislate or impose unreasonable restrictions. Rather these laws conferred only the right to waive legislatively imposed restrictions that were already in place.

Laws ch. 661, &sect; 5, the statute which prescribed the procedure for establishing the school district's mill rate for tax purposes. The trial court denied the taxpayers relief. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court rejected the taxpayers' contention that the statute violated the separation-of-powers doctrine. Moreover, the court found that the title of the statute conformed with the requirements of Minn. Const. art. 4, &sect; 27. The court further found no merit in the taxpayers' argument that the statute permitted the board of estimate to limit the mill rate without regard to uniformity. The court rejected the taxpayer's claim that the statute vested the judicial power of vetoing the mill-rate increase proposed by the board of education in a non-judicial body, the board of estimate and taxation. The court so held based on its finding that the function imposed on the board of estimate and taxation by the statute was not judicial. The court found no merit in the taxpayers' remaining contentions and, thus, concluded that the trial court committed no error in denying the taxpayers relief.</SPAN></P>

Th officers erroneously arrested defendant in the home of a third party after breaking down the door. The officers were not in pursuit of defendant, nor was there any threat that he was about to flee the jurisdiction. The court found that although the arrest was technically invalid under Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 629.34, defendant was not entitled to a new trial because no improper evidence was seized or introduced as a result of the arrest and defendant had not been prejudiced. The court also agreed with defendant that certain procedural errors had been committed by the trial court in it selection of the grand jury and other matters, however, the court determined the errors, even in accumulation, did not act to deprive defendant of a fair trial, and affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Village #1 sought to annex some property.

Village #1 and landowners contended that neither of the rulings of the Commission were justified by the evidence. The court held that the Commission's consolidation order had to be vacated because it was ambiguous when a specific finding was required by the Minn. Stat. &sect;414.02, subd. 3 and Minn. Stat. &sect; 414.03, subd. 4. The court determined that a specific finding was required on whether annexation to an adjoining municipality would better serve the interests of all or any part of the area involved in the consolidation petition than consolidation would.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute,&nbsp;Minn.

The regulation itself limited the prohibition to testimonials which implied that the conditions described in the advertisement had been or would be cured by the practitioner. The court held that the word &quot;testimonials&quot; as used in the Board's regulation referred to testimonials which were expressly or by implication promises to cure or guarantee to cure. The testimonials distributed by the chiropractors violated &sect; 148.10, subd. 1(1) because almost without exception they went beyond simply certifying improvement or relief but claimed that after chiropractic treatment a patient was &quot;able to walk again,&quot; &quot; a miracle had occurred,&quot; and a condition had been &quot;cleared up&quot; or ended.

Stat. &sect; 559.356 (1967) and was arrested in Minnesota under a fugitive warrant. The Governor of Missouri issued a requisition warrant and the Governor of Minnesota issued a rendition warrant. The inmate then applied to the district court for a writ of habeas corpus challenging his arrest and extradition, as was his right under Minn. Stat. &sect; 629.10. The district court made the writ absolute and the sheriff appealed. The court affirmed the decision, holding that the act of leaving Missouri was not one that could be committed entirely in another state. Thus, presence in Missouri at the time the offense was committed was the only one of the alternative requisites for a valid extradition that could be applicable, and it was conceded that the inmate was not present in Missouri during the time specified. Therefore, the Minnesota trial court properly concluded that the writ of habeas corpus should be made absolute. The court further found that the inmate had left Missouri before the effective date of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.356 such that it was not applicable to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a guilty plea to an information charging him with having sexual intercourse with a 16-year old girl. Defendant appealed arguing that he should have been permitted to show a lack of criminal intent because he reasonably believed that the victim was over the age of consent, and that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.02, subd. 9(6) was unconstitutional. Defendant asserted that the girl came to his apartment and lived with him for several weeks. He stated that the girl told him that she was pregnant and 16 years of age. Thereafter, he had sexual intercourse with her. The court upheld the trial court's judgment. First, the court held because there was no record, it was unable to determine that &sect; 609.02, subd. 9(6) was unconstitutional as applied to defendant. The court reasoned that in some instances the criminal intent statute,&nbsp;&sect; 609.02, subd. 9(6), could have been improperly applied to a party, however, absent a record, the court was unable to conclude such. Further, the court noted that defendant did not seek leave to withdraw his plea, and there was no opportunity to conduct an exhaustive hearing to determine whether defendant's prosecution would have lead to an unjust result.</SPAN></P>

The city, in separate actions, approved two assessments, which were appealed by the corporation over a month after the city's actions. The trial court found that the corporation's appeals were not timely under Minn. Stat. &sect; 429.081, it nevertheless heard the appeals on their merits. Because the corporation received no notice of the date to which the city finally approved the assessments, the city made no issue regarding the timeliness of the appeals. The court affirmed and rejected the corporation's assertion that because &sect; 429.081 did not require notice of the date the assessments were confirmed, it was unconstitutional. The court held that the statute's constitutionality had previously been decided, and that the corporation could not complain of notice when it sought and obtained a full hearing on the merits of the assessment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction for first-degree burglary and 20-year sentence, arguing that he was denied his constitutional rights to equal protection, due process, and trial by an impartial jury, due to the State's decision to treat him more severely than his accomplice, who was convicted of third-degree burglary and sentenced to five years in prison. The court held that the differences between defendant and the accomplice included their records of prior but unrelated crimes, their participation in the burglary, and their cooperation with the State. The unequal administration of a statute by state officials was not a denial of equal protection unless an element of intentional or purposeful discrimination were present, which the record did not establish. Defendant waived his right to challenge nine jurors on grounds of bias because he failed to challenge for cause. The jury was impartial because there was no indication that jurors heard any facts in an earlier, aborted trial about the accomplice's guilt.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, defendant asserted that failure to discharge a moral obligation to aid the injured party was not enough to convict him of the crime charged.

Subsequently, the legislature enacted Minn. Stat. &sect; 423.075, subd. 2, which provided that the Veterans Preference Act did not apply to &sect; 423.075, subd. 1. The employees argued that &sect; 423.075, subd. 2 discriminated against them by compelling them to retire at 65 when other veterans in the same class were not required to do so. The court noted that &sect; 423.075, subd. 1 had been found constitutional as applied to nonveterans because its purpose was to remove police officers and firemen from active duty when their age prevented them from performing the physical duties of their jobs. The court held that that rationale was equally sound when applied to veterans, and that the legislature could take away the rights it had granted to the employees under the Veterans Preference Act.</SPAN></P>

While some members of the group took turns mounting the ladder and addressing passersby with a microphone, others held signs and distributed handbills. The speeches protested against President Johnson's foreign policy as to the Vietnam War. Police officers testified that a crowd of nearly 200 people gathered, that the officers had a difficult time keeping an aisle open on the sidewalk, and that the crowd spilled into the street, blocking a lane of traffic. After 15 minutes of allowing the demonstration, the police started to break up the crowd. Defendants were arrested. The court held that the record failed to present the court with specific wrongful conduct of each individual defendant charged with breach of the peace.

Defendant objected to the admission of testimony of police officers relative to the questioning, and the trial court overruled his objection. On appeal, the court held that at the time of the questioning defendant was not under arrest and was not restrained. Further, the court held that because the investigation was in its preliminary stages, the fact that police suspected arson, accelerant, and knew of the smell of gasoline on defendant's shoes did not render the questioning interrogation. The court then addressed defendant's contention that testimony of the medical examiner that defendant's wife was strangled from behind was prejudicial, rejecting the appeal and holding that because the trial judge ordered that the phrase &quot;from behind&quot; be stricken, there was no error in the trial court's denial of defendant's request for a mistrial.

However, the driver did not testify at trial. The lower court convicted defendant of lurking and loitering, and the court reversed. The court held that the ordinances were not unconstitutionally vague because the loitering and lurking prohibited by the ordinances was reasonably understandable to an ordinary person. The court ruled that the prosecution was not only required to prove the acts of loitering and lurking, but it was also required to prove that those acts were done with the intent to commit an unlawful act. However, the court further ruled that because the hearsay evidence of what the driver told the police officers was improperly admitted, and it was possible that the lower court relied upon the hearsay in convicting defendant, defendant was entitled to a new trial on both charges.</SPAN></P>

The court found in part that the district court had jurisdiction under Minn. Stat. &sect; 115.02 (1961), the District was an aggrieved party, and the issues were justiciable. On the record the district court was justified in holding that the standards were unreasonable in so far as they prohibited the discharge of all treated sewage effluent into the river between the mouth of the Rum River and the St. Anthony Falls dam, and prohibited the discharge of major quantities of treated sewage into the river between St. Anthony Falls dam and the Pig's Eye treatment plant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The billboard owner had oral and written leases to maintain billboards in a particular area. The village passed a zoning ordinance creating an exclusively residential neighborhood, which included the area where the billboards were located.

When the billboard owner was told it was time to remove its billboards it filed its action seeking a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutional on its face. The trial court ruled against the owner, although it found that the ordinance had been discriminatorily applied against it. The billboard owner appealed. The court ruled that the ordinance was not unconstitutional on its face. It was a reasonable exercise of the village's police power as such power was currently understood. The ordinance promoted the general welfare by protecting and enhancing property values. Under the facts of the case, the billboard owner was not entitled to compensation for the &quot;taking&quot; of his property. The state statutes gave the village the power to enact its zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with indecent assault, Minn. St. 617.08, waived a jury trial, and appealed from a conviction for which he was sentenced. Defendant admitted having intercourse with complainant. There was ample evidence from which the trial court found defendant guilty. Defendant argued that time elapsed between the time the offense was committed and complainant told her version of the crime to her mother; thus the mother's testimony was not admissible as part of the res gestae. The testimony of the mother corroborated her daughter's, and did not include any new facts. Even if the testimony was not a part of the res gestae, it was admissible in a prosecution for indecent assault or rape. The trial court granted the prosecution's motion to clear the courtroom without an objection from the defense. This was a procedural matter; counsel has implied authority to speak on behalf of his client. Defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to a public trial. Defendant contended that Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order being reviewed would authorize the taking by eminent domain of property owned by the company. The case presented the question of whether redevelopment of a non-slum area which was blighted was a public purpose which would justify condemnation of the property involved. The company argued on review that there was no evidence to support the finding of blight; that there was no evidence that government assistance was necessary to renovate the area; and that the taking was unconstitutional because it does not serve a public use. The court held that the Authority was not required to make a specific finding that existing conditions on property to be acquired were inimical to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare under Minn. Stat. &sect; 462.421. Further, the court held that the evidence established that the taking of the blighted property was for a public purpose and that subsequent transfer of the property to private parties for use as a site for an apartment building was incidental to the public purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that there was insufficient evidence to prove his guilt, that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.625, subd. 1(1) violated the single-subject and title requirements of Minn. Const. art. 4, &sect; 27, and that evidence was inadmissible because notice of intent to use evidence of other crimes did not comply with the requirement that notice be given a &quot;reasonable time&quot; before trial. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that there was abundant evidence to support the trial court's finding that defendant's guilt was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the evidence, particularly when viewed in light of the principle that factfindings by the trier of facts would be upset only when manifestly contrary to the evidence, was more than adequate to sustain the finding of guilt. Additionally, the court found that if the word &quot;utter&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague, then &quot;forgery,&quot; a word of widespread usage, was not unconstitutionally vague and that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.625, subd. 1(1) was therefore not unconstitutionally vague.

Defendant testified that she thought the question referred to her current state of employment. Defendant was convicted of a misdemeanor under Minn.

Minn. Stat. &sect; 43.28 required an employee in the state classified service to resign from the service upon filing as a candidate for public office. Defendant contended that the statute violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments, U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV. The court rejected those claims. The employee did not have a constitutional right to government employment. While the statute restricted defendant's First Amendment rights, by prohibiting him from expressing his political views by seeking public office, such restriction was reasonable. The legislature reasonably determined that allowing government employees to obtain public office while still employed with the government could lead to abuse of the merit system. Campaigning could interfere with an employee's time and devotion to his official duties. The practice could also lead to employees seeking special treatment from superiors and for friends due to holding the public office.

The court ruled that the state had broad constitutional power to establish a common day of rest, repose, recreation, and tranquillity; and held that the exercise of that power did not offend against the First Amendment.Claims of discrimination were also raised as to the exemptions in the statute. The court held that the vagueness and uncertainty in the designation of restricted commodities which could not be sold on Sunday did not afford clear warning to a potential defendant of conduct which could have resulted in severe penal sanctions under the statute. The statute was nullified.

The owner pled guilty and her sentence was suspended on the condition that she obtain a license. After failing to obtain a license, the owner was given 10 days to dispose of her dogs. Two months later, the dog catcher obtained and executed a search warrant for the owner's home and 17 unlicensed dogs were seized and the owner was arrested. The owner was later committed to the state hospital after she refused to eat and was acting in an &quot;irrational manner.&quot; The owner later failed suit to recover damages for the loss of her dogs, for the enforced absence from her home, and for damages to her home that occurred during her absence. In affirming the district court's judgment, the court ruled that the dog catcher and other agents acted in good faith as directed by competent authority in executing the warrant, seizing the dogs, and arresting the owner and, thus, the issue of the ordinance's validity was immaterial. There was no valid cause of action for false imprisonment, and the owner failed to establish the malice element of her malicious prosecution claim.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was discharged for intentionally and falsely stating in his application that he was not a member of any political party or organization that advocated the overthrow of a constitutional form of government in the United States. His conviction was based on informant testimony that he was a dues-paying member of a local chapter of the Communist Party and had served as its treasurer. The court held that regardless of whether the certification requirements were unconstitutional, defendant could not justify his perjury on that ground. Though an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) claimed privilege with regard to reports and records of the FBI's investigation of the chapter, the refusal to strike the agent's testimony was not error.

The court affirmed the judgment of the district court. Because the landowners were entitled to only a certiorari review under Minn.

The probate court issued a warrant committing the patient to the hospital's custody. The court held that the patient wholly failed to establish that the commitment was invalid. A court commissioner was authorized to preside over the proceedings by Minn. Stat. &sect; 535.763. The patient was present and represented by counsel at both the examination and the hearing. The probate court judge's subsequent entry of the judgment was a routine matter, and the patient's absence was not a violation of due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the information was invalid because the underlying statute was vague in not informing him of the nature of the prosecution against him, deprived him of his liberty without due process, caused him to be twice jeopardized for commission of the same act, denied him the right to trial by jury, and embraced more than one subject not expressed in the title. The court disagreed, indicating first that the statute had previously been ruled as not constitutionally vague and that, with respect to the due process claim, the statute was valid in all respects. The double jeopardy claim was without merit because defendant did not show that he had been prosecuted previously for the same offense or convicted or acquitted of any offense arising out of the same conduct. Because the fraudulent issuance of checks within a six-month period could be considered as a single offense in pursuit of a certain course of conduct, defendant was not entitled a separate jury trial as to each check.

The original complaint was signed and verified by a police officer before a deputy clerk of the municipal court, on the basis of which a warrant for defendant's arrest was issued. Defendant made a special appearance in municipal court to challenge the court's jurisdiction on the ground that the complaint and warrant were unconstitutionally executed because they should have been executed before a magistrate not the clerk of court. Because the allegations in the original complaint were deemed by the lower court to be inadequate, a new complaint was executed. The lower court denied defendant's motion to dismiss. Defendant then filed a petition for a writ of prohibition that alleged that the municipal court did not have jurisdiction over defendant and he sought to enjoin the prosecution of the traffic violation. The lower court issued a temporary restraining order. The court made the temporary restraining order absolute. The court held that the function of determining whether the complaint and warrant met constitutional standard were functions that the judiciary could not delegate to the clerk of court.</SPAN></P>

When the attorney commenced his action, the plan had not been submitted to the Authority. The trial court granted the motions to dismiss, and the attorney appealed. The court affirmed the judgment.

Law ch. 839, &sect; 7, Minn. Stat. 179.572, which excepted teachers from the application of the rest of chapter 839, was unconstitutional and severable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were rival groups of public school teachers. In reviewing the legislation, the court held that &sect; 7 was a constitutional classification and that the clear legislative intent was that the teachers were not to be included in the provisions of ch. 839, as other measures had been proposed and vetoed. As such, the court could not extend its scope beyond the limits of the law's provisions. The court found that ch. 839 covered the whole subject matter of public employees' labor relations and that the act repealed all of the prior laws. Even in the absence of a statute, the employees had no right to strike. Nor did the repeal of the statute, affirming the right to join labor unions, prohibit membership in a union or association organized to promote the teachers' mutual interest. While there was no implied or express power for the school board to conduct an election or to bargain with elected representatives of teacher organizations, there was nothing to prevent the board from meeting with or discussing wages with groups of employees. The court found nothing to prevent collective bargaining if it was entered into voluntarily.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The port authority sought to finance an industrial development project through revenue bonds and through leasing the building to a private corporation. The reclaimed land for the development was &quot;marginal&quot; land under Minn. Stat. &sect; 458.191(4). Although the land had already been readied for industrial use, the president refused to sign the lease. The court affirmed the judgment because it found that a sale by the port authority to private interests was not economically feasible given the acquisition costs and the sales price that could be obtained. The evidence demonstrated that industrial use would benefit the public by creating jobs. In addition, if the port authority did not recoup its acquisition costs, the city's taxpayers would suffer. Consequently, the port authority had not acted arbitrarily in seeking to recoup its acquisition costs. There was no evidence that public funds were diverted. It was incidental that the private corporation also benefitted.</SPAN></P>

After the district court ordered a temporary stay of proceedings to be held before the labor conciliator, the association appealed. The court issued an order extending the stay of proceedings. The court noted that Minn. Stat. &sect; 179.572, which the district court had held to be unconstitutional, provided that Minn. Stat. &sect; 179.52 did not apply to public school teachers. The court noted that if the conciliator was permitted to proceed with his investigation and election, members of the union and the association could be needlessly and futilely distracted from their professional responsibilities in an expensive and time-consuming competition. The court stated that it had advanced the case on the calendar in order to render a prompt decision and that the potential harm which could result from revoking the stay far outweighed that which was likely if the stay was extended until a decision on the merits.</SPAN></P>

The sentence was suspended but subsequently the inmate's parole was revoked. The inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The inmate contended that the desertion statute was unconstitutional because intent was presumed after a desertion of three months, he was denied due process because he was not afforded counsel prior to waiving a preliminary hearing, and he was not accorded a right of allocution. The court ruled that although the presumption was invalid, it did not render the statute unconstitutional. The court noted that the inmate pled guilty and the information expressly alleged intent. The court also ruled that, in view of his guilty plea, the inmate's waiver of a preliminary hearing did not prejudice him. The court also noted that the inmate was provided an opportunity to speak before his sentence was imposed and that the trial court had suspended his sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administratrix brought the action on behalf of the decedent's estate against the corporation for $ 25,000 and an accounting of a partnership. Judgment was entered for the administratrix in May 1965. The findings were amended in November. Later that month, the administratrix served on the corporation two notices of appeal from the orders in May and November 1965. The administratrix claimed that the court could review the case under Minn. Stat. &sect; 605.09(d), (h). The court held that the orders were not appealable. Orders in trust matters, receiverships, and other special proceedings were final and appealable. The administratrix's action was an ordinary common-law action for a partnership accounting in which the administratrix also sought a money judgment. The fact that one of the defendants at one time petitioned the court for the appointment of a receiver in a wholly separate proceeding did not change things. The court concluded that it was not disposed to overrule a long line of cases holding nonappealable orders denying motions for amended findings.</SPAN></P>

Defendants pleaded the statute of limitations and alleged that the claims were subject to reduction under 1963 Minn. Laws ch. 854. The court rejected the trial court's conclusion and held that 1963 Minn. Laws ch. 854 could be applied to claims based upon deaths occurring before its enactment even though no formal claim had been filed until after enactment. There was no showing that the decedent was induced by the existence of benefits under Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 192.38 and 192.39 to enter membership in the National Guard. Principles of justice and equity were not violated because the only effect of the application of 1963 Minn. Laws ch. 854 was to prevent double recovery. The distinction that 1963 Minn.

If the State had access to the accused's interviews with the psychiatrist, the interviews would violate the accused's privilege against self-incrimination in U.S. Const. amend. V and Minn.

The county proposed to redistrict the county such that a city, in which the residents lived, would have been limited to only two commissioners, as required by &sect; 375.02. The residents filed an action protesting the redistricting, asserting that its population was 62 percent of the total population of the county. By allowing the three other districts, which collectively only constituted 38 percent of the county population, to have equal voting power, the residents' votes were significantly diluted. The trial court agreed, holding that &sect; 375.02 violated the state and federal constitutions because it did not respect the requirement of &quot;one man, one vote&quot; found in the Equal Protection Clause. On appeal, appellants contended that the Fourteenth Amendment did not apply to the apportionment of county commissioner districts. The court held that it did apply.

After the federal court dismissed the federal suit, the state court granted defendants' motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court affirmed and held as follows: The dismissal of the federal claims in federal court was res judicata for the federal claims in state court. Because the probate court, not defendants, had the duty to provide the patient with an attorney and hearings, they could not deprive the patient of his due process rights. Because defendants complied with the probate court's order, they were immune from the patient's tort suit.

Petitioner continued on probation for almost one and one-half years, when, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect;609.14, the stay and probation were revoked after hearing and petitioner ordered committed to serve the sentence previously imposed. At issue was whether petitioner was entitled to credit toward the expiration of his sentence for time spent on probation. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the court was able to vacate the stay and reinstate the sentence at any time. The court held further that the legislature had determined what sentence to impose and that they treated persons on parole and those on probation differently, which did not discriminate against them in such a way as to violate equal protection. The court held that the trial court had to be able to uphold the threat of imposing the sentence to encourage people not to violate probation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged by information with the crime of sodomy in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 617.14, but indecent assault was submitted to the jury as a lesser included offense over defendant's objection. Defendant appealed from an order denying his motion for judgment of acquittal or in the alternative a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court denied him the fundamental right to a public trial by excluding spectators because of the nature of the crime and the anticipated testimony. The court held that the constitutional mandate for a public trial was an assurance to the accused that he would be dealt with justly and protected not only against gross abuses of judicial power but also against petty arbitrariness. The order of the trial court that excluded everyone from the trial, except members of the bar and press, solely upon the ground of the obscene nature of the crime and anticipated testimony, exceeded the power of the court to limit attendance and violated defendant's constitutional right to a public trial. The court further held that while the evidence clearly supported defendant's conviction of the crime of indecent assault, that offense was not a lesser and included offense of the crime with which defendant was charged, sodomy. To submit a lesser and included offense, the State must show that the offense charged could not have been committed without necessarily committing the lesser and included offense. It was not essential in proving sodomy to prove an assault.</SPAN></P>

The court held that prospective application of the Escobedo decision was the better course to follow unless the U.S. Supreme Court decided otherwise. While it was good procedure of the police to advise an arrested person immediately of his rights, the failure to give that advice would not of itself have made a subsequent confession inadmissible, but the absence of such warnings would have been a significant factor in testing whether the confession was given freely. Therefore, the court affirmed the decision because: (1) the conviction of petitioner was final before Escobedo; (2) the record failed to show any affirmative action on the part of law enforcement authorities, denying petitioner the services of retained counsel; (3) a U.S. Supreme Court case holding that there should be a separate determination of voluntariness applied prospectively as well; (4) there was no adequate objection during trial based upon the constitutional grounds asserted.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed that the classification in the statute making the possession of empirin unlawful, but not cough syrup, was reasonable where the liquid cough syrup was more difficult to conceal than tablets, the cost of cough syrup would be prohibitive if available only by prescription, and the benefit and convenience to the public in securing cough syrup over the counter outweighed the potential dangers inherent in permitting its purchase without a prescription.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court was whether the Minnesota legislature, consisting of the senate and the house of representatives, had sole and exclusive power under the Minnesota Constitution to redistrict and reapportion. On appeal, the court answered the question in the negative and reversed the grant of summary judgment to the residents. The court held that the language used by the framers of the Minnesota Constitution in dealing with the problem of apportionment gave the governor the power to require a two-thirds majority of both houses in order to give to apportionment legislation the effect of law. The court reasoned that to say that the governor had the power to veto laws passed by the legislature was not to say that he had the power to compel a concurrence of two-thirds of the membership of both houses in all instances where the legislature exercised authority granted it by the Constitution. However, the court opined that deciding that the executive power to assert a qualified veto was put in the Constitution as a check upon the power of the legislature to redistrict and apportion did not imply that the use of the veto in this particular case was or was not prudent.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court quashed appellants' service, appellants sought review and prevailed. Minn.

Section 540.152 did not require the existence of an agency relationship between the university and the NCAA, although jurisdiction could be based thereon. Instead, jurisdiction would lie if the university was an NCAA member and had some part in any transaction, act, or activity on behalf of the NCAA out of which the action arose.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the commissioner of employment security (commissioner), brought an action for review of the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota), which reversed a decision of the commissioner determining that respondent employers were required to contribute to the Minnesota unemployment fund on the basis of wages paid during 1961.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employers were three corporations that were subsidiaries of a New York parent corporation. Each of the employers was organized in Minnesota in 1961 and employed salaried employees for less than 20 weeks in 1961. Five officers of the parent owned the stock in the employers. The commissioner determined the officers were employees who worked for more than 20 weeks during 1961 and therefore the entire entity of the parent and subsidiary employers could be considered a single employer in determining the liability of the employing units involved. The court concluded that the service of the officers could not be counted as &quot;employment&quot; within the meaning of Minn. Stat. &sect; 268.04, subd. 10(1). The term &quot;employment&quot; as used in subd. 10(1) had to be given the meaning ascribed to it by subd. 12(2, 3). Thus, an employing unit was not within the definition of &quot;employer&quot; where the services performed, whether by officers of a corporation or employees, were all performed outside the state and were therefore not &quot;localized&quot; in the state. The services of the five officers of each subsidiary could not be considered as &quot;employment&quot; in Minnesota because they performed no services in Minnesota.</SPAN></P>
