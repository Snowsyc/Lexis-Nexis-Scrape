</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant presented five issues for review. First, the court found that defendant's U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV rights were not violated because these protections were not so all-inclusive that they covered all statements made or published by individuals or organizations. Second, the court found that the admission into evidence of a legal petition was proper without further identification because it was properly certified as being correct by the authorized court official, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:457. The court also found that evidence established that the defamation, made in a court proceeding, was, in fact, a false statement and was not privileged or justified as a comment made in the reasonable belief of its truth. The court found that the testimony of defendant's mother and a second jointly charged defendant could not form the basis for any reasonable belief on the part of defendant that the charges he made against the district attorney were true.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect;&sect; 19:141-160, to expropriate appellee owners' land. The owners asserted that &sect;&sect; 141-148 were unconstitutional, null and void, as the legislation authorized a taking of property by ex parte order prior to the payment of just and adequate compensation.The district court (Louisiana) declared the statutes unconstitutional. The authority questioned the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The words &quot;after&quot; as used in La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 and &quot;previously paid&quot; as used in La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 15 were not meaningless, nor inserted without design. The clear import of their meaning was that payment of just and adequate compensation must precede a taking. Therefore, the legislature was powerless to enact legislation that permitted a taking until payment of such compensation had been made or at least tendered and deposited to the owner's court registry account. Aside from constitutional provisions rendering the legislation invalid, null and void, the very language of La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 45, which created the authority, provided that it should exercise its eminent domain power as provided for under general law. The general expropriation laws were embodied La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:1-14 and La. Civ. Code Ann. arts. 2626-2641. The law which the legislature made applicable to the authority was special in character and the authority's use of it transcended the scope of the constitutional limitations that required the authority to expropriate under the general law. Therefore, the authority could not avail itself of &sect;&sect; 19:141-19:160, even if they were not otherwise invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a judgment of the trial court (Louisiana), which quashed a bill of information charging defendant with violating La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:285 by unlawfully making a local anonymous telephone call to a female and making vulgar, obscene, profane, lewd, lascivious, and indecent language and threats.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's response to defendant's motion for a bill of particulars admitted that he had made no threats to the victim. Defendant filed a motion to quash, arguing that a threat was an essential element of the crime charged. The court held that an amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:285, adding the phrase &quot;and threats&quot; was not intended to require that threats be made in addition to obscene language to constitute the crime. The amendment's sole purpose was to forbid as a separate and distinct act the making of threats. The word &quot;and&quot; was used in a disjunctive sense, the aim of the amendment being to enlarge the scope of prohibited acts to include the use of any threats, regardless of whether they accompanied obscene language.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and set aside the judgment of the district court, overruled the motion to quash, and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the court directed certiorari to the Court of Appeal, First Circuit (Louisiana) to review its judgment affirming a trial court's reversal of a decision of the review board of defendant Administrator, Division of Employment Security, Department of Labor, State of Louisiana. All wage credits of defendant claimant earned with plaintiff employer were cancelled pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1601(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues were whether the claimant for unemployment compensation benefits was entitled to wage credits from the employer and whether the employer filed a timely appeal. After the employer terminated the employee, there was a final decision affirming the Administrator's holding that the employee was terminated for misconduct. The employee renewed his claim after he left subsequent employment, and the Administrator found that his disqualification under &sect; 23:1601(2) was removed because he left the later employment under non-disqualifying circumstances. The review board affirmed, and the employer appealed. The court found that, after the disqualification for misconduct, the Administrator had a mandatory duty, as prescribed by &sect; 23:1601(2), to cancel the wage credits that the claimant earned with the employer. The employer was not required to appeal from the first determination, even though it was silent with respect to wage credits. The employer was justified in its belief that the Administrator would perform the mandate of the statute, and it timely appealed when the Administrator made its finding that the claimant's disqualification was removed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged under the statute after he organized a large demonstration of black citizens to protest the incarceration of other blacks. The evidence showed that the demonstration involved up to 3,800 people, who congregated around the blocks surrounding the courthouse. On appeal, defendant contended that the statute violated his rights to free speech under U.S. Const. amend. I. The court affirmed the conviction, emphasizing that the right to free speech was not absolute. The court held that picketing was not the equivalent of free speech and was not beyond the control of the state to control how such picketing or demonstration was conducted. The court found that the demonstration was not peaceful and that it interfered with the administration of justice. The court noted that the courthouse had to be closed and that the crowd had to be dispersed with tear gas. The court rejected defendant's contention that he was denied a fair trial because spectators were segregated in the courtroom. The court found that defendant received and fair and impartial trial and that his complaints of segregation pertain to the rights of other individuals, and not himself.</SPAN></P>

The demonstrators occupied the sidewalk across the street from the courthouse and refused to move when so ordered by the police. They also occupied part of the street forcing traffic to be rerouted. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences. The court noted that the right of freedom of speech was not absolute and the State could by non-discriminatory legislation, under its police power, regulate the exercise of that freedom. The court noted that municipal authorities, as trustees of the public, had the duty to keep their communities' streets opened and available for movement of people and property, the primary purpose to which the streets were dedicated. The court held that anyone who failed or refused to disperse and move on when ordered so to do by any law enforcement officer of a parish in which such act or acts were committed or by any law enforcement officer of the state of Louisiana or any other authorized person was guilty of disturbing the peace.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator optometrist instituted a declaratory judgment proceeding, alleging that where his employer was not licensed, he was threatened with imminent loss of his right to practice and was adversely affected by the rule of defendant board of optometry examiners. The trial court found for optometrist, decreeing that the rule was ultra vires of the board's authority, the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit (Louisiana) reversed, and optometrist appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court directed certiorari for review of the holding that the rule under attack was not ultra vires of the board's powers. The optometrist admitted that he worked for a corporation, but contended that the corporation had not practiced optometry. In reading La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 37:1041(3), 37:1051, and 37:1052, it was evident that a corporation could not meet the requirements recited. The Optometry Act contemplated natural persons, not a corporate group. In adopting the rule under attack, the board interpreted the Act to the effect that an optometrist employed by a corporation would have been violating La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:1061 by associating with an illegal practitioner. However, one who could not meet the statute's requirements, such as a corporation, was not a legal practitioner, so any connection was not violative of &sect; 37:1061(6). The board's rule was administrative, not legislative. It was adopted as an exercise of vested discretion, which was not performed in an arbitrary manner. The attacked rule was, therefore, not ultra vires of the board's powers. The practice of optometry was closely related to public welfare, so regulation by the Legislature was permitted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Louisiana State Board of Embalmers sued to enjoin two defendant funeral directors from embalming without a license. The District Court (Louisiana), after declaring that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 37:840, 37:842 were unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of legislative power, in violation of La. Const. art. II, &sect; 2, dismissed the suit. The Board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:840 stated that the Board was to prescribe qualifications for those who desired to practice the science of embalming and business of funeral directing, in connection with dealing with the care and disposition of human bodies, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:842 stated that a person desiring to practice the science of embalming and business of funeral directing had to be of good moral character. The provisions did not state any qualifications for embalming or funeral directing other than good moral character. The Board was delegated the power to establish other qualifications, but the supreme court agreed that the delegation of authority was broader than the delegation allowed by La. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 1, 2 (1921) and La. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 (1921). The supreme court analogized decisions in which it had found an unlawful delegation of legislative functions with respect to marine diving and watch repairing. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 37:840, 37:842 provided no real standards or guides for the Board to determine licensure qualifications.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated rape and sentenced to death, but asserted that evidence was improperly admitted and excluded, that appellant's right to counsel was violated, and that the report concerning appellant's sanity was inadequate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that evidence of a medical examination and photographs of defendants obtained without counsel was improperly admitted and that his involuntary confession was improperly admitted. Appellant also maintained that brief examinations of appellant indicated that the sanity report was inadequate and that he was improperly precluded from presenting evidence that the rape statute and the death penalty therefor were applied discriminatorily based on race. The Louisiana Supreme Court first held that the examination and photographing of appellant while in custody and without counsel did not violate appellant's constitutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. Further, despite appellant's bare allegations of mistreatment, the evidence supported the finding that appellant's confessions were freely and voluntarily given, and, thus were admissible. Also, any inadequacy in the sanity report only involved the weight of the report, not its admissibility, and any constitutional challenge to the allegedly discriminatory administration of the rape statute was a question of law that was not within the province of the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bill of information charged defendant with the offense of defamation for his comments regarding eight criminal court judges. The record was replete to the effect that the trial judge did not prejudge the defamation matter. Also, a reading of the motion to recuse reflected that it contained general statements of conclusions, which did not constitute grounds for recusation. Thus, the trial judge did not err in denying defendant's motion to recuse. Additionally, the supreme court found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:47-:50 were not null and void and were not prohibited by the First Amendment. Further, because La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 41, authorized a trial by a judge alone in misdemeanor cases, defendant's bench trial was constitutional. In addition, the supreme court concluded that the expressions of defendant, as set out and charged in the bill of information, were of a defamatory nature, they were alleged to be defamatory and to have been made maliciously, and they were not subject to the protection of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Finally, the trial judge properly found that the testimony of the four judges was not hearsay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sellers conveyed several oil, gas, and mineral leases to the buyer. As consideration for the sale, they received a promissory note. Payment of the amount due was secured by a lien and a mortgage on the leases. The buyer later transferred the leases to the owner, without a reference to the lien and mortgage. The conveyances were all recorded. When the buyer failed to pay the mortgage, the sellers instituted an action. The owner intervened, claiming that she owned the leases free and clear of any encumbrances because the sellers' conveyance to the buyer was inscribed after the buyer's conveyance to her. After the trial court rejected the sellers' demand, they sought review. An appellate court reversed the decision, and the owner sought review. In affirming, the court determined that mortgages were effective against third persons from and after the time of their being deposited with the recorder, pursuant to 1901 La. Acts 215. The inscriptions on the sellers' mortgages were duly and timely made. Their effectiveness reverted to the day, hour, and minute of filing; therefore, the encumbrances were valid and binding against the leases acquired by the owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators sought a writ of mandamus to compel the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, to consider their application. The Louisiana Supreme Court ordered the respondent court to pass on the application. The Court of Appeal did not comply, but sought a declaration that Rule XI, Section 1, Uniform Rules of the Courts of Appeal was a valid exercise of its constitutionally delegated rule-making power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first contention, that the Supreme Court's holding in the Wanless case, the unconstitutionality of the rule of the courts of appeal to the extent therein specified, was dicta, was meritless. The conclusion respecting the invalidity of the court rule was deliberate and on an equal footing with the other reason given in disposing of the issue in the case. If the writers of the constitutional amendment of 1958 intended to change the time from which the delays for applying for a rehearing should begin to run under statutory law, La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 2166 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4446B, their design was not evidenced by any language. The elimination of the last sentence of the original constitutional provision could not be regarded to have altered in any respect the import of the language of the first sentence. The obligation imposed on those courts to provide by rule for the giving of notices of their judgments empowered them only to select the means by which counsel of record were to be notified of the rendition of the judgment, and this authority did not extend to the adoption of rules that changed the meaning of the language employed in the constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the leader or minister of a religious sect known as Islam in Monroe, Louisiana.

The supreme court held that: (1) the State had jurisdiction to indict defendant for criminal anarchy; (2) it was not error to admit into evidence a blackboard that was on display during the meeting, since the police properly seized the blackboard; and (3) the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction, since there was no evidence that defendant advocated opposition or destruction of the established government.</SPAN></P>

The inmates sought to be released from imprisonment after the suspension of their sentences had been revoked, and the inmates were ordered to serve their sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates based their petitions on Robinson, where the United States Supreme Court held that Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11721 violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments in that it was interpreted to punish the mere status of addiction, even though resulting involuntarily. The appellate court distinguished La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:962A, as denouncing a series of acts committed intentionally or voluntarily. Section 40:962(A) did not punish the mere status or condition of addiction, which might possibly result unintentionally or involuntarily. Further, the Louisiana law provided for medical treatment, whereas the California enactment did not. None of the inmates was originally imprisoned; instead, immediately after conviction each was given a suspended sentence and placed on probation with instructions to accept medical assistance. They were incarcerated only after violating some condition of the suspension. The inmates were confined for failing to comply with an established system of treatment designed to promote the general health and welfare of all inhabitants of Louisiana, which was clearly within the State's police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, in attacking the constitutionality of 1962 La.

His exhibits illustrated the officials' alleged unlawful and unconstitutional acts. The trial court ruled in the taxpayer's favor and found that the contested sections violated La. Const. of 1921 art. IV, &sect; 10. The appeals court reversed, concluding that the contested sections were constitutional and not violative of the provisions of the Louisiana Constitution of 1921. Together, the contested sections formed a general method of fiscal administration followed by the state for more than 20 years, and represented a conscientious effort to assure an orderly expenditure of the millions of dollars required to run the state government.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, 10 property owners whose lands were situated in a zoning district, brought suit against defendant police jury and another landowner, a drilling company, and sought, inter alia, a declaration that 1954 La. Act 34 and the ordinances enacted pursuant thereto were unconstitutional. The trial court (Louisiana) granted the landowners' motion for summary judgment. The police jury appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge held that 1954 La. Acts 34 was unconstitutional, because the power to zone private property could only have been conferred on the legislature and other lesser governing bodies, such as municipalities and police juries, by specific constitutional authority, and he referred to the fact that that had been the practice since the adoption of the Louisiana Constitution of 1921, which, by La. Const. art. 14, &sect; 29, authorized all municipalities to zone their territory, and constitutional amendments subsequently passed that empowered certain specified parishes to zone property within their jurisdictions. The appellate court did not agree. The fact that the constitution granted to municipalities the power to zone their territory could not have been regarded as a tacit restriction or limitation on the legislative power to delegate such authority to other public subdivisions. Nor did the fact that the legislature saw fit to submit for approval of the electorate for zoning in certain parishes detract in any way from the plenary power of the legislature to delegate similar authority to other parishes not included in the constitutional amendments.</SPAN></P>

The States argued that the police officers entered the residence at issue legally, that they immediately arrested defendants, that the subsequent search was permissible as incidental to a valid arrest, and that the search therefore was reasonable and the fruits thereof were admissible in evidence. The officers had no warrants for either the arrest or seizure. The court found that the officers had reasonable cause to believe that a felony had been committed and to believe that a felony was being committed when they arrived at the residence. They had been alerted by a physician that one defendant continually bothered him for paregoric prescriptions. The arrest was lawful. Further, the search and seizure at the residence were incident to the arrest, reasonable, and valid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court (Louisiana), applying La. Const. art. III, &sect; 16, which provided that a statute was to embrace only one subject and the body of the statute was not to be broader than the title of the statute, declared La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:285, 1958 La. Acts 121, was unconstitutional and quashed the bill of information against defendant. The bill charged defendant with having made certain obscene telephone calls. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bill of information charged that defendant made anonymous telephone threats. The body of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:285 required threats; the title of &sect; 14:285 did not require threats. The supreme court, after interpreting &sect; 14:285 and its predecessor, determined that the title of &sect; 14:285 was broader than the body of &sect; 14:285, because the body contained the additional requirement of a threat in order for there to be a violation of &sect; 14:285. That is to say, the threat was not a crime not described in the title, but was a limit on the broader definition of possible crimes described by the title. Therefore, the purpose of La. Const. art. III, &sect; 16 to prevent the joining in one statute of incongruous and unrelated matters was not violated. The prohibition under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:285 of indecent and anonymous telephone calls accompanied by threats was certainly germane to the prohibition of indecent and anonymous telephone calls. Therefore, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:285 was not unconstitutional under La. Const. art. III, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed and set aside the judgment, denied the motion to quash, and remanded the case to the trial court to proceed according to law.</SPAN></P>

The waterworks and other agencies argued that they were governing bodies of the parish and entitled to a share of the proceeds. The trial court held that the distribution portion of La. Rev. Stat.

The waterworks and other agencies appealed. The court held that the distribution statute clearly indicated that tax proceeds were to be distributed to the various governing bodies within the parish.

The worker and her husband filed an action in tort and in the alternative for workmen's compensation benefits, based upon La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1166. The trial court maintained the employer's exception of no cause of action in tort, and awarded workmen's compensation benefits for 100 weeks for the impairment of a physical function under La. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was carried on the State's payroll as a deputy fire marshal. Defendant was charged with knowingly permitting his name to be carried on the payroll of the Office of State Fire Marshal and receiving payment for services not actually rendered or for services grossly inadequate for the payment received. The payroll was maintained in the Parish of Orleans and all of defendant's paychecks were sent to him at his home in Baton Rouge. All of the checks were deposited or cashed in Baton Rouge and all except one were honored and paid by a bank in Orleans Parish. The trial court overruled defendant's plea to its jurisdiction. On appeal, the court affirmed. East Baton Rouge Parish was a proper venue for the prosecution and such venue did not violate La. Const. of 1921 art. I, &sect; 9 or La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:13. Under &sect; 15:13, where the acts constituting a crime were committed in more than one parish, the offender could be tried in any parish where a substantial element of the crime was committed.

The court held that a question and answer statement made by defendant shortly after the crimes admitting his culpability was properly admitted at trial because it was free and voluntary and not made under the influence of fear, duress, intimidation, menaces, threats, inducements, or promises. The court found that the preponderance of evidence was to the effect that three statements were voluntarily given by defendant, that a proper foundation was laid for their admission; and that weight and effect were considered by the jury. The jury was instructed as to the principles of law applicable to the theory of the case. The court concluded that questions to three expert witnesses regarding defendant's sanity were proper because they followed the language of La. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporations, a gas producer and one of its customers, a paper manufacturer, challenged the assessment of a severance tax paid for gas the producer distributed to various purchasers through pipelines from its plant. The corporations alleged that the tax violated U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8 because it placed an undue burden on interstate commerce. The court affirmed the dismissal of the suit, holding that the severance tax involved was not on the gas itself and was not a property tax or a tax on the ownership of the gas but was an excise tax, imposed upon the right to produce or sever the products from the land. The court emphasized that the tax was imposed at the moment of severance, before its taking into interstate commerce. The right to sever or produce gas from the soil did not constitute interstate commerce but was a local right subject to state taxation. The court held that the tax was not discriminatory merely because it exempted from taxation gas produced for the manufacturer of carbon black. The court found that the corporations failed to show that the classification did not rest on a reasonable basis or that it was unreasonable, discriminatory, or arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision from the court of appeals, which had upheld the trial court's overruling of defendant board's exceptions and concluded that the legislature had waived the immunity of parish school boards from suit. The court held that the amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:51 established the boards as bodies corporate and, as such, they had the power to sue or be sued. Defendant board had contended that the constitutional amendment that empowered the legislature to pass the act that amended &sect; 17:51 was not effective when it was amended. The court disagreed and held that the legislation was enacted at a subsequent session when a constitutional amendment upon which it was dependent for its validity had been proposed at a prior session of the legislature.

It contested the assessment of certain franchise taxes by the tax collector. The court affirmed the denial of the claim for refund. The court held the general allocation formula was constitutional and did not unjustly imposed taxes upon the company. The court noted that a taxpayer who attacked a formula of apportionment of income prescribed by a statute imposing a tax on corporations doing business both within and outside the state had the burden of showing, by &quot;clear and cogent evidence,&quot; that the formula resulted in the unconstitutional taxation of extraterritorial values. The court held the value or worth of the privilege of doing business in a taxing state did not need to be limited to the value of the tangible assets owned or used by the taxpayer therein, and the State had the authority, within certain limits, to measure or compute the amount of an excise or franchise tax upon a foreign corporation with reference to assets or income which were immune to a direct property tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The federal agency brought an action for a declaratory judgment against the state. The State was authorized by its legislature to enter into contracts with the federal government to receive loans and subsidies for the construction of low-rent housing. The federal government required the State to advertise for bids for liability insurance, and to purchase from the lowest responsible bidder. Two companies offered similar rates: one was a stock company, and the other was a mutual company. The mutual company, by virtue of mutual membership, would have provided the advantage of sharing in any profits of the company that might be distributed as dividends, thus making it the lowest bidder. However, La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 12 prohibited the investment of state funds in private companies. The trial court found that the purchase of the policy was not the same as investing in the company. The lower appellate court disagreed, and its judgment was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city council passed an ordinance that redistricted the city in five districts, each containing wards. The smallest of the wards in a district in question had a population that was 28,086 less than the highest populated ward. Various citizens, taxpayers, and residents filed suit challenging the redistricting of the city as unconstitutional. The ordinance was based on the city's Home Rule Charter which made it the city council's duty to redistrict the city into five new districts by ordinance within six months after the official publication by the United States of the population of the city as enumerated by each decennial census. The Home Rule Charter also mandated that wards in each district be as nearly as possible identical in population. The trial court declared the ordinance unconstitutional. On appeal the court held that the ordinance failed to conform with the mandate of the Home Rule Charter with respect to equality of representation. The Home Rule Charter did not allow for a subjective &quot;best interest of the city&quot; determination if equality of representation was thwarted. The constitutional requirement of equality was ignored when the ordinance was passed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Louisiana appealed from a ruling by the Nineteenth Judicial District Court of Louisiana in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which sustained defendant's motion to quash a bill of information based on its conclusion that the bill and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:285, which made the use of vulgar language in a telephone call a criminal offense, violated La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the bill of information did not refer to the statute, it appeared that the basis for the crime charged was La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:285. The court found that if the language prohibited by the statute was described only as &quot;vulgar,&quot; &sect; 14:285 would have lacked the certainty and definiteness that is constitutionally required. But the court noted that the word &quot;vulgar&quot; was accompanied by several specific adjectives. Applying the rule noscitur a sociis, the court found that the other adjectives in the statute imparted a restricted and definite meaning to the word &quot;vulgar&quot; and such association clearly exhibited that it was to be viewed only in the sense of moral baseness. Therefore, the court concluded that &sect; 14:285, when considered in its entirety, was not unconstitutional. However, the bill merely charged defendant with the use of &quot;vulgar language&quot; in an alleged telephone conversation. The court concluded that the information was defective because it did not properly inform defendant of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling by the district court quashing the bill of information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs attacked the contract between defendants, which called for the department to contribute more than $ 5,000.000 toward the construction of the bridge and the authority to charge tolls and to issue revenue bonds secured by the toll charges and the contribution. The court found that the authority was properly created by the governor under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:1092. The department was authorized by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:1152 to enter into contracts with the authority for the construction, maintenance, and operation of bridges. The court concluded that the contract, which provided for a contribution over a 12-year period, was valid and binding. The funds to be employed were derived from the Long Range Highway Fund pursuant to La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 23(4). The court held that the district court correctly concluded that the contract supported the purposes of the related constitutional provisions, rather than impairing or defeating them, as contended by plaintiffs. The toll-bond resolution adopted by the authority was legal and constitutional under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:1093(8), (10). The court concluded that plaintiffs were properly denied injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company was granted a writ of certiorari for review of a judgment of the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal, which favored defendant lessees of mineral rights. The lower court reversed the judgment of the trial court and found that Act 315 of 1940, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5806, did not apply instantly. The company sought a declaratory judgment to have itself declared owner of the mineral rights of previously sold land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This action was instituted pursuant to a directive from the U. S. Supreme Court under the Louisiana Declaratory Judgments Act, La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1876. The court found that its opinion would not terminate the uncertainty or the controversy between the parties, but out of respect for and as a courtesy to the U.S. Supreme Court, it would render an opinion. The controversy arose over the reservation of mineral rights that the predecessor to the company held when he sold property to the United States. The reservation was for a period fixed by the contract of sale. Subsequently, the United States granted mineral leases. At issue was whether the reservation of rights was rendered imprescriptible by La. Act. 315 of 1940, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5806. The court held that the question could not be answered without determining what the parties intended by the mineral reservation, but interpretation of the contract was for the United States courts. The court held that the lower state courts went beyond the directive of the U.S. Supreme Court when they construed the contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court annulled, reversed, and set aside the judgments of both the lower appellate court and the trial court, and the court dismissed the company's suit.

The defendants filed motions to quash, for a new trial and for arrest of judgment, contending that the application of the statute was unconstitutional and discriminatory by denying equal protection and due process. The trial court denied the motions and convicted the defendants as charged. The court affirmed holding that the statute did not reference to any class, race or group and applied to all persons alike, regardless of race. A statute could not be held unconstitutional based on the motives of the legislature. Private discrimination was allowed and the owners of racially discriminating establishments were entitled to summon law enforcement officers to enforce their right to prevent a disturbance, and state action was not invoked.</SPAN></P>

The lower court denied the alleged adopted child's prayer to be recognized as an adopted child and forced heir of the decedents, and dismissed his action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation, organized under the laws of Delaware, was engaged principally in buying, selling, and distributing natural gas in Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Following an audit of its franchise tax return, the corporation paid under protest an additional tax, based on the proceeds of the sale of stock it owned in a Delaware corporation. The corporation obtained a refund and, on appeal, the court amended and affirmed. The court noted that, for tax purposes, intangibles could acquire a situs of their own in a state other than that of the legal domicile of the owning corporation when they were used as an integral part of its business conducted in the other state. Based on the record, the court concluded that there was no evidence that the stock was ever used in any Louisiana activities so as to have acquired a &quot;business situs&quot; in Louisiana. The court found that the same was true as to dividend and interest proceeds. The court, therefore, concluded that the intangibles should not have been employed in computing the franchise tax that was owed by the corporation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a deputy sheriff, was charged with jury tampering under &sect; 14:129 in that he attempted to influence petit jurors in respect to their verdict by making certain statements in their presence. Defendant claimed that &sect; 14:129 was so vague and indefinite as to render it unconstitutional. On appeal from the order quashing the indictment, the prosecution contended that &sect; 14:129 was clear and explicit. Posed for decision was the constitutional question of whether or not the statute set up a reasonably clear standard of criminality. The court found that in order to be valid and enforceable, the statute had to define the offense so specifically and accurately that any reader having ordinary intelligence would know when his conduct was denounced as an offense against the law. The court found that the term &quot;influence&quot; was sufficiently broad to embrace all of the criminal conduct toward petit jurors proscribed by statutes prohibiting bribery and intimidation of petit jurors. The court held that &sect; 14:129 failed to provide fair notice and an ascertainable standard of guilt. Its penal sanctions were left to the discursive application of judges and juries, and it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of aggravated rape and sentenced him to death. The trial court's judgment was affirmed on appeal. In response to defendant's 24 bills of exception, the court found, among other things, that the trial court properly overruled defendant's motion for a change of venue because the proof did not reflect that public opinion in the parish where the trial was held had been fixed against defendant. The court found no error in the trial court's declaration that defendant was presently sane because the record was devoid of any contention that defendant could not understand the proceedings and the nature of the offense with which he was charged, or that he could not assist counsel with his defense. The court also found that the trial court properly overruled defendant's challenges for cause of six prospective jurors because nowhere in the record did the court find any evidence to the effect that defendant was forced to accept an obnoxious juror. Finally, the court found that defendant's written statement, whereby he admitted hitting the victim with a pipe, was properly admitted into evidence because it was voluntarily given without force or duress.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also assessed costs against the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that a use tax was unreasonable as applied to the company and ordered the disputed amount to be refunded. On review, the court disagreed and concluded that the use tax did not infringe upon the regulation of interstate commerce by Congress. The taxed matter, oil production equipment that was manufactured in another state, had come to rest in Louisiana and had acquired a situs in the state . The court also found that the State use tax did not treat any person differently from any other person in a like circumstance. The exemption of an isolated sale from the provisions of the sales tax applied strictly to sales within the State; it had no effect on any transaction outside the state. The property involved had not borne a similar tax in another state. Because Louisiana levied the first assessment on property that was transported to and was used in Louisiana, there was no discrimination nor deprivation of property without due process of law. The court also erred in assessing costs against the State. However, the trial court was correct in its ruling that the depreciated value was the correct value to use when assessing the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the judgment of the trial court by reducing the amount of the over payment that the State was to refund the oil service company by more than $ 40,000.

The village argued that the ordinance was a regulation and was allowed under home rule legislation. The trial court disagreed, and the court in review affirmed by holding that the ordinances were prohibitions, enacted in direct contravention to a state statute, and the statute was paramount authority. The village transcended its authority to &quot;regulate&quot; contained in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:494. As to the regulation concerned the point of measurement for determining whether alcoholic beverage was being sold within the proscribed distance near churches, school, libraries, etc., the court determined that with respect to the premises to be licensed, it the legislative intent to designate as the measuring point the building, structure, or area, in which beverages of low alcoholic content was sold, but not the property line or outer boundary.

The court affirmed and held that the paving assessment was valid and constitutional as to the railroad. Under the provisions of La. Rev. Stat.

The trial court held in favor of the administration and the court held that proper jurisdiction was with the circuit court of appeal and transferred the case accordingly. The court held that since the statute in question had been declared constitutional and the jurisdictional amount in controversy was not exceeded since the relief sought was not a money judgment but a right to be awarded a contract of insurance, an appeal to the court was not proper pursuant to La.

The property owner filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the state needed only a servitude over the property so as not to deprive the property owner of his mineral rights in the property. The trial court overruled the property owner's motion. Following trial, the trial court awarded the property owner an additional $ 847 as compensation. Upon review, the court of appeal reversed the judgment of the district court and awarded a servitude only over the property owner's land. The Court of Appeal further amended the judgment of the district court by striking the sum allowed for the value of the minerals under the land on the ground that the minerals had been restored to the owner. On certiorari, the court reversed, and reinstated the judgment of the district court. Th court ruled that the state, not the courts, had the discretion to expropriate full ownership of the land or merely a servitude. The court noted that the land was already under a mineral lease and was producing oil.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company paid under protest taxes assessed against it by the State under the authority of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:671 et seq., generally referred to as the gas gathering tax statute. It instituted an action against the State to compel a refund, arguing that the statute was unconstitutional under the federal Constitution. While the suit was pending, another proceeding attacked the same statute as violative of La. Const. art. 10, &sect; 21. The district court in the pending action ruled that the tax was unconstitutional under the state constitution and the court affirmed the judgment. Prior to rendition of judgment in its favor, the company moved to re-open proofs to permit it to specifically plead that the state constitution prohibited the assessed tax. The district court granted the motion. The court affirmed. The State argued that statutes were presumptively valid and the district court could not have considered a plea of unconstitutionality unless timely presented. The court disagreed. There could have been no presumption of validity respecting the legislation because it was previously declared unconstitutional by the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The runner-up in a primary election for the office of district attorney filed an action contesting the winner's nomination on the ground that the absentee voter law, La.

The trial court granted an exception of no cause of action filed by the political party. Upon review, the court of appeal upheld the constitutionality of the absentee voter law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1071-1081, but held that the runner-up was entitled to a recount of the absentee ballots, and remanded the case for the recount. Upon remand, the trial court determined that the runner-up's action had abated under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:362. The runner-up sought remedial writs, whereupon the court of appeal reversed the judgment of the trial court. Upon the invoking of the court's supervisory jurisdiction, the court sustained the trial court's judgment, which dismissed the runner-up's action. The court ruled that the runner-up's action had abated, because there was not at least 30 days remaining until the general election required under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:362.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an action that alleged that the board was not a state agency within the meaning of La.

The court of appeal affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the action, holding that in the legislation authorizing the board, 1956 La. Acts 233, there was no indication that the board was not created as a state agency. Plaintiffs argued that the court of appeal ignored a house resolution, which declared that it was not the legislature's intent to establish the board as a state agency, and that the court of appeal's determination that the board was a state agency was an attempt to create a state agency and therefore, violated the constitutional principle of separation of powers. The court affirmed. The court held that a legislative resolution did not have to be given full legal force and effect, that it was not within the province of the legislature to interpret its earlier enactments, and that the interpretation of laws was a judicial function under the principle of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge decreed that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:471 had not been repealed and that the parish police jury had no authority to call a sewage tax bond election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Property owners challenged the results of a tax bond election, contending that the Board of Supervisors lacked authority to hold such an election, and that the election was not preceded by 30 days notice. The court reversed the trial court's determination that the election was void and that the Board of Supervisors was without authority to hold such an election. The court found that the legislature had designated the Board of Supervisors as the governing authority by passage of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 33:3887 and 33:3888, legislation which effectively repealed La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:47, under which the parish police jury had previously been so designated. The court held that &sect; 239:503 was constitutional and that the 30 day prerequisite for legal notice was provided by publication in the parish newspaper four times within one month, consistent with &sect; 239:503. The court rejected the property owners' complaints of irregularities during the course of the election, holding that absent fraud, corruption, or proof that the irregularities complained of would have changed the election, the election would not be set aside.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the statute reserved to the state legislature the right to finally classify schools as all white, all black, or integrated. On appeal, appellants argued that the statute did not give the legislature the right to classify the public schools as integrated. On its own motion, the court held that did not have jurisdiction over the appeal. The court determined that its appellate jurisdiction, as established by La.

The court ruled that the case did not fall within the first classification because there was no monetary dispute between the parties. The court further found that the case did not come within the last six classifications. The court concluded that a request for an interpretation of a statute did not vest the court with jurisdiction, except in cases where the trial court had declared the statute to be unconstitutional.

The Stated argued that the circumstances indicated that defendants' possession of the electric device was for the purpose of illegally taking commercial fish contrary to the law. Defendants were subsequently found guilty of the crime. The court reversed defendants' convictions. Specifically, the court held that &sect; 56:366 violated La. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff candidate sought review of the judgment of the district court (Louisiana), which dismissed his suit to annul the results of a primary election on the basis of the disqualification of defendant nominee under La. Const. of 1921, art. VIII, &sect; 6 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:572.1 by reason of his felony conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nominee had been convicted of a felony 35 years before in a federal court in Arkansas, but had served his sentence and had been a registered voter in Louisiana for 25 years. After he defeated the candidate in a primary election for the state senate, the candidate filed suit to annul the result. On appeal from the trial court's dismissal, the candidate argued that the nominee had not been a citizen of the state for a minimum of five years and was not a duly qualified elector as required by La. Const. of 1921, art. III, &sect; 9 for membership in the legislature. In affirming, the court held that in referring to conviction of a crime as a disqualification from voting, La. Const. of 1921, art. VIII, &sect; 6 addressed only crimes punishable by confinement in the state penitentiary and that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:572.1 was unconstitutional in extending the disqualification to include foreign and federal convictions. The court ruled that when the defendant registered to vote he was a citizen of the state and his statement to that effect was not fraudulent. The court found that the nominee met the requirements of La. Const. of 1921, art. III, &sect; 9 and La. Const. of 1921, art. VIII, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted Ordinance 1559 restricting the size and location of signs advertising the price of gasoline. After the city warned the gasoline retailer that it was in violation by displaying its gasoline price in a sign larger than permitted and other than on the dispensing equipment, the retailer filed suit to enjoin its enforcement. On appeal from a declaration that Ordinance 1559 was unconstitutional, the city and its officials argued that the ordinance was a reasonable beautification and consumer protection measure. In affirming, the court ruled that the display of prices in larger signs would better prevent consumer fraud and the beautification effect was negligible when compared to its effect in violating U.S. Const. amend. XIV and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The court found that the goal was more likely the dampening of price competition.</SPAN></P>

In again remanding, the court ruled that the trial court correctly found that the executive order had no effect on the owner's warrant. However, the court also ruled that, although the previous remand was required to determine the effect of the executive order, the exceptions of no cause and no right of action were peremptory in nature and, under La. Code Prac. arts 345, 346, and 902, could be urged at any time prior to rendition of a definitive judgment, even on appeal.

The city court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The disputed ordinance made it unlawful for businesses that sold petroleum products to post signs larger than a specified size. The city court held that the ordinance wrongfully discriminated against the owner and against the class of business that he conducted and that it constituted an unreasonable invasion of private property rights that deprived him of his property and of its use without due process of law. On appeal, the city claimed that the ordinance was justified under the police power and that the courts were without right to inquire into its intent or motive. The court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The preamble of the ordinance indicated that its two purposes were to prevent fraud in the sale of petroleum products and to beautify the city. The court reasoned that restricting the size of signs on which the prices of petroleum products were printed did not bear a relationship to the prevention of fraud and that beautification was not the natural result of a restriction on the signs of only one class of business. The ordinance was not a reasonable exercise of the police power because it bore no rational relation to public health, safety, morals, or welfare.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found defendant guilty. Defendant relied upon two bills of exception on appeal that attacked the validity of &sect; 14:402 under La. Const. of 1921, art. 2, &sect; 2. On review, the court affirmed. The court held that the bill of information properly alleged a crime where &sect; 14:402 had been signed by the Governor at the time of defendant's offense. The court determined that &sect; 14:402 did not violate La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State, proceeding under the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:1 et seq., instituted this suit to acquire by expropriation, in full ownership, five certain parcels of land. The State sought to reduce the award to $ 66,000 and the owner asked for an increase to $ 145,924 and, in the alternative, to $ 104,739, including severance damages, and for legal interest on any increase in the award. The court found that the evidence offered by the State as to the value of the expropriated property consisted of the testimony of an appraisal committee comprised of three realtors, who were selected and appointed pursuant to the request of the State, to make a fair and impartial valuation of the property. The court found that the measure of compensation to be awarded the owner in expropriation proceedings was the price which would be agreed upon at a voluntary sale between an owner willing to sell and a purchaser willing to buy. The court determined that the evidence supported by the State as to value was accurate except for the commercial property. The court awarded an additional $ 10,000 to the appraised value of $ 66,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that La. Rev. Stat.

The trial court quashed the bill of information against defendant on the ground that different persons could reach divergent conclusions as to the meaning of the word &quot;intoxicated.&quot; The court held that the offense sought to be denounced, &quot;operating a vehicle while intoxicated&quot;, when read clearly in conjunction with its definition, &quot;while under the influence of alcoholic beverages&quot;, clearly stated the crime sought to be prohibited and that it was sufficient to inform the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation or charge against him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city contended that the action of the trial court erred when it overruled the city's exception of improper cumulation of actions, contending that in this suit, as shown by the prayer of the petition, two different types of relief were sought. The court found that not only was it true that the procedure was summary both in a mandamus suit and in one to obtain a temporary injunction, but, hence, the injunction was simply a conservatory measure to protect the matter in controversy until the final outcome of the primary demand. It was, therefore, clear that the two demands were neither contrary to nor did they preclude each other, and the fact that the city did not have a suspensive appeal of right from the judgment that granted the preliminary injunction was of no moment. Of necessity the injunction proceeding, being merely complementary to the main demand, must stand or fall on the outcome of that demand, and was invoked in order to maintain the funds in status quo pending determination of the controversy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Collector of Revenue for the State of Louisiana, sought review of a judgment from the district court (Louisiana). The district court sustained pleas of prematurity filed by respondent taxpayers in the Collector's summary proceedings under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1574 to collect taxes on capital gains.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers argued, in support of their pleas of prematurity, that the discretion conferred upon the Collector to pursue any one of three remedies under La.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 47:1562 through 47:1565, the Collector first had to assess the tax deficiency and thus afford a taxpayer the right of appealing to the Board of Tax Appeals. The court rejected the taxpayers' argument and reversed the district court's judgment in favor of the taxpayers. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1561, in clear and express terms, vested the Collector with the right, at his or her discretion, to proceed summarily under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1574 for the collection of income taxes. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1562 through 47:1565 only applied when the Collector sought to collect a tax by the harsh remedy of distraint and sale of the taxpayer's property. Because the Collector was not seeking in the case at bar to collect the tax by distraint and sale, the taxpayers were not entitled to formal assessment and notice of their right to an appeal with the Board of Tax Appeals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Realtors, potential candidates for justice of the peace and a police-jury, sought by devolutive appeal review of a judgment of the court of appeal (Louisiana) that affirmed the trial court's judgment that sustained respondents, a police jury's and a committee's, exception of lis pendens; relators brought their case to declare certain ordinances adopted by the police jury unconstitutional. Intervenors were also potential candidates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that it was powerless to hear the appeal because relators had failed to timely perfect an appeal apparently to the court of appeal in the case as required by the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:364E. Section 18:364E provided that the appeal had to be filed in the appellate court within not more than five days from the rendition of the judgment. The trial court had also dismissed intervenors' demands. Relators claimed that they were properly before the court because the record had been timely lodged in the court of appeal on the timely appeal taken by the intervenors, and relators had been cited and served as appellees in that appeal and had filed an answer to that appeal. The court did not agree with this argument; significant to the court was that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:364 specifically gave the party cast the right to appeal and delineated the procedure to be followed with precision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An investigation pertaining to bribery of police officers was on going when a police officer, who was a captain on the force, was called in before a police bureau of investigation. The police officer refused to cooperate with the investigation. Subsequently, the superintendent of police terminated the police officer based on conduct unbecoming an officer. Before this dismissal the police officer was terminated for refusal to give testimony before the Intelligence Division of the United States Treasury Department, but was reinstated. The Civil Service Commission affirmed the police officer's dismissal and denied the police officer's request for reinstatement. The police officer sought review based on constitutional and discrimination contentions, because another captain was reinstated. The court affirmed the Commission's ruling holding that the privilege of holding public office was not guaranteed by the Constitution as an inalienable right, but was subject to terms and conditions. Discrimination on disciplinary actions was disallowed, but the police officer failed to file his request for reinstatement after one year after his termination as required under the local civil rules.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner voters filed the action to compel the registrar to mail out notices to, and make publication of the names of, eight illegally registered voters. The registrar asserted that La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 18:133 made it the mandatory duty of the registrar to mail the notices and make the publication. The trial court denied the registrar's exceptions claiming unconstitutionality. In affirming, the court held that the registrar was without interest to assert the unconstitutionality of a statute as a defense to a suit to compel the performance of ministerial duties imposed upon her by law. The court rejected the registrar's argument that she was directly affected by the statute because the failure to comply imposed penalties on her. The court further rejected the registrar's argument that the affidavits filed by the voters did not meet the requirements of the statute. The court found that the only reasonable interpretation of the statute was that registrants may be challenged who did not possess all the qualifications for registration or who had lost their right to vote in the district. The court rejected the registrar's interpretation that the term &quot;illegally registered&quot; only meant a lack of residence qualifications.</SPAN></P>

The evidence before the Board showed that the applicant was a fugitive from justice in New York, where she was charged with a felony for stopping payment on a $ 300 check, and that she may have practiced medicine previously without a license. Further, since the applicant had no property right to practice medicine in Louisiana, she was not entitled to a contradictory hearing before the Board.

The statute proscribed any public display of any act of lewdness or indecency, grossly scandalous and tending to debauch the morals and manners of the people. The defendant filed a motion to quash the indictment contending that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106(3), was unconstitutional because the terms used were too broad and indefinite to inform the defendant of the nature of the charge. The trial court granted the defendant's motion and dismissed the charge, finding the subsection (3) of the statute too unconstitutionally vague. The court reversed and set aside the dismissal of the charge holding that the wording in the subsection clearly and immediately indicated exactly what the legislature intended. Lack of precision did not mean that a statute was unconstitutionally vague as it related to the requirements of due process. The Constitution only required that statutory language conveyed a sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, without the establishment of paternity by his acknowledgement before a notary public and two witnesses, or by a judgment, there could be no criminal neglect on the part of defendant. The juvenile court did not have jurisdiction to establish paternity of illegitimate children. The court noted that under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that a certain street was a public street and sought to enjoin defendant from impeding its use by the general public. Defendant asserted that he had the legal right to barricade the street because he constructed the road on his land for his own use and that it had never been dedicated to public use. Originally, a permanent injunction was granted but the judge reversed himself and dismissed the suit. That decision was later affirmed. However, in reversing the decision, the court held that the street had been impliedly dedicated to the public use and defendant was estopped from contending that that was contrary to his intention. The street had been used for almost 17 years by the public and had been largely maintained by the municipality. No direct protest was ever made to the mayor or council of the town concerning the public use of the street or the town's maintenance of it. The steps taken by defendant when he closed the road should have been taken years before.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, city residents, appealed a judgment from the trial court (Louisiana), which had rejected their petition against respondent market to stop the market from building parking areas on vacant lots, and to annul the permit issued to the market by the city council on equal protection grounds, asserting that an ordinance, giving the city council authority to grant or withhold such permits, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The market owned and operated a food store on property located in the city, which was zoned &quot;F -- Heavy Commercial.&quot; Next to the market were are two vacant lots also belonging to the market that were zoned &quot;A -- Single Family.&quot; In a petition filed with the city council through the city planning commission, the market sought a permit to construct and maintain on the vacant lots free off-street parking facilities for automobiles of its customers. The planning commission recommended to the city council that the off-street parking request should be denied. Nevertheless, the city council granted the market's petition. Neighborhood residents sought an injunction to stop the market from building the parking lots, and to annul the permit issued to the market on equal protection grounds, asserting that the council, without guidelines, could grant or withhold permits at its whim. The trial court rejected their petition. The court reversed and found the ordinance at issue unconstitutional and invalid on the ground that its provisions failed to prescribe uniform rules or standards to guide the city council, as an administrative agency, in deciding when a permit was to be granted or denied.</SPAN></P>

Involved in the mishap were an automobile occupied by the decedent as a guest passenger and an ambulance belonging to the state. At the time the ambulance was being used in connection with operations of a state hospital and driven by an employee of that state agency. The legislature purportedly granted to plaintiff authority to sue the state. In a supplemental petition she joined the state as a party defendant and pleaded that it, under the doctrine of respondeat superior, was responsible in damages for the alleged negligence of the ambulance driver. The state's exceptions of no right and no cause of action were overruled. The trial court rendered a solidary judgment in favor of plaintiff and against the driver of the ambulance, its liability insurer, and the state. Plaintiff and the state appealed to the court of appeal, which affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court reversed and held that the state's exceptions of no right and no cause of action were valid. The legislation at issue did not create a cause of action in her favor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act authorized the Commissioner to regulate the sale and distribution of milk and milk products to prevent unfair competition and trade practices. The firm attacked the constitutionality of the Act on several grounds. Certain producers and processors were permitted to intervene and joined with the Commissioner in defending the Act. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the firm's contention that the Act unlawfully delegated legislative power in certain of its provisions was without merit. The purpose and intent of the statute was clearly expressed, and the Commissioner, specifically declared to be the instrumentality of the State for the purpose of administering its provisions, was given the duty to execute the legislative intent therein expressed. The court also found that the Commissioner's power to regulate prices under the Act did not violate the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The court stated that price control was unconstitutional only if arbitrary, discriminatory, or demonstrably irrelevant to the policy adopted by the Legislature, and hence an unnecessary and unwarranted interference with individual liberty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several marine divers brought suit to challenge the constitutionality of Act 196 of 1958 under which marine diving was regulated as an occupation. Because the Act adversely affected their livelihood as divers, they prayed for injunctive relief. The trial judge issued temporary restraining orders. The Louisiana Licensing Board for Marine Divers moved to dissolve the restraining orders, alleging that the trial court was without jurisdiction and that the petitions failed to show a right of action. The trial judge held that it had jurisdiction to hear the case because the divers' asserted property rights that were in peril. Subsequently, the trial court recalled the restraining orders and denied a preliminary injunction, holding that the divers had no property rights because their services were rendered beneath navigable waters that were in the public domain. The divers applied for a writ of certiorari. Upon review, the court found that it was the right to work that was at stake and that the place of performance was not relevant. The court held that the Act was patently unconstitutional in that it arbitrarily prevented the divers from practicing their occupation.</SPAN></P>

The victim testified that defendant told her he would kill her and placed his hand around her neck, choking her if she resisted. At trial, color photos of the victim's bruises were introduced. The jury convicted defendant of the lesser-included offense of simple rape. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that the color photos were relevant to corroborate the victim's testimony and were not overly prejudicial. The court held that the offense of simple rape was a lesser-included offense of aggravated rape. The court stated that it was beyond human comprehension that anyone would not believe that a female faced by an attacker, who intended to commit the crime of rape upon her, was not immediately thrown into a state of great fear or an abnormal condition of mind, which was one of the elements of simple rape, and was, therefore, always included within the greater crime of aggravated rape.

The state and the board of institutions filed exceptions to the jurisdiction of the lower court and that of no right and no cause of action, which were founded on constitutional governmental immunity from suit without valid legislative consent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police jury adopted a resolution to pay the membership dues of $ 750 to a property improvement association. The police jury contended that the appeal was cognizable in the state supreme court because the taxpayer's action was one to set aside an &quot;ordinance&quot; of the police jury appropriating the money. The court ordered that the case be transferred to the Court of Appeal, Second Circuit. The court found that it lacked jurisdiction under La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 10 since the amount in controversy did not exceed $ 2,000 and the case did not present for determination the validity of a tax or a fine, penalty, or forfeiture imposed by the state or one of its subdivisions. Further, the court found that the appeal did not involve the legality of a parish ordinance pursuant to &sect; 10 because the challenged action was founded on a &quot;resolution&quot; of the police jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, an African American man and a white woman, were charged in a bill of indictment with the crime of miscegenation in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:79. Defendants were tried jointly and convicted by the trial court. On appeal, the court found that statutes prohibiting intermarriage or cohabitation between persons of different races in no way violate the Equal Protection clauses of the Louisiana Constitution and the United States Constitution. The court found that such statutes fall squarely within the police power of the state. However, the court found that the trial judge committed reversible error when he charged the jury that &quot;habitual cohabitation&quot; under &sect; 14:79 meant access for the purpose of sexual intercourse as a matter of habit. The court found that under that erroneous charge, defendants could have been convicted of the crime of miscegenation without any evidence that sexual intercourse had ever occurred. Accordingly, the court reversed and set aside defendants' convictions and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sued the Board and the State for the loss of 20 registered Aberdeen Angus breeding cows, alleging that the cows met their death by consuming a liquid purchased from the state penitentiary. The trial court overruled a plea to the jurisdiction of the court and exceptions of no right and no cause of action, and rendered judgment in favor of the owner. The trial court had previously dismissed the suit because it was a suit against the State, and the owner had not been properly authorized to institute the action. Thereafter, a private bill, authorizing the owner to sue, was passed by the senate, but was vetoed by the governor and returned to the senate with the governor's recommendations. The court held that the senate intended the bill in its entirety to be presented to the governor for his approval. The owner argued that the bill was separable in its parts. The court found that it did not appear reasonable that the legislature intended that this bill should have been presented to the governor for approval in part only. The court concluded that the bill was not separable and therefore failed in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

The court held that when a constitutional issue was passed on by a city court, a district court, or a court of appeal, the decision was not binding on courts of coordinate jurisdiction, therefore, the ruling by one of the district court judges on the constitutionality of the city ordinance was effective only for the case in which was announced and did not prevent another judge of that court from later determining the same constitutional issue.</SPAN></P>

His constitutional challenge was based on the fact that the method under &sect; 15:196 differed from the statutory method of selecting grand jurors in the other parishes of the State. In affirming defendant's conviction and sentence, the court held that there was no basis to find that defendant was deprived of his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection of the laws simply because the discretion entrusted to the trial judge under &sect; 15:196 might possibly be unconstitutionally and discriminatorily exercised. The court stated that the selection of a venire list or of a jury therefrom was not subject to challenge in the absence of fraud or prejudice. The record in the present case showed and defendant admitted that in fact no such abuse of discretion occurred. The court further stated that defendant cited no provision of the state or federal constitutions that prevented the legislature from providing a different method of jury selection for the Orleans Parish than for other parishes of the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed from a judgment of the district court (Louisiana), which made absolute plaintiff gas company's rule for a preliminary injunction and enjoined the city from maintaining or enforcing the rates contained in a franchise agreement and from prohibiting or interfering with the gas company in the assessment and collection of rates as set forth in a schedule attached to the company's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gas company alleged that because of increasing costs, the fixed rates for gas provided to customers under the franchise agreement were confiscatory, and that the company was operating at a loss and needed increased rates. The city contended that the trial court erred in granting the injunction because the rates were not imposed on the gas company by compulsion but rather, by a valid and binding contract. In reversing the trial court's judgment, the court held that the injunction restraining the city's enforcement of the gas rates was improperly issued. The court rejected the gas company's contention that the state delegated its police power to the city in violation of La. Const. art. 19, &sect; 18 (1921). The court stated that the right of the state to regulate rates by compulsion was a police power, and must not be confused with the right of a city to exercise its contractual power to agree with a public service company upon the terms of a franchise. The franchise ordinance, while binding between the parties, was always subject to the legislative will. There was no showing that the performance of the contract, taking all the years of the term together, would prove unremunerative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, dissolved and set aside the preliminary injunction, and dismissed the gas company's action at its cost.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought reinstatement of their intrusion-into-office suit after it was dismissed by the trial court, which found that the governor improperly removed defendants from the lake district's levee commission under the authority of an unconstitutional statute,&nbsp;La.

In the original appeal, the court reversed the trial court's holding that &sect; 42:4 was unconstitutional but approved of its construction of &sect; 38:1071(B), which enabled defendants to keep their offices. On rehearing, the court again concluded that &sect; 42:4 was constitutional but decided that &sect; 38:1071(B) did not prevent defendants' removal while the appointing governor still served.

Purchases made in the city for delivery elsewhere were made subject to the city sales tax by New Orleans, La., Mun. Code &sect; 831. The merchant claimed that &sect; 831 was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the suit, holding that the merchant had not been aggrieved by the levy and was without interest to file suit to recover the sales taxes. The merchant appealed. The City filed a motion to dismiss. The court noted that a party to a lawsuit had an unqualified right to appeal from an adverse, final judgment and did not have to show a direct pecuniary interest in the suit. Further, the City alleged that the court did not have jurisdiction of the case after the passage of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2716, which prohibited the action taken by &sect; 831, subsequent to the suit because it made &sect; 831 moot.

Further, the specific constitutional provision authorizing ex parte expropriations prior to judgment necessarily controlled in the event of a conflict with general state constitutional provisions pertaining to due process and separation of powers.

The legislation, however, must not be arbitrary or unreasonable. The court found that it was concerned with an object that was not inherently dangerous, noxious or harmful. Rather, the article in question was widely used for numerous beneficial and helpful purposes. If it were reasonable and proper to make mere possession of such an instrument a criminal offense, the Legislature should have also declared the article contraband and forbid the sale thereof. Since La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessors contended that the leases had prescribed because La. Rev. Stat.

In reversing the judgment, the court noted that it had never construed 1938 La. Acts 205 to change the true nature of real rights as defined and understood under the civil law. Instead the court reiterated that Act 205 was remedial and procedural in nature, and that 1950 La. Acts 6, Second Extra Session, which declared that &sect; 9:1105 was substantive as well as procedural, meant not that mineral leases were real rights, but only that they were to be classified as real rights so that the owners of mineral leases should have the benefit of real property laws.

The trial court rule din favor of the car dealer on the question of constitutionality. In reversing, the court held that the provision did not constitute an illegal delegation of the legislature's power to private motor vehicle manufacturers. The court stated that no power had been delegated and that the legislature had merely imposed a condition for a license. The court stated that the right of manufacturers to choose its dealers was merely the right of the freedom of contract. The court held that the provision did not create a monopoly. The court found that the requirement that the dealer be enfranchised was not unreasonable and produced more open competition. The court held that the provision did not deny due process and equal protection of the law because it was a reasonable restriction that bore a substantial relation to the underlying purpose of the regulatory measure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The old commissioners asserted that &sect; 42:4 was unconstitutional because it violated La. Const. art.

The trial court found the provision to be unconstitutional and sustained the old commissioners' exception of no cause of action. The court held that the provision was not unconstitutional. The court stated that, when the provision was reenacted, the title and object of the statute was to &quot;amend and reenact&quot; that specific section. The original enactment referred to &quot;certain public officers and their terms of office.&quot; The court explained that when the legislature reenacted the provision, the effect was to make that provision a law and that the title of the prior enactment was sufficient to encompass the subject of the provision. However, the court found that the special statute applicable exclusively to the district in question limited the governor's power and right to appoint and remove commissioners in that his appointees must hold office during his term of office or until their successors are appointed and qualified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeal, 1st Circuit (Louisiana), certified questions of law in an appeal filed by plaintiff service station operators from a judgment entered in favor of defendants, city and its treasurer, which held that an occupational license tax measured by the gross sales of gasoline was not prohibited by La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 24.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operators filed a declaratory judgment action alleging La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 24.1 prohibited the city's imposition of an occupational license tax that was measured by the sale of gasoline and other motor fuels. The trial court entered judgment in favor of defendants and certified questions of law to the court for instructions. The court exercised its privilege under La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 25 to consider the entire matter as though it had been directly appealed. The court reversed and held that La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 24.1 clearly prohibited the imposition by political subdivisions of excise, license, and privilege taxes on the occupation of selling or otherwise dealing in motor fuels. The court concluded that because the occupational license tax that the city sought to levy was clearly a tax on the privilege of pursuing the occupation of selling gasoline and other motor fuels, the tax was in direct conflict with art. VII, &sect; 24.1. The court reasoned that a contrary interpretation would have in effect eliminated the words &quot;excise, license, or privilege&quot; and violated the principle that all words of a statute should be given effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's prior convictions occurred before &sect; 14:98 was amended by 1956 La. Acts 122. Defendant committed the instant offense after La. Rev. Stat.

Prior to the amendment, the words &quot;intoxicating liquor&quot; appeared instead of the words &quot;alcoholic beverages.&quot; The court held that, even if the words &quot;intoxicating liquor&quot; had not included beer, &sect; 14:98 defined the same crime before and after its amendment because the essential elements of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated were not changed by the amendment.

The court affirmed and found that the issue was whether the statute contravened La. Const. art. X, &sect; 10 and La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 14(a),(b.2),(f),(m). The court held that since no special election was called to approve the district's action, and because no tax was levied, the constitutional limitation on the levy of taxes and the constitutional limitation on bonded indebtedness had no bearing on the legality of the bonds issued by the district under state authority. The court held that because the bond money was to be used for revenue producing public utilities, a constitutional challenge to the enabling statute was untenable. The court found that the statute did not permit the deprivation of the taxpayers' private property without due process, as it had no bearing on the procedure to be followed by the district leading up to the issuance of the bonds, and that such attack could only have been made by private owners adversely effected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner issued an order establishing 13 units containing 640 acres each to govern the production of gas and condensate in a certain area. The order provided that the Commissioner could add productive acreage to any adjacent unit or units if it appeared that only a fraction of any delineated unit was included within the productive limits of the pool. After a public hearing, the Commissioner subsequently amended the first order by issuing a second order that added acreage to two units. The company argued that the Commissioner could not amend his first order to increase the acreage in the two units or, alternatively, that the Commissioner could only accomplish this by rearranging all 213 units to take care of the added acreage so as to establish units of equal acreage. On appeal from the trial court's order in favor of the Commissioner, the court affirmed. The Commissioner acted within his authority under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 30:4(C), 30:6(B).

The candidate also alleged the occurrence of other fraudulent irregularities. Despite finding that irregularities did occur, the trial court upheld the election, finding that the irregularities did not affect the election results. The court reversed on appeal. The court found that the uncontroverted evidence at trial showed that 17 illegal votes were cast during the election and that such votes were sufficient to change the result of the election. The court found that the only persons who could have entered the illegal votes were the commissioners who supported the opposing candidate. By eliminating the 17 fraudulent votes, the court found that the candidate held the majority of the legal votes cast and was entitled to the nomination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:171 et seq., the lumber company, which owned an undivided 31/32 interest in 320 acres, sought partition by private sale against the co-owner, a non-resident of Louisiana who owned the other undivided 1/32 interest. A curator ad hoc was appointed to represent the co-owner until such time as the co-owner appeared by counsel of her own choice. After a hearing to establish the fairness and advisability of a private sale, the trial court found the values of the total acreage and of the co-owner's interest therein and rendered a judgment for the lumber company. The court of appeal affirmed the trial court judgment ordering a private sale and determining the value of the co-owner's interest, and the court in its turn affirmed the court of appeals. There was no merit to the co-owner's contention that she was not &quot;absent&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 9:171 because her whereabouts were not unknown and, thus, that &sect; 9:171 et seq. did not apply to authorize partition. The co-owner was given an equal opportunity to buy the property, and the trial court's findings that the transaction was advantageous to both parties, was fair, and was advisable, were not error.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and noted that the issue was whether the agricultural statutes were regulatory statutes, and whether the pledge of revenues derived under those statutes was a prohibited abridgment of the exercise of the police power of the state under La.

The court agreed with the board that fines, fees, and penalties levied under the statutes were levied under the general taxing power of the legislature, and that the pledge of the revenues was constitutional under La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, members of a city plumbing board, appealed from a judgment of the district court (Louisiana), which held that certain sections of the city plumbing code unconstitutionally delegated legislative and judicial powers. Plaintiff master plumber, based on the board's suspension of his license, brought the action seeking injunctive relief and challenging the city plumbing code's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plumber alleged that the course of conduct taken against him was in violation of the due process clause of both U.S. Const. amend. V and La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6, because the authority for the offensive action by the board was an illegal grant of legislative and judicial power. On appeal, the court noted that in order for the board to validly enact rules and regulations, the plumbing code was required to set forth standards or prescribe fixed and definite limitations. The court noted that an ordinance was unconstitutional when it vested arbitrary discretion in a public officer and board without prescribing a definite rule for their guidance. The court found that many sections of the plumbing code set forth numerous specifications, but did not find any statement as to what standards, specifications, or rules were to govern the regulations formulated by the board. The court concluded, therefore, that the trial judge was correct in his findings that the power granted to the board to formulate regulations was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of a hypodermic syringe and needle. The court rejected defendant's contention that the information was defective because it failed to allege that his possession of the syringe and needle was not authorized by a prescription or physician's certificate. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 228 expressly provided that authorization by a prescription was an exception to liability that had to be raised by the defense. The court also held that a witness's reference to defendant's possible involvement in another crime did not entitle defendant to a mistrial because it was volunteered and the trial judge instructed the jury to disregard it. The prosecutor's reference to defendant's prior trial in argument to the jury did not require a new trial because the trial judge instructed that argument of counsel was not evidence, and the remark did not contribute to the verdict. Insofar as the statute under which defendant was convicted made it unlawful to possess equipment that he lawfully acquired and possessed in another state, it did not violate the full faith and credit clause or abridge his constitutional right to move freely from one state to another.</SPAN></P>

First, the court on appeal held that the indictment did inform defendant of the nature of the case against him where he was charged with attempted murder. The court explained that because it was sufficient to charge a defendant in the short form with murder, it was sufficient to charge the short form for an attempt of the same crime. Next, the court held that the verdict of attempted manslaughter was responsive to the charge of attempted murder because the latter was a lesser-included offense of the former.

The court held that the city was not entitled to injunctive relief when it engaged in illegal discriminatory practices in the enforcement of ordinances with respect to the business owner. The court reasoned that the record amply supported the contention that the city engaged in specific instances of illegal discrimination against the business owner and because it had unclean hands, the city was not entitled to equitable relief.</SPAN></P>

Similarly the court found that any claim of unconstitutionality regarding &sect; 26:285(1) was not preserved for review. The court did consider defendant's claim that she was entrapped by two older-looking 18 year olds who had purchased beer at the direction and with money provided by a marshal. However, the court held that the claim was without substance because it was not a defense to an illegal sale of intoxicating liquor that the purchase was made by a detective of a hired agent because there was a distinction between inducing a person to do an unlawful act for prosecution and catching a person in the execution of a crime of his own design.</SPAN></P>

The State argued that the title of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:71, a statute setting forth penalties for issuing bad checks, as amended by the Act of 1956, was not unconstitutional because of surplus language.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for issuing a bad check. After the jury was empanelled, he moved to quash the indictment, but the motion was overruled. The trial court found defendant guilty of the lesser offense of unauthorized use of movables. Prior to sentencing, defendant filed a motion in arrest of judgment, assailing the constitutionality of the title of the violated statute. The judge sustained the motion, holding that the amendatory Act of 1956 was unconstitutional insofar as it changed prior law as to the issuance of bad checks of less than $ 100. The State appealed. The court found error in the trial court's judgment. It declared that the title of an act was complete when it stated that its purpose was to amend and re-enact a law. Additional language describing the act to be amended was properly disregarded as surplusage. Unquestionably, the court concluded that the additional descriptive clause contained in the title of Act 156 of 1956 did not accurately portray the nature of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:71.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporate stock owners challenged the judgment of a Louisiana district court upholding an income tax assessment made by appellee Collector of Revenue, determining that the owners basis in the stock should be determined using the effective date of 1934, the date the Louisiana tax law became effective. The owners contended that the date should be 1937, the year they moved into the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stockowners purchased their stock before moving to Louisiana in 1937. When they sold the stock in 1952, the Collector of Revenue determined their tax liability using the value of the stock in 1934, the effective date of the state tax law, as the basis for determining the amount of gain to be taxed. On review from a decision upholding the assessment, the owners argued that the valuation violated La. Const. art. X, because only net income was taxable, and that the assessment violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it gave extra territorial effect to the laws of Louisiana and did not give full faith and credit to the laws of the owners' former state. The court rejected both arguments and affirmed, holding that no constitutional violations had occurred. The court observed that the jurisprudence relied on by the owners in support of their position applied to prevent double taxation and Louisiana could validly assess a tax using the stock's basis on the date the tax law became effective because the trigger date for the tax was the date of sale, on the basis could only be computed in accordance with Louisiana law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the members of the parish charter commission and their chambers of commerce and their appointees, and intervenor taxpayers appealed from a judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which decreed that La. Const. art. 14, &sect; 3(c) was unconstitutional. The action was brought by plaintiff taxpayer under the Louisiana Declaratory Judgments Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13:4231-4246.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court noted it was at a loss to know for what reasons and on what grounds the trial judge declared the constitutional amendment to be null and void. Plaintiff was challenging the validity of the appointment by the chambers of commerce of the 15th commission member by arguing that the constitutional amendment allowing it was incompletely entered on the Senate Journal, in that it appeared in its original and not in its amended form. Plaintiff further argued that this erroneous entry was fatal to the validity of amendment because it established a presumption that the Senate never passed the act in the form in which it was submitted to the people for ratification and adoption. The court concluded, however, that the requirement that the amendment be &quot;entered on the journal&quot; did not mean that the amendment had to be published in full in the journal, and that a substantial compliance with the requirements was sufficient. On this basis, the court held that the amendment was not fatally defective where it was incapable of execution. In thus holding, the court necessarily found the appointment of the 15th member of the charter commission was proper.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:110 was not unconstitutional. The court rejected defendants' contention that &sect; 14:110 did not provide a penalty for escape from a place where the offender was lawfully detained by an official of the penitentiary. Section 14:110 was to be construed in a manner consistent with legislative intent. It was common knowledge that &sect; 14:110 was enacted to provide a penalty by which escapees from lawful custody were to be imprisoned for not less than two years and not more than five years.

The board dismissed the taxpayer's petition and ordered him to pay the taxes levied against him. The taxpayer appealed. The tax collector again contended that the board was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The court upheld the board's decision. The court held that the assessment was proper. The court reasoned that the taxpayer failed to present evidence to support his contention that the sales made were wholesale rather than retail sales and where the taxable incidence took place in New Orleans, taxes were properly assessed. Secondly, the court held that the board had jurisdiction to hear the appeal although the taxpayer waited more than 60 days to appeal the assessment when the right to sue to annul an assessment was not governed by the statutory time limit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the injunction proceedings, the city sought to compel the removal of a permanent plastic roof which was erected over a courtyard that separated two buildings in the Vieux Carre section of the city. The roof provided a covered patio area for the restaurant in the building. The trial court issued the injunction and ordered the removal of the plastic roof. Appellants conceded the roof did not conform with the requirements of the Vieux Carre ordinances, but argued the city's action in administering the ordinances were unreasonable, capricious, arbitrary, and discriminatory. The record conclusively disclosed the plastic roof violated the municipal and Vieux Carre ordinances, but the record demonstrated that many similar violations existed in the French Quarter and the city did not seek injunctions against those properties. The court held that appellants made out a prima facie case of discrimination, and the city failed to meet its burden to explain the apparently discriminatory conduct. The injunctive relief should not have been granted until or unless the regulatory measures were enforced in a like manner as to all persons similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The night club owner brought an action for a declaratory judgment against defendants, chief of police, the mayor, and the city attorney, seeking a declaration that his club was a restaurant and exempt from a midnight closing ordinance. The trial court initially sustained an exception as to the night club owner's request for an injunction. Thereafter, upon hearing the case, and the repeal of the ordinance and adoption of another ordinance by the city, the trial court sustained defendants' exception of no cause of action as to the night club owner's other demand for declaratory relief. On appeal, the court ruled that there was no justiciable controversy. The court held that the trial court was correct in sustaining the exception of no right or cause of action as to the owner's demands. The court held that injunctive relief was only available in exceptional circumstances, where an invasion of a property right and irreparable injury was clearly shown and the statute or ordinance was unconstitutional, and declaratory relief could not be used to determine a person's rights or liabilities under a penal statute without a claim of invalidity of the law.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer filed an appeal from the decision of the trial court, which entered a judgment in a summary proceeding condemning the taxpayer to pay the tax plus a penalty, interest, and attorney's fees. While the taxpayer appealed from the judgment in toto, the court had jurisdiction only of the case insofar as it contested the legality and constitutionality of the penalty imposed and the court's consideration of the case was limited to that particular issue. The court found that there was no constitutional requirement that an excise tax or penalty for failure to pay such must be measured by the value of the property. The court further found that a dealer included anyone who imported cigarettes for consumption or use. Lastly, the contention of the taxpayer that the penalty was confiscatory, oppressive, arbitrary, and excessive was untenable. It was an excise tax on the use and consumption of tobacco and hence need not be measured by the value of the property.</SPAN></P>

A preliminary writ of injunction was issued. Pending appeal, the board of commissioners filed a motion to transfer the case on the ground that the amount in controversy was less than two thousand dollars. In denying the transfer, the court held that appellate jurisdiction was vested in it because the statute under which the commissions of the appointed commissioners were issued was declared unconstitutional, null and void. That conclusion was the only one consistent with the reasoning of the written opinion handed down with the decree.

Consequently, the contractor had to respond in damages to the homeowner for the failure to perform his contract. The surety was liable because its bond with the contractor contemplated damages of that nature. The contractor and the surety were entitled to call the subcontractor in warranty because they alleged the subcontract and the breach thereof. The subcontractor was not prejudiced by its not having been brought into the suit through the third party petition until after the introduction of evidence had begun because it was made a defendant by the homeowner and, as such, it participated in the entire trial of the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant maintained that the grand jury which indicted him for the murder of a white woman was selected so as to systematically exclude African-Americans from serving on it. The court reviewed and examined the procedures used for grand jury selection, finding that the right to a valid grand jury was constitutionally protected. The facts revealed that six out of 75 potential grand juror's were African-American and the court found that the only reason that African-Americans were not selected for grand jury service was because the judge though that the white persons were better qualified. Character, citizenship, availability, education and temperament were all criteria on which grand jurors were selected. A picture of the victim was properly admitted as evidence and the court did not find anything unduly gruesome or revolting about the picture. The court held that a mistrial was not called for even though a witness made a statement alluding to an accomplice which he should not have made. The trial court gave a correct jury charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the judgment from a Louisiana trial court granting defendant's motion to quash an indictment charging him with being in any way interested in a public contract with the Department of Highways as a legislator, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:422, on the grounds that the statute was unconstitutional as violative of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its bill of exception, the State argued that the trial court committed error in finding that the language &quot;in any way interested&quot; was so broad and vague as to be unconstitutional. On review, the court compared other statutes that had fixed meanings to determine if the word interested had any specific definition. After reviewing the dictionary definition for &quot;interested,&quot; the court concluded that the statute's failure to indicate, determine, or define the interest which it sought to prohibit was conspicuously fatal. The court reasoned that a criminal statute, in order to be valid and enforceable, must define the offense so specifically and accurately that any reader having ordinary intelligence will know when or where his conduct is on the one side or the other of the borderline between that which is and that which is not denounced as an offense against the law. As such, the court found &sect; 48:422 to vague to be enforceable and therefore agreed with the trial court that it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owner was convicted and sentenced under Shreveport, La., Ordinance No. 44, &sect; 26.07 (1954), as amended. The ordinance required a permit from the Chief of the Fire Prevention Bureau in order to store combustible materials in any building located within any residential area. The business owner contented that &sect; 26.07 transcended the power of the city in seeking to make it an offense for any person to keep rubbish on his premises within a residential area in contravention of the state statute,&nbsp;La.

The court disagreed, holding that the ordinance did not conflict with the statute, but merely supplemented it to meet the exigencies that might arise to prevent fire hazards. The ordinance was not unreasonable or discriminatory, did not vest arbitrary discretion in the Chief of the Fire Prevention Bureau, and affected all persons similarly situated. The court added that it would have been unreasonable to require the ordinance to list the various articles and quantities of such that may be hazardous because what would be hazardous in one instance might not be in another, depending on the facts and circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect;&sect; 37:1589, 1592, and 1600, the original decree was correct. The court held further that it was sustained in its original position by the legislature itself by the enactment of the amendment to the Watchmaker's Act to correct the defects. The court held that the original statute delegated to the Board of Examiners the freedom to define the standards of workmanship and skill in determining the person or persons to whom licenses should be granted, while the amended Act, required that the Board make rules and regulations that conformed with certain standards spelled out in the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action involved the constitutionality of Act 513 of 1952, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:181-188, which authorized the State Mineral Board to execute mineral leases on lands owned in indivision by 500 or more persons for the benefit of all the owners thereof, when any 50 or more of the co-owners of the property had petitioned the state to lease the subject property. The state received a request and two companies instituted an action and charged that the Act was unconstitutional. Two property owners intervened in the action. The trial court judge found that the Act contravened U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, in that it affected the contract rights of the companies, and declared said Act unconstitutional and permanently enjoined the state. The court held that the Act was designed to benefit the state and all the co-owners affected, and was clearly a valid exercise of the police power. The court noted that only function of the Act was to provide a method for the recovery of minerals in situations where, due to the large number of owners in indivision, exploration and production would otherwise be a practical impossibility.</SPAN></P>

The widow had sought a judgment decreeing her to be the owner of the entire estate left by the decedent as his surviving widow in community and sole heir and ordering that she be sent into possession of it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow and decedent were married. He died intestate, was survived by neither ascendants nor descendants, and left assets consisting entirely of cash and United States bonds. His assets were an accumulation of payments to him by the Federal Government, made over a period of years, because of a disability he sustained during his marriage and as a result of service with the United States Armed Forces. The payments were received while he was married to the widow and their community of acquets and gains was intact. At issue was whether the disability payments made to decedent by the Federal Government constituted pure gratuities such that they were his separate property. The trial court found in favor of decedent's collateral heirs. The court reversed, overruling the exceptions of no right and no cause of action, finding that the payments were not pure gratuities but were for a disability to the decedent and necessarily to the community partnership. The court held the payments belonged to the community of acquets and gains that formerly existed between decedent and his widow such that the widow should inherit them to the exclusion of the collateral heirs.</SPAN></P>

The residents argued that the relevant zoning law was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents sought to enjoin the establishment and operation of a mortuary on the ground that the special use section of the city's zoning ordinance, under City of New Orleans, La., Ordinance 18,565, Comm'n Council Series, was unconstitutional because it failed to prescribe any uniform rule or standard to guide the city council, in order to enable it in deciding whether a special permit should be granted. The residents also alleged that &sect; 18,565 improperly authorized the city to grant or withhold a permit according to its arbitrary decision. The district court denied the residents' application for a preliminary injunction on the basis that construction of a mortuary could not be enjoined on a speculative averment that it would be a nuisance. On appeal, the court noted that record disclosed that the planning board found as a fact that granting of the special use would have an adverse effect on traffic conditions. The court stated that to allow the granting or refusal of special permits by officials without any standard to guide them denied the residents equal protection of the law and the relevant special use section of the zoning law was unconstitutional and invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police jury met, without notice to the landowner, and resolved to take all of the property he owned by expropriation.

The ground was completely leveled by the bulldozers and tractors, and the tools and construction were ploughed under. The court was not impressed with the manner in which the police jury sought to expropriate this property and the speed and haste in which it was accomplished. The record showed the police jury took actual, physical possession, with resistance from the owner, and no payment was made until two weeks later. The court, therefore, found that La. Const. art.

The sellers, who were not parties to that contract, advertised and sold the product at less than the minimum fair trade price. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's grant of injunctive relief to the manufacturer. The sellers contended that the Louisiana Fair Trade Law promoted unconstitutional price fixing. The court held that the Louisiana Fair Trade Law, which made a stipulated resale price binding on all persons with notice, including noncontracting retailers, unconstitutionally delegated to the manufacturer the authority to fix the minimum price of its product, not the legislature. The court held that because state law imposed no restrictions on the use of the manufacturer's products that were acquired in the course of trade by others with whom it was not in privity of contract, the only basis upon which the manufacturer could insist upon compliance with the floor price fixed by it was the Louisiana Fair Trade Law, which unconstitutionally delegated to private entities the legislative power to fix those prices.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's wife and decedent were involved in an altercation outside defendant's presence. Defendant later stabbed decedent to death and was charged with manslaughter. At trial, defendant asserted a plea of self-defense and endeavored to prove the details of the altercation between his wife and decedent. Although the trial judge permitted defendant's wife to testify about the incident, he refused to allow two additional witnesses to provide details regarding the earlier altercation. Defendant appealed his conviction, challenging the trial judge's refusal to admit this evidence. In affirming, the court concluded that the testimony of the witnesses was irrelevant and immaterial because they did not hear the wife relate the incident to defendant, did not know what information she communicated to him, and were not present at the homicide. Defendant was not present at the prior altercation, and his knowledge thereof was limited to the information communicated to him. What he was not told concerning this altercation could not affect his intent and was, accordingly, not relevant to establish the reasonableness of defendant's fear of an impending attack at the time of the homicide.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters sought to enjoin the councilmen-elect from assuming the offices to which they had been elected because they contended that 1952 La. Acts 170, which abolished the police jury system of government for their parish and substituted a commission council for the police jury system, was unconstitutional. The court held that La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 3 imposed a mandate upon the state legislature to provide one or more complete plans of optional government which would be available to any and every parish of the state. It further held that La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 3 did not authorize the legislature to enact a special, tailor-made plan of government for any one particular parish. The court held that 1952 La. Acts 1952 was enacted in disregard of the limitations imposed on the legislature by La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 3 because it was only applicable to one parish. Because it departed from the constitutional scheme embracing the police jury system of parochial government and that of optional or alternate plans made available to any or all parishes, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding that zoning legislation was within the police power of municipal corporations and did not violate any constitutional guarantee unless it was found to be palpably unreasonable and arbitrary. The court found that the property owners purchased the property knowing that it was zoned for residential purposes and that they were given no assurance by anyone connected with the city that the classification would be changed.

He entered a plea of not guilty, demurred, and moved to quash the information on the ground that the statute under which he was charged, particularly La. Rev. Stat. Ann &sect;&sect; 37:1591 and 37:1559, was unconstitutional. The trial court overruled the demurrer and the motion to quash, and defendant was tried, convicted, and sentenced. He appealed, and the appellate court set aside the conviction and sentence, ordering that defendant be discharged. The appellate court held that the statute was unconstitutional. The State appealed, and the court held that the statute was an unlawful delegation of legislative power to the board of examiners in watchmaking. Furthermore, such a delegation of power would have permitted the board, if it desired, to establish a monopoly. Thus, the appellate court's decision was upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with possessing a device manually controlled and operated, without explosives, under circumstances, which indicated that possession was for the purpose of illegally taking commercial fish. Defendants filed two motions to quash. The first motion urged that the statute violated the state constitution because it embraced more than one object, and the title was not broad enough to include the offense. The second motion claimed that the definition of the offense was vague and indefinite. The trial court sustained the first motion to quash and did not rule on the second motion. The State appealed, and the court held that the purpose of the legislation was to regulate the manner and conditions respecting the taking of commercially valuable fish. Thus, the law embraced one object. The several prohibitions and other regulations were germane to, and served as, means for carrying out the purpose and the object. Hence, the statute was not vulnerable to constitutional attack.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by indictment with violation of the state gambling laws. Defendant moved to have the indictment voided on the grounds that it was vague and did not inform him of the charges sufficiently. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant was found guilty. Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in failing to quash the indictment. The court held that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:227, the indictment must state every fact and circumstance necessary to constitute the offense. The court determined that in this case, the indictment merely stated that defendant had violated the state gambling laws and did not adequately explain his offense. The court also observed that a vague indictment could not be cured by a bill of particulars because the constitution mandated prosecution by indictment or information, not a bill of particulars.</SPAN></P>

The night club owner attacked the constitutionality of the ordinance. The trial court overruled his plea and gave judgment to the city. The night club owner appealed. The court held that the amusement tax was not a license tax because it was not imposed as a condition precedent to engaging in business, and the amount varied according to sales. Since the tax was not a license tax, it did not violate La. Const. art. X, &sect; 8. Further, the provisions of the ordinance imposing a tax on refreshments, service, and merchandise at the establishment where the payment or part thereof for admission, refreshment, service or merchandise entitled the patron to be present during any portion of the performance was not an enlargement of the provisions of Act 212 of 1938.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On rehearing, the court was to determine whether the Orleans Levee Board was entitled to 3/16 or 9/48 royalty on production under its lease to plaintiff sublessee, and whether its royalty interest was subject to the 1/48 overriding royalty of defendant sublessor. In the court's original opinion, it upheld the validity of the lease granted by the Grand Prairie Levee District in favor of the sublessor in which the District reserved to itself a 1/8 royalty, forasmuch as Grand Prairie was the record owner of the public lands affected by the lease at the time of its execution. The court held that, because the sublessee subsequently acquired all of the sublessor's leasehold rights under the original lease, save the reservation by the sublessor of a 1/48 overriding royalty, the latter was the only valid outstanding leasehold right to which Orleans Levee Board was subjected. The court held that the Orleans Levee Board was entitled to receive its contractual 3/16 royalty, subject to the 1/48 overriding royalty of the sublessor, or a net royalty of 8/48.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The female defendant was arrested by two police officers while she was alone in a room that she rented in a house.

The court determined that the bill of information fully met the test for determining the sufficiency of an information in that it fully informed the court of the offense charged so that it might properly regulate the evidence sought to be introduced, it informed the accuseds of the nature and cause of the offense with which they were being charged, and it was sufficient on its face to support a plea of former jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the suit did not come within any of the classes of cases enumerated in La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 10. Under La. Sup. Ct. R. X, &sect; 2, plaintiffs' brief was required to affirmatively show jurisdiction in the court. Plaintiffs' brief merely stated that the value of the oil production so reallocated and distributed by such orders was many times $ 2,000, and that the value of their leasehold and mineral interests adversely affected by the orders, was many times $ 2,000. The statement was merely conjectural and was unsworn. Although under prior decisions the court had tolerated the effort to confer jurisdiction by affidavit as to the amount involved, the law had changed to require plaintiffs to affirmatively show what the amount was. Also, it was the amount in dispute at the time the case was submitted to the trial court that determined the court's jurisdiction on appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The common carrier operated a water transportation service which carried commodities all along the Mississippi river system in interstate commerce. The principal claim advanced by the common carrier was an argument that an income tax on its business violated the commerce clause of the federal Constitution because it was a tax on interstate commerce. The court did not agree. It found that the income tax was imposed on income earned within the state of Louisiana an not on the common carrier's right to transport goods on waters located in Louisiana The court determined that the tax was only imposed on that portion of its income which the common carrier derived from its activities within Louisiana. The court stated that interstate commerce can be made to pay its way by bearing a nondiscriminatory share of the tax burden which each state may impose on the activities or properties within its borders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board of Highways, pursuant to 1954 La.

Plaintiffs filed an action seeking a declaration of the rights, responsibilities, duties, and legal relations of the parties as to the bonds. The trial court held that the Department was without authority to issue the bonds because 1954 La. Acts 5 violated La.

On rehearing, the court affirmed that 1954 La. Acts 5 was unconstitutional insofar as it authorized the pledging of the gasoline tax and the segregation of funds for the payment of the bonds. Whether the Department was a distinct corporate entity and whether it could issue bonds that would not constitute an indebtedness of the State were hypothetical, abstract, theoretical, and contingent questions that did not present a justiciable controversy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that defendant's motion in arrest of judgment was founded upon two complaints: (1) that the bill of information should have specifically stated the fact that the parish was dry and that the sale of intoxicating liquors was prohibited in the parish; and (2) that the penalties provided in the parish ordinance under which the prosecution was brought were greater than those authorized by the local option statute of the state. On appeal, the court concluded that contentions made in support of the motion to arrest were untenable. The court stated that the bill of information affirmatively alleged that defendant sold intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes, in violation of the parish ordinance, and that the bill was, therefore, equal to stating that the act committed was prohibited by the specific law charged. The court stated that the bill of information specifically stated the essential and necessary elements of the offense of which defendant was found guilty and was sufficient to sustain the judgment according to the verdict.

Acts 697 (the Act), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

The court affirmed. The state officers lacked the right to question the constitutionality of the Act as a defense to the mandamus proceeding. The district court properly found that the widows were qualified for the pensions. The widows clearly fell within the classification of surviving widows entitled to a pension under &sect; 1 of the Act. Although a literal reading of &sect; 2 of the Act made it impossible for the widows to qualify, the court declined to impose a literal construction on &sect; 2. When &sect; 2 was considered in a broader terms, it was clear that the legislative purpose in providing the additional qualifications was to ensure that a spouse had lived with a judge during a substantial part of his or her judicial tenure and thus, to some extent, had contributed to public service. The widows were qualified because they had lived with each respective judge for almost 40 years prior to each judge's death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the court's grant of certiorari, appellant, the State of Louisiana, sought review of an order of the Court of Appeal, Second Circuit, which reversed the judgment of the trial court, and held that the State's claim for inheritance taxes against appellees, the forced heirs of decedents, who were their parents, prescribed under La. Const. art. XIX, &sect; 19 (1938).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The heirs argued that the inheritance taxes for the decedents' estates prescribed under La. Const. art. XIX, &sect; 19 (1938), which provided for a three-year prescriptive period from the last day of the year in which such taxes were due, because the taxes became due immediately upon the decedents' deaths. The court of appeal reversed the trial court's judgment overruling the plea of prescription. The court reversed, rejecting the heirs' plea of prescription on the basis that the inheritance taxes imposed by 1921 La. Acts. 127 (Act) were not due until a final judgment fixed the amount payable. The court found that although the Act implied that a succession had to be opened within six months of death and provided that taxes would be paid at specified amounts beginning six months after death, the Act did not specify a date upon which an inheritance tax was due. The court held that until the amount due was judicially determined, the inheritance tax was not due and payable and remanded to the court of appeal to review the findings as to the amount of tax due.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff oil well operator brought a concursus proceeding in the district court (Louisiana), depositing certain royalties from the wells into the registry of the court. The claimants to the fund, were defendants, the Orleans Levee District, the Grand Prairie Levee District, a development company, and an intervenor. The district court rejected the claims of the Orleans Levee District, and it appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court recognized the claims of Grand Prairie as the last record owner of the property, and recognized the development company as its lessee, sustaining their claims to the royalties. Setting aside the judgment, the court held that although Grand Prairie was the last record owner, the legislature had granted title of the property to the Orleans district by 1942 La. Acts 311. Both the Orleans Levee Board and the Grand Prairie Levee District were creatures or agencies of the State, and the State could revoke its grant of land to one district and vest title in the other. However, the grant was subject to outstanding leaseholds. The Grand Prairie district had leased a portion of the property to the development company prior to the 1942 act. Therefore, the development company was entitled to receive the royalty reserved by it in its sublease to the operator. Orleans Levee Board, as the present fee owner of the property, was entitled to receive the lessor's royalty reserved in the Grand Prairie lease. Grand Prairie, having been divested of title, was not entitled to any royalty. The court rejected the intervenor's constitutional challenges to 1942 La. Acts 311.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the judgment of the district court and recast it in its entirety, denying all claims of the Grand Prairie Levee District to the royalties and allowing the Orleans Levee District to recover 1/8 of 55 percent of the proceeds and the development company to recover 1/48 of 55 percent of the proceeds. Any surplus was to be returned to the operator.</SPAN></P>

The husband claimed that the New Orleans court had no jurisdiction because the wife had not resided there continuously for two years and the separation was not voluntary because the wife was of unsound mind. The court held that the satisfied the two year residency requirement and the action was properly filed in the trial court in New Orleans. The court held that medical testimony established that the wife was of sound mind at the time of separation, and that it was therefore voluntary and valid. In affirming the judgment, the court held that La. Rev. Stat.

He had also been indicted in federal court on charges of violations of federal statutes in connection with alleged gambling operations. The questions asked of him in connection with the bribery investigation sought information that would be incriminating in the gambling proceedings. The court held that defendant was not entitled to assert the state law privilege against self-incrimination, La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11, because he was protected from prosecution by La. Const. art. 19, &sect; 13, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:468, 14:121, which protected one who assisted the prosecution by testimony in a bribery case. However, the immunity granted by the state constitution covered only state prosecutions and could not be extended to grant immunity to prosecution in federal court. Therefore, because there was an imminent risk of prosecution on the gambling charges, relator was entitled to assert his privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the trial court (Louisiana), which convicted him of manslaughter and sentenced him to three years at hard labor, and which, after remand, corrected the trial court's minutes to show that defendant was present at all stages of the trial and that the legal formalities were observed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant appealed his conviction for manslaughter and his three year sentence, the court remanded the case to determine the accuracy of the trial court's minutes, which did not affirmatively show that defendant was present at all stages of the trial and that the legal formalities were observed. The trial court corrected the minutes to show that there were no defects in the proceedings. On final appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. Parol evidence was admissible at the hearing to correct the minutes. 1950 La. Acts. No. 2, Extra Session, which included the Louisiana Criminal Code under which defendant was charged, did not violate La. Const. art. 3, &sect; 16, because the title declaring the Act's purpose to revise the laws of Louisiana was sufficiently broad to encompass the criminal code. The trial court violated La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 390, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:390, by not giving defendant's requested charge on the State's burden of proof on defendant's claim of self-defense, because the court charged only that defendant was presumed innocent but did advise the jury on the burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union had not been certified by the National Labor Relations Board as required by &sect; 9 of the Labor Management Relations Act.

The court rejected the union's contention that the district court lacked jurisdiction because its organizer had no authority to receive process. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3471(22), the union could be sued in its own name and service could be made upon any official of the organization. The employer's suit was not preempted by the National Labor Relations Act or the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), because the picketing sought to compel the employer to recognize the union although it had no legal status. This was clearly not an act denounced as an unfair labor practice. Because the union had failed to comply with the provisions of &sect; 9(f), (g) and (h) of the LMRA, the National Labor Relations Board had no jurisdiction over the union or the employer dealing with it. The final contention -- that the restraint of the picketing in this case infringed the union's freedom of speech -- was rejected because the picketing was for an unlawful objective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer contended that the taxing power of the board was limited by the 1954 amendment to La. Const. art. 16, &sect; 2. The bondholder contended the amendment impaired the obligation of the contract with the bondholders. The board contended that the amendment merely restricted their taxing power as to levee work and did not restrict it insofar as the bondholders were concerned. Under the provisions of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10, no state could pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts. Under the provisions of La. Const. art. 4, &sect; 15, no law could be passed impairing the obligation of contracts. It was a fundamental principle that laws existing at the time a contract was entered into were incorporated into the contract as though expressly written therein. The court found that the value of the contract could not be diminished by curtailing the taxing power of the board as long as the bonds were outstanding and unpaid. The court held that the constitutional amendment did not limit the taxing power of the board for all purposes.

The trial court determined that the Department of Highways was a corporate entity, distinct from the State of Louisiana, and that the resolution was a violation of La. Const. art.

The court affirmed and held that the legislature could not legally have the authorized bonds paid from the proceeds of a tax contemplated by the provisions of La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 22.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The brother secured a document from the doctor stating that his sister was insane, although the doctor never examined the sister prior to the issuance of the document.

After a preliminary examination, the sister was discharged. Subsequently, the sister commenced an action against defendants seeking damages for wrongful seizure and commitment. The trial court found in the sister's, however, the appellate court found that the doctor was not liable and reduced the amount of damages. The sister sought and was granted certiorari review. The court annulled and set aside the appellate court's judgment absolving the doctor from liable and reduced the amount of damages the sister was entitled to from defendants. The court held the doctor improperly issued a certificate of commitment without first examining the sister, contrary to La. Rev. Stat.

The vendees sought a declaratory judgment relieving them of the responsibility for a sewerage charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vendees were veterans who claimed that when they purchased their homes they were under the impression that everything was paid for &quot;right up to the keys of the front door.&quot; The annual sewerage charge was assessed to retire a 30-year bond issue. The court found that its review of the vendees' prayer made it apparent that the Declaratory Judgment Act of 1948 could not possibly apply. The court noted the misjoinder of parties and the wrongful cumulation of demands. The court held that the right to attack the validity of the bond issue and the sewerage charge was foreclosed because the validity of the election and the bond issue was conclusively presumed after the 60-day period in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:4260 expired. While the police jury did not comply with &sect; 33:4261, the right to oppose the method selected was prescribed by 1946 La. Acts 218, &sect; 10. Further, because the charge did not constitute a lien on the property on which it was assessed, very little hardship was imposed on the vendees. The court held that the vendees were not entitled to a homestead exemption because the sewerage charge was not a tax and was not a lien on the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. All costs were assessed to the vendees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners appealed, by writs of certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus, from a judgment of the Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Cameron (Louisiana), dismissing their action against defendant landowners seeking an injunction prohibiting defendants from committing any further acts of trespass and to have their possession as title owners maintained and quieted. The district court rejected the action based on jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court concluded that according to a survey, the disputed property, which was located on the boundary of two parishes, was actually part of another parish, and, therefore, that the court was without jurisdiction over the matter. Plaintiffs contended that the survey, which was relied on by defendants to support their contention that the disputed property was theirs, constituted a change in the recognized boundary line between both parishes and in so doing ignored and disregarded the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 50:221-50:224. The court found that the register of the state land office, who was authorized to conduct surveys, was not authorized to define, relocate, or change parish boundaries because that would constitute a denial of the statutory rights of parishes in all matters affecting their respective boundaries. The court concluded that until such time as the boundary line separating the parishes was fixed, the district court was in fact vested with jurisdiction over the disputed area. On this basis, the court concluded that the trial court erred in denying jurisdiction over the action.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff alleged that defendant was ineligible to hold office and the votes cast for him were illegal. Defendant filed an exception to the jurisdiction of the trial court rationae materiae.

The court denied the neighboring owners' application for writs but granted them a devolutive appeal after the trial court issued its final judgment. The owners' motion to dismiss the appeal showed that after the judgment, a building permit was issued and construction of a shopping center began. They alleged that the appeal was therefore moot.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union members, agents, and employees engaged in picketing and other activity to prevent the harvest of sugar cane, and, to this end, induced the unionized mill workers to violate their &quot;no strike&quot; contract with the sugar producers. The producers filed suit to enjoin the activities. On appeal from the trial court's injunction, the members, agents, and employees argued that the union was unincorporated and not amenable to service of process and that their activities were protected. In affirming, the court detailed the importance of the sugar industry to the state and the peculiar nature of the state's cane harvest that required completion of the harvest in a short time between ripening and bad weather. To halt the 24-hour operation of the mills during harvest would irreparably damage and destroy the industry, including hundreds of small growers not involved in the dispute. The court held that the guarantees of freedom of speech, even if picketing and speech were identical, could not be maintained in the face of such irreparable injury to property and the economy. The court ruled that service of process on the unincorporated union in the face of such a disaster was proper.</SPAN></P>

Following a hearing wherein the report of the lunacy commission and the testimony of the doctors were adduced, the trial court (Louisiana) found defendant to be presently sane. Defendant was tried and was found guilty as charged. On appeal, defendant challenged the trial court's evidentiary rulings and the process used to seat the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defense counsel was not permitted to cross-examine a member of the lunacy commission to determine his familiarity with a medical treatise. Defendant neither briefed nor argued the bill of exception on the issue. The court opined that if cross-examination was designed to bring before the jury the opinions of the author of the treatise, then the trial court's ruling was correct. Regardless, in view of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:557, a new trial was not warranted on the basis of improper admission or rejection of evidence because there was no show of prejudice to the substantial rights of defendant. No merit was found in a challenge to the manner in which the report of the lunacy commission was placed in evidence. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15: 268 made it incumbent on the trial judge to examine the members of the lunacy commission; if the parties did not summon them, it was not error for the trial court to do so. Finally, even if a juror's name were inadvertently duplicated in the jury box as claimed, it did not constitute grounds for a reversal of defendant's conviction. The juror was fully qualified in all respects to sit in the death penalty case. No trial court errors were found.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State agency sought review of the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Second Circuit (Louisiana), which reversed the decision of the trial court sustaining the State's exception of no right or no cause of action filed in plaintiff widow's suit for the wrongful death of her husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow filed suit and obtained a verdict against the State agency and its employee for her husband's death. Before judgment was entered on the verdict, the trial court sustained the agency's exception and dismissed the suit. The intermediate appellate court reversed. After the court granted the agency a writ of review, the legislature enacted private legislation, 1954 La. Acts 243 and 1954 La. Acts 244, retroactively waiving immunity for the widow's claim and appropriating the amount of the verdict. In its appeal, the agency argued that the retroactive operation of 1954 La. Acts 243 was unconstitutional. In affirming, the court ruled that, although well-established constitutional principles required statutes to be construed prospectively only, the language of the private act clearly intended retroactive application. The court held that so long as a retrospective statute did not impair the obligations of contracts, did not divest vested rights, and was not an ex post facto law, it did not contravene La. Const. art. 4, &sect; 15 and that, under that test, 1954 La. Acts 243 was not unconstitutional and conformed to the requirements of La. Const. art. 3, &sect; 35.</SPAN></P>

In response, the applicant filed suit attacking the validity of the ordinance. The trial court rejected the applicant's demands. Before his appeals were perfected, however, a warrant for his arrest was issued. Consequently, he applied for the writs. The court recalled and rescinded the writs and affirmed the judgment rejecting the applicant's demands because the municipality was empowered to enter into the contract for airport services, and the object of the ordinance was to protect the right granted by the contract.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 4:148, 4:153, 4:156, and 4:159.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the developer obtained a license to operate a harness racing track and conduct pari-mutuel betting, the landowners and taxpayers, joined by 47 intervenors, prosecuted a suit to revoke the license and enjoin betting activity. On appeal from the trial court's dismissal, they argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 4:148, 4:153, 4:156, and 4:159 violated La. Const. of 1921, art. 19, &sect; 8 and La. Rev. Stat.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 4:141 to 4:161 referred to wagering on races in particular and constituted an exception to the general rule stated in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:90. The court held that La. Rev.

The court further held that the provision of &sect; 8, requiring the legislature to pass laws to suppress the vice of gambling, was not self-operative and that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 4:141 to 4:161 were not unconstitutional as violative of La. Const. of 1921, art. 19, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board intended to investigate several firemen and policemen for allegedly coercing the safety commissioner. Prior to the investigation, the district court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the investigation. The court of appeal reversed. On review, the policemen and firemen asserted that that the Board's power to investigate was restricted to matters involving the administration of civil service personnel and that the Board was precluded from examining conduct except in a complaint by an appointing authority. The policemen and firemen also contended that such and investigation, if allowed, was required to be conducted in private. The court found that La. Const. art. 14, &sect; 15.1, conferred upon the Board the privilege to investigate the conduct and performance of any classified employee, even though no action complaint had been taken by the appointing authority. Furthermore, the investigation was not required to be conducted in private because the policemen and foremen were public servants and the investigation was a matter of public interest.</SPAN></P>

The sub-district reorganized itself and again sought to sell the bonds. After it reached agreement with an underwriter and prepared the bonds for issuance, the taxpayer filed suit to enjoin the sale. In support of its appeal of the trial court's judgment, the sub-sewerage district argued that the taxpayer's suit was prescribed by La. Const. of 1921, art. XIV, &sect; 14(n). In reversing, the court rejected the trial court's ruling that &sect; 14(n) was applicable only to some defect or &quot;minor informality&quot; in the handling of the election. The court reviewed the precedents and held that the 60-day limitation prescribed in &sect; 14(n) was not restricted to cases involving mere irregularities but that it applied to all cases, including those in which the election was attacked on the basis of the illegality or constitutionality of the statutes or ordinances under which it had been called and held.</SPAN></P>

The city adopted a new zoning ordinance, which changed the zoning of defendants' building to a neighborhood shopping district. The trial court dissolved the injunction after a hearing on the corporation's rule to show cause. On appeal, the property owners argued that the dissolving of the preliminary injunction was incorrect because the new zoning ordinance had a savings clause that made it inapplicable to pending cases and that the corporation's building failed to comply with the New Orleans Building Code. The court affirmed. The court held that the new ordinance merely provided that any previous zoning violations were not changed by the ordinance and that the corporation remained liable for any penalties incurred under the former zoning law. The court rejected the arguments that defendants were permanently prohibited from using the building as a theatre or that they failed to comply with the new zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that 1952 La. Acts 327 was unconstitutional and violated La. Const. of 1921, art. 19, &sect; 8, in that the Louisiana Legislature could not give to the cities the power to create and define offenses since such power could not be validly delegated. The court disagreed as (1) 1952 La. Acts 327 was enacted in furtherance of the constitutional mandate that the Legislature pass laws prohibiting gambling; (2) the Act gave municipalities the power to pass such laws; and (3) implied in such power was the right to determine what means might be appropriate to accomplish such purpose. The court also held that (1) Lake Charles, La., Mun. Code &sect; 945, was not null and void for being vague as it required that the possession of gambling paraphernalia be used or kept and used for gambling; (2) it was not in conflict with the law as 1952 La. Acts 327 expressly provided that municipalities had such power; (3) it did not violate La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer contended that, during the course of defendants' strike, defendants trespassed on the employer's property, threatened the employer's customers and employees, and committed acts of vandalism.

The Louisiana Supreme Court held that, assuming that the employer's allegations were true, the state courts were fully authorized to provide injunctive relief. Federal preemption did not apply because the LMRA did not provide any federal power to enjoin illegal picketing and thus left policing of such conduct to the states. Further, the state courts were empowered by the Louisiana Constitution to issue necessary injunctions for the protection of rights and property, and the anti-injunction statute, as a legislative act, could not limit the courts' constitutional jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were owners and operators of two separate bars in the City of Baton Rouge. Defendants appealed the judgments of the City Court of Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which convicted them of violating the provisions of a city ordinance by keeping their bars open for business on a Sunday. The cases were consolidated on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the ordinance was (1) unconstitutional; (2) ultra vires because it conflicted with the term &quot;closed&quot; as used in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:191; and (3) illegal because it was an arbitrary and capricious definition. The state supreme court concluded that the ordinance, by inclusion of the paragraph defining the term &quot;closed,&quot; provided simply that all shops, stores, etc., licensed under its provisions should be closed and remain closed continuously during the specified hours. The purpose of the ordinance was to facilitate law enforcement by defining what constituted the condition of being closed. Also, there was no merit in the contention that the municipality was without authority to enlarge La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:191 by defining the word &quot;closed.&quot; Power was specifically delegated by the legislature to the city council, under the provisions of the city charter, to pass ordinances on all subject matters in connection with the exercise of general police powers subject only to the limitation that the provisions of said ordinances should not directly conflict with the provisions of any state law upon the same subject matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant one robbed a man while defendant two dragged the man's companion into an alley and, with defendant one's help, raped her. The supreme court held that, as the State did not offer defendant one's written confession, he had not been entitled to inspect it before trial. The answer to defendant one's motion for a bill of particulars gave him all information need for a proper defense. Defendants' claims that blacks were excluded from the grand jury had not been timely filed under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 202, and art. 202 did not violate equal protection or due process. That defendant two had been a fugitive did not excuse compliance with art. 202. As defendants did not present conflicting or antagonistic defenses, denial of a severance was not error. That a State's witness, unbidden, referred to defendant one's confession did not require a mistrial, as the trial judge instructed the jury to disregard the remark. The rape victim's outcry was admissible under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 447 as part of the res gestae. The State's remarks in closing argument were proper comments on the evidence. The trial court did not err in rejecting proffered jury instructions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by an indictment with the offense, for which he was tried, convicted, and sentenced to serve one year in jail. On appeal, defendant contended that it was error to overrule his motion to quash the indictment. The court held that Article 81 of the Louisiana Criminal Code, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81, was constitutional, because the provisions therein were sufficiently definite and certain. The court also upheld the trial court's ruling that the child victim of the crime was a competent witness. He was seven years old at the time of the trial, was shown to have a sufficient understanding of the obligations as a witness, and was found to be well qualified. The court concluded that there was no manifest error in the trial court's finding as to the victim's competency. Lastly, the court held that the decision to overrule defendant's motion for a new trial was proper, where, upon a finding that the victim was a competent witness, it was admitted that the motion lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Venturing to supplement what had been so well said in the majority opinion on the question of the jurisdiction and power of the district court to enjoin the enforcement of the regulation enacted under the police power of the municipality, the Louisiana Supreme Court emphasized the distinction or differentiation which the capable judge apparently overlooked, and that was that a preliminary injunction would not be granted unless there was found three concurring conditions, to wit: The invasion of a property right had to have been clearly shown; the unconstitutionality or illegality of the ordinance had to have been manifest; and the judge had to have been satisfied that the applicant was threatened with irreparable injury, against which the law, as administered in the courts vested with jurisdiction of the prosecution, afforded no adequate remedy. In fact, so careful were the framers of the organic law in protecting the scope and extent of the police power of a town, city, or the state itself that they issued an admonition to the courts which was contained in La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patent holders sued defendant State and others, claiming that their patent covering a part of the bed of Grand Bay, a navigable body of salt water connecting with the Gulf of Mexico, on which several oil wells were located, were valid. The matter was before the appeals court for a rehearing of its decision that such patents were valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the patent was invalid as to that part embracing the bed of Grand Bay, because the bottoms of navigable waters were public things and were not susceptible of private ownership. The appeals court originally rejected this contention under 1912 La. Acts 62, which barred all proceedings to vacate any patent duly signed by the Governor and Register of the State Land Office and of record in the State Land Office, unless brought within six years from the passage of the statute, with respect to patents issued previous thereto. On rehearing, the court held that (1) water bottoms were not unsusceptible to private ownership; (2) river bottoms fell within the class of things that could lose that quality by being applied to some public purpose under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 482; (3) even if the Governor and Register were without authority to make the conveyance, the Louisiana Legislature had the right to sanction it as there was no constitutional restraint on such power prior to the adoption of the La. Const. of 1921; and (4) the State did not move to annul the patent within the six years provided, so the patents were unassailable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant took a bill of exception after the trial court overruled a plea to the jurisdiction ratione personae and a motion for allotment.

Const. art. 7, &sect; 86, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1343, and Crim. Dist. Ct. R. 6, &sect; 2. Defendant's previous conviction was set aside and the new bill of information was filed. The court observed that it appeared that the allotments in the Criminal District Court were made on the original affidavit and that the bill of information was based on and followed the allotment of the original affidavit. There was no apparent error in the allotment, and defendant apparently suffered no injury by the allotment method used. As such, the court would not have been warranted in setting aside the conviction and sentence. The court also rejected defendant's constitutional challenge to La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted of attempting to possess narcotics and of being a double offender, argued trial court error in overruling his motion to quash the bill of information on grounds that &sect; La.

The court disagreed, ruling that the issue was previously considered and held to be without merit. Moreover, the trial court did not err in refusing defendant's requested instruction to the jury that it could only convict him if the narcotics were found to be in his &quot;exclusive possession.&quot; Noting that joint ownership or control was sufficient to prove defendant's guilt, the court ruled that the trial court properly allowed the greater part of the requested instructions to go to the jury and denied only the &quot;exclusive possession&quot; portion. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:390, a trial judge was only obligated to give requested charges that were wholly correct, and not to give misleading charges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A decedent's will was filed, registered, and executed. Plaintiff, allegedly the decedent's adopted son, sought a reduction of the legacy to the widow, contending that he was entitled to his legitime as the adopted child and forced heir of the decedent. The district court (Louisiana) recognized the son as the decedent's forced heir and awarded him one-third of the separate property and one sixth of the community property. Defendant widow appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The allegedly adopted son was born to the decedent's brother and sister-in-law, who were then living in the decedent's home with the decedent and his wife. The decedent and his wife adopted the child by notarial act when he was seven years old. When he was 15, the son's natural parents instituted adoption proceedings under 1938 La. Acts 428, and the child was decreed to be the adopted child of his natural parents. Affirming, the court held that when the status of parent and child was created by the decedent's adoption of the son, certain legal rights and obligations ensued, including the right to his parents' estates under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 214. There was nothing in article 214 which provided for any way to undo these rights. The statement in 1938 La. Acts 428 that, upon adoption, the &quot;child shall cease to be heir of its parents,&quot; if effective, was a substantive change in the law and was not reflected in the title of the act, in violation of La. Const. art. 3, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer, a foreign corporation, appealed from the judgment of the district court (Louisiana), which dismissed its suit. The taxpayer had filed suit against defendant state tax collector to recover corporate franchise taxes, which it paid in protest. The district court upheld the tax collector's interpretation of the Corporation Franchise Tax Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:601 et seq., and its method of applying the tax thereunder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a holding company in the pipeline business, contended that certain intangible property, which it owned, including revenues, investments, and bank deposits, was improperly allocated to Louisiana under the Corporation Franchise Tax Act (Act), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:601 et seq., as it was domiciled in Delaware. It urged that the movables followed the owner. Yet it maintained its principal office in Louisiana, where its officers resided. From such office it collected its revenues and kept deposits in Louisiana banks during the years in question, from which it paid dividends to its stockholders, as well as salaries and expenses. The court affirmed the judgment of the district court, dismissing the taxpayer's suit against the state tax collector, as the allocation of the aforementioned intangibles was in accordance with the Act. The court found that the taxpayer had established a commercial domicile in Louisiana. Also, in applying the allocation formula under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:606(B), the tax collector had not attempted to allocate all of the taxpayer's intangibles, but only a portion equal to the percentage of capital employed in Louisiana by its subsidiaries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the district court, which upheld the state tax collector's method of applying the Corporation Franchise Tax Act. Costs of the appeal were assessed to the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
