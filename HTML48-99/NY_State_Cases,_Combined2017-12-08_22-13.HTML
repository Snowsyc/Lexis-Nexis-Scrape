</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The placement of a minor in need of supervision came before the court for its consideration after the Division of Youth rejected him from placement in its facility pursuant to its authority under N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 502, subd. 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A minor was found to be a Person In Need of Supervision (PINS), and the recommendation was made that he be placed in a Division of Youth facility. The Division of Youth, however, rejected the PINS youth pursuant to its discretion under N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 502(4) to refuse to admit a youth if admission was not in the youth's best interest. Due to the dilemma in finding suitable placement for the youth, the matter came before the court for its consideration. The court directed that the youth's placement be with the Division of Youth as it was in his best interests because it afforded him the best opportunity to receive the treatment to which he was entitled. In arriving at that decision, the court declared N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 502(4)&nbsp;unconstitutional as violating due process since it was broad, vague, and did not provide adequate standards for the guidance of Division of Youth in applying the statute. This statute was also held to have been superseded by subsequent legislation as well. Furthermore, the refusal by the Division of Youth in accepting the youth was found to be arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable since there was no good cause shown for rejecting the youth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court directed placement of the PINS youth with the Division of Youth as it was in his best interests. In holding so, the state executive law that the Division of Youth relied upon in initially refusing to admit the youth was declared as unconstitutional since it violated due process and was superseded by subsequent legislation. The court also found that said refusal was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. There is a strong presumption that a statute duly enacted is valid; a court is not bound to set aside a law as unconstitutional unless that conclusion is inescapable and demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt by the one asserting it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In interpreting penal statutes the words thereof are afforded their commonly accepted meaning; a penal law is void for vagueness when it fails to give fair notice of the proscribed conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the acting superintendent of a correctional facility, asked the court to designate physicians to examine two prisoners pursuant to N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 402(1). The prisoners had already been transferred to a psychiatric center pursuant to the emergency provisions of N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 402(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 402(9) an inmate of a correctional facility could be admitted on an emergency basis to a designated psychiatric center upon the certification of two of the center's physicians. Section 402(1) provided that before a transfer from a correctional facility to a mental health facility was made, a prisoner was entitled to court review. The court held that the prisoners were entitled to the minimum procedural due process protections set out in &sect; 402(1). The court ruled that because &sect; 402(9) failed to define emergency, or to provide for any input from outside the mental health facility, it failed to provide the necessary minimum due process. The fact that &sect; 402(9) provided for review following the transfer was not sufficient because the statute was to protect the individual from unconstitutional discretion by public officials. Because &sect; 402(9) attempted to circumvent the procedural due process protections of &sect; 402(1), it could not be upheld. The State's argument regarding procedures for civil commitment was irrelevant because the prisoners were already in custody and could be isolated and protected until they could be properly transferred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the superintendent's application to designate physicians to examine two prisoners who had been transferred to a psychiatric center and ordered that the prisoners be returned to the prison where they had been incarcerated for such action as was deemed appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 9 of section 402 of the Correction Law, which provides that an inmate of a correctional facility may be admitted on an emergency basis to the Central New York Psychiatric Center upon the certification by two examining physicians associated with the correctional facility that he suffers from a mental illness that is likely to result in serious harm to himself or others, fails to provide adequate due process safeguards for the inmate and cannot be reconciled with other provisions of that section which provide that, whenever the physician of any correctional facility shall report to the superintendent that an inmate is mentally ill, the superintendent shall apply to a Judge of the County Court or Justice of the Supreme Court in the county for appointment of two examining physicians (subd 1) and which authorize the court to transfer the inmate forthwith, prior to hearing if there is proof&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the correctional facility cannot adequately care for him (subd 8).</SPAN></P>

A protected right is involved in a transfer of an inmate from a correctional facility to a mental health facility, and, prior to such a transfer, the inmate must be afforded procedural due process protection; subdivision 9 of section 402 of the Correction Law, which permits a correctional facility to effect such a transfer on an &quot;emergency&quot; basis, without defining an &quot;emergency&quot; and without providing for any input or control from outside the correctional facility, attempts to circumvent that right, is inconsistent with other provisions of the section which require examination of the inmate by court-appointed physicians prior to such a transfer, and cannot be upheld.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after two police officers observed him place two bags of trash at the curb in front of the store where he worked. The evidence at trial indicated defendant walked away from the officers and did not heed their request for identification. Additionally, defendant sought refuge in the store and barred the officers' entry into the store. In his motion to dismiss, defendant asserted the information charging obstruction was insufficient. Also in the motion to dismiss, defendant claimed that the existence of two almost identical statutes proscribing littering, with great disparity in authorized punishment and with no guidelines for the application of either, violated his rights of equal protection and due process. The court first found defendant had not been charged with a crime because fleeing from an officer prior to arrest was not obstructing governmental administration as charged. However, the court held the littering charge was proper considering the presumed constitutionality of statutes and ordinances and the reservation of such questions for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

Because it was impossible to determine exactly how much marihuana was involved, the court dismissed the possession count to the extent it contemplated possession of more than a pound of marihuana and reduced it to mere possession of any amount of marihuana under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 221.05. The court denied the motion to dismiss or reduce the sale count because scientific proof of pure weight was not an element of sale by offer under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 221.55. An offer to sell could be established circumstantially. It was sufficient that defendant made and carried out an offer to deliver of nine pounds of a substance, accompanied by representations that it was marihuana.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1973 defendant was arrested and charged with menacing, a class B misdemeanor, in violation of N.Y.

A one judge trial was conducted and a verdict of guilty on all counts was rendered. Defendant never filed a notice of appeal subsequent to his resentencing. Five years after his conviction, defendant claimed that his constitutional right to a jury trial was denied him and that the procedural infirmity mandated that his conviction be set aside under either N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.10(1)(a) or (h). The court stated that there was no doubt that defendant was entitled to a jury trial in 1973. His right to a jury trial was subject to divestiture by an affirmative waiver only. For some reason not readily apparent, defendant was never asked to execute such a waiver at any time and never did execute one. The court held that although defendant's rights were violated in 1973, his opportunity to assert the rights was never substantially impaired.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 170.70 of the Penal Law, concerning illegal possession of a vehicle identification number plate, is not pre-empted by Federal statute, as while vehicle identification numbers are specified as part of the Federal standards established by Congress to promote motor safety (US Code, tit 15, &sect; 1381 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it does not necessarily follow that this area has been pre-empted by the &quot;Safety Act&quot; in that the promulgation of the safety standards cannot be said to be so pervasive of the area to prevent the State of New York from enacting and enforcing laws with respect to the illegal possession of vehicle identification&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  number plates in aid of the effort to reduce the incidence of theft of motor vehicles or enhance powers of enforcement of the laws with respect thereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Pre-Emption Doctrine</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 170.70 of the Penal Law, concerning illegal possession of a vehicle identification number plate, is not unconstitutionally vague as its purpose and language are consistent with the Federal &quot;Safety Act&quot;.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Reaching Issue of Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. While a statutory enactment is presumed constitutional and will be struck down only when its &quot;unconstitutionality is shown beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; and courts of first instance particularly should not exercise transcendent power of declaring a statutory enactment unconstitutional except in rare cases where life and liberty are involved and the invalidity of the act is apparent on its face and the conclusion of unconstitutionality is inescapable, when, however, courts of original jurisdiction are unavoidably confronted with the issue of constitutionality, such as where a potential deprivation of liberty is at stake requiring a &quot;leap&quot; in judicial reasoning, they are morally and legally bound to consider it and rule accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Right to Trial by Jury</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The right to trial by jury, as transferred from the Sixth Amendment to the Fourteenth Amendment applicable to the separate States, exists in absolute form equal to but separate from the other classic &quot;due process&quot; rights so that the right to trial by jury is applicable to all crimes, felonies or misdemeanors where a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sentence in excess of six months might be handed down regardless of the niceties of language used by the individual States to describe them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Right of Mandatory Youthful Offender to Trial by Jury</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  CPL 340.40 (subd 7), which denies trial by jury to a youth who is eligible for mandatory youthful offender treatment at the same time this right is available to any other defendant including a discretionary youthful offender who is charged with the same crime, is unconstitutional since the crimes charged are &quot;serious&quot; rather than &quot;petty&quot; within constitutional criteria thus mandating trial by jury regardless of the six-month maximum period of incarceration upon a mandatory youthful offender adjudication.  Since the ultimate sentence imposed does not, a fortiori, define the nature of the crime, a crime may be designated as &quot;serious&quot; requiring a jury trial even where a six-month sentence is not imposed by statute such as where the crime itself is morally offensive or in the case of drunken driving, where the accused, in addition to a maximum six-month sentence, is also subject to the loss or suspension of his driver's license, a fine and community criticism, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  having a substantial impact not only on the accused's liberty, but upon his financial resources, travel and occupation as well.  The nature of the crimes cannot be changed nor can the moral condemnation of society and the stigma of conviction be diluted simply by trimming some time off the prescribed sentences by sleight of hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Right of Mandatory Youthful Offender to Trial by Jury</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  CPL 340.40 (subd 7), which denies trial by jury to a youth who is eligible for mandatory youthful offender treatment at the same time this right is available to any other defendant including a discretionary youthful offender who is charged with the same crime, is unconstitutional in that it permits the mandatory youthful offender finding for a first conviction to serve as a predicate or basis for denial of youthful offender status in a future prosecution.  (see CPL 720.10 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) without a constitutionally mandated trial by jury in violation of the predicate felony statute ( CPL 400.21) which requires that a previous conviction be constitutionally rendered before serving as a predicate crime, and contrary to the primary purpose of the youthful offender law of preventing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the imposition of increased punishment on a subsequent conviction of the defendant of a crime.  The special classification of youth versus adult which can justify the denial of trial by jury to a youthful offender is not applicable since, in reality, the classes matched against each other under the statutory scheme are youths with no convictions as against youths with prior convictions.  The State may not constitutionally move a youth from one category to another on the basis of State action via court proceedings which deny the right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Right to Treatment in Juvenile Justice System</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Where a State guarantees benevolent treatment to a classified group, and thereby deprives an individual of liberty for any period however brief through proceedings which lack full constitutional due process protections such as the commitment of mental defectives, the involuntary commitment of persons acquitted of criminal offenses by reason of insanity, and the commitment of youths by judicial proceedings which are constitutionally defective in that they lack trial by jury, it is under a positive obligation to furnish treatment.  When a State deprives an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  individual of liberty in the name of treatment and fails to furnish it, the cause or pretense of detention becomes illusory thus rendering further confinement constitutionally unlawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Right to Treatment in Juvenile Justice System</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Since the constitutional validity of procedural safeguards in juvenile adjudications, which do not embrace all of the rigorous due process safeguards of criminal court adjudications, rests on the adherence of the juvenile justice system to rehabilitative rather than penal goals giving rise to a positive obligation on the part of the State to furnish treatment where it commits a youth in an otherwise constitutionally defective proceeding, New York's youthful offender statute ( CPL 340.40, subd 7), which denies trial by jury to a youth who is eligible for mandatory youthful offender treatment at the same time this right is available to any other defendant including a discretionary youthful offender charged with the same crime and which provides for benign handling of youthful offenders, is constitutionally defective for totally failing to provide constitutionally mandated treatment as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">quid pro quo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for denial of trial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Right of Mandatory Youthful Offender to Trial by Jury</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The fact that there is a valid basis for classification between adults and young persons does not serve a basis to uphold the constitutionality of New York's youthful offender statute ( CPL 340.40, subd 7), which denies trial by jury to a youth who is eligible for mandatory youthful offender treatment at the same time this right is available to any other defendant including a discretionary youthful offender who is charged with the same crime, since, when one young person commits the same alleged act committed by another youth of the same age and is tried without a jury only because his proposed youthful offender status is mandatory upon conviction as opposed to the other's discretionary status because of a prior record, it is not young person against adult which is the classification under constitutional attack, but rather young person without a record as against young person with a record.  </SPAN></P>

Petitioner claimed that respondent exceeded his authorized powers by rescinding the order granting the reduction of the charge against petitioner. The court granted petitioner's application since respondent exceeded his authority by rescinding the order granting the reduction of the charge against petitioner.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Order Regarding Reduction of Charge Pursuant to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPL 180.50</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A judgment prohibiting the enforcement of an order of respondent, a District Court Judge, which rescinded an earlier order by respondent that had granted an application pursuant to CPL 180.50 reducing the criminal charge against petitioner, is properly granted as the respondent Judge, under such circumstances, lacked the power to issue an order that rescinded his earlier order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against Body or Officer -- Prohibition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A CPLR article 78 proceeding in the nature of prohibition is a proper remedy under circumstances where petitioner claims that respondent, a Judge, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is acting beyond his jurisdiction and is thereby exceeding his authorized powers in a proceeding over which he has jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Reduction of Felony Complaint to Misdemeanor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  CPL 180.40 is not rendered unconstitutional by the fact that a felony complaint, prior to its being submitted to the Grand Jury, may be returned by a superior court to a lower court for reconsideration and upon such reconsideration the matter is prosecuted as a misdemeanor, as section 6 of article I of the New York State Constitution mandates Grand Jury action only for capital and otherwise infamous crimes and thus misdemeanors do not come within the purview of that section; moreover, CPL 180.40 involves only a preliminary proceeding and no State constitutional language or case law requires that matters preliminary to a potential felony indictment be conducted or processed only after a Grand Jury proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Where Grand Jury Action Required</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  CPL 180.40 does not violate the due process clause of the Federal Constitution as Grand Jury action is guaranteed only for capital and other infamous crimes and not for misdemeanors; moreover, such clause is inapplicable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to criminal prosecutions in State courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Presumption of Constitutionality</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Reduction of Charge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  CPL 180.40 is not rendered unenforceable by the mandatory language of CPL 190.55 (subd 2, par [a]) as the two statutes must be read together, and as so construed, mean that the District Attorney must present a pending felony complaint to the Grand Jury unless the case is returned to the lower court for reconsideration and upon such reconsideration the matter is prosecuted as a misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Reduction of Charge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  CPL 180.40 does not improperly permit the District Attorney a unilateral review of a local criminal court's action regarding a pending felony complaint as the District Attorney is not authorized to reduce the pending felony to a misdemeanor but is authorized only to apply to a superior court which is then empowered to request the lower court to reconsider its decision.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner city filed a motion for summary judgment in its action against respondent state to recover interest the city paid to persons whose property had been taken by the city by condemnation under N.Y. High. Law &sect; 340-b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city filed an action seeking reimbursement from the state for interest in excess of one year, which it had paid to persons whose property the city had taken by condemnation. During the city's pending action, the appellate court held in a similar action that all interest paid by the city was recoverable. The city then filed a motion for summary judgment in view of the appellate court's decision. The state opposed the motion's amount of damages and the city's request for prejudgment interest on the damages. The state stipulated its liability on a large portion of the amount requested by the city, leaving a small portion in dispute. The court granted partial summary judgment for the stipulated amount and held that the state was collaterally estopped from raising the issue of prejudgment interest, that awarding interest on money the city was entitled to over 10 years ago did no more than compensate the city for the state's wrongful withholding and that an award of interest from the date of filing the claim was mandatory and would fully compensate the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court awarded partial summary judgment to the city in its action to recover from the state interest the city had paid when taking property by condemnation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Damages -- Waiver of Right to Contest Amount of Damages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Where a city's claim against the State for reimbursement of interest paid on certain condemnation awards was filed at a time when the Court of Claims Act did not require the State to put in an answer, and the claim was originally dismissed on jurisdictional grounds only, but, on appeal, the State was held liable to the city and the case was remitted for further proceedings, the issue of the city's damages did not become material until that finding of liability was made, and, accordingly, the State's failure to contest the amount of those damages prior to that time did not constitute a waiver of its right to do so in the subsequent proceedings on the claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments -- Collateral Estoppel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The doctrine of collateral estoppel, as traditionally stated, precludes the relitigation of an issue of fact or law which was necessarily determined in a prior action between the same parties or those in privity with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments -- Collateral Estoppel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The two necessary requirements&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel are (1) an identity of issue which has necessarily been decided in the prior action and which is decisive of the present one, and (2) a full and fair opportunity to contest the decision now said to be controlling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Interest -- Entitlement to Interest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. An award of a specific amount of interest necessarily presupposes a finding of a party's entitlement to interest, just as an award of damages necessarily entails a finding of liability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments -- Collateral Estoppel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Where, after the State was held liable on one of a number of pending claims by a city for reimbursement of interest paid on certain condemnation awards, it fully litigated the question of what interest rate was applicable to the judgment awarded by the court, and that judgment made provision for prejudgment interest, the State is collaterally estopped from raising the issue of the city's entitlement to prejudgment interest on another of the city's claims for the identical relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Interest -- Award of Prejudgment Interest on Claim for Interest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. An award of prejudgment interest on damages awarded to a city on a claim by it against&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the State for reimbursement of interest paid on certain condemnation awards is not against public policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Interest -- Award of Interest against State</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The prohibition against awarding interest against a governmental entity is simply an element of sovereign immunity which has been waived in this State by virtue of the Court of Claims Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Interest -- Award of Interest against State</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Permission to prosecute a claim in the Court of Claims has been construed, in the absence of restrictive provisions respecting interest, to permit the award of interest to be determined as a matter of discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Power of Court of Claims to Award Interest</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prisoner filed a motion for a declaratory judgment seeking to declare N.Y. Civ.

Defendant warden filed a motion to dismiss the prisoner's action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was serving a sentence of three years to life upon her conviction of a class A-III felony. She requested permission to be married from the superintendent of the correctional facility where she was serving her life sentence. The department of corrections denied her request pursuant to &sect; 79-a. The prisoner argued that the right to marry was fundamental and could not be denied without a showing by the State that such a restriction was necessary to promote a compelling State interest. The prisoner also argued that preventing the right to marry violated the equal protection guarantees. The court found that the State's interest in regulating the question of marriage did not constitute a denial of equal protection. The court also found that the statute did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Therefore, the prisoner failed to meet the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of &sect; 79-a.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Presumption of Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Every legislative enactment carries a strong presumption of constitutionality including a rebuttable presumption of the existence of necessary factual support for its provisions.  If any state of facts, known or to be assumed, justifies the law, the court's power of inquiry ends; questions as to wisdom, need or appropriateness are for the Legislature, and courts strike down statutes only as a last resort when unconstitutionality is shown beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection -- Identity of Treatment not Required</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The equal protection clause&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the New York State Constitution (art I, &sect; 11) does not require identity of treatment; the Legislature may classify persons for purposes of legislation without infringement of the equal protection guarantee and its discretion in this regard is broad and will not be disturbed if any state of facts can reasonably be conceived to sustain its classification or even if the classification be fairly debatable, provided only it shall not be palpably arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Prisons and Prisoners -- Ban on Marriage for Prisoner with Life Term</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. When a prisoner has been convicted pursuant to a trial in which full due process safeguards have been accorded, incarceration is not the only consequence which can be lawfully imposed following sentence; the prohibition against marriage contained in section 79-a of the Civil Rights Law for those who have been convicted and sentenced for life imprisonment is neither a denial of equal protection nor cruel and unusual punishment; accordingly, since the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of section 79-a has not been met, a motion to dismiss the complaint is granted.  </SPAN></P>

The court determined that the charge of rape in the third degree, under &sect; 130.25, addressed an age disparity between the parties that was determined to have justified the classification.

New York penal statutes under which a defendant was charged with sexual misconduct (Penal Law, &sect; 130.20, subd 1) and rape in the first degree (Penal Law, &sect; 130.35) deal with nonconsensual acts involving the use of force to some degree.

The age disparity in the definition of rape in the third degree, or statutory rape, which requires that the male be 21 years of age or over and the female less than 17 years of age (Penal Law, &sect; 130.25) is sufficient to justify the gender classification and, accordingly, the statute is not unconstitutional as being violative of the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 165.15 provided that proof that a meter had been tampered with shall be presumptive evidence that the person to whom the service was being furnished had created the condition so existing. Thus, whenever a meter had been tampered with, the statute permitted the trier of fact to conclude that the tampering was done by the person who received the metered service. The court held that a presumption in a criminal case must satisfy the &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; standard. The court concluded that because the presumed fact did not flow from the established fact beyond a reasonable doubt, its use in a criminal case was constitutionally impermissible. Therefore, the court held that &sect; 165.15(6) was constitutionally defective under the due process clause. Accordingly, the court granted defendants' motions to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A presumption in a criminal case, which serves to supply an element of the crime charged, must satisfy the reasonable doubt standard as the due process clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime; accordingly, the recent amendment to section 165.15 of the Penal Law concerning theft of services, which provides that proof that a utility meter has been tampered with shall be presumptive evidence that the person to whom the service is being furnished has created the condition, is constitutionally defective, as while it may be likely or probable that a defendant has the requisite knowledge of the condition, this likelihood or probability is not certainty beyond a reasonable doubt and the fact that the presumption is rebuttable does not make it any less impermissible, as a presumption that permits the jury to find an element of the offense when it has not been established independently beyond a reasonable doubt is alone sufficient to invalidate the statute.  </SPAN></P>

The district attorney issued a release. The volunteer ambulance corps made a demand on the property clerk for release of the money. The property clerk refused to release the money and did not institute a forfeiture proceeding. The volunteer ambulance corps then filed this replevin action. The court granted its motion for summary judgment and found that it was entitled to have the money returned. The court concluded that the property clerk could not claim any legal interest in the property if it was not contraband.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit for a permanent injunction against defendants insurance company and publishers to restrain the publication of advertising which implied that large damage awards in personal injury actions were often unrelated to the extent of the injury, plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction, and defendants sought to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. U.S. Const. amend. I, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 350-a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, three women, each of whom was also a plaintiff in a personal injury action, sued to restrain the publication of two advertisements entitled &quot;Too Bad Judges Can't Read This to a Jury&quot; and &quot;And Now, The Big Winners in Today's Lawsuits,&quot; submitted for publication by defendant insurance company to defendant newsmagazines. The court held that plaintiffs stated a cause of action against defendant insurance company, because commercial speech was protected only so long as it was truthful, as reflected in N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 350-a, and could be regulated in ways that noncommercial speech could not. Further, because the advertising was clearly geared toward influencing jurors and potential jurors, it also violated state public policy against jury tampering, and distorted the trial process by providing otherwise inadmissible evidence. However, the court did not grant plaintiffs a preliminary injunction because they failed to sustain their burden of demonstrating a clear right to it. Because a different standard, that of actual malice, was applied to news media than to an advertiser, the court dismissed the action against defendant publishers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Prior Restraint on Press</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. While there is a &quot;heavy presumption&quot; against the constitutional validity of prior restraints which impose a limitation on what the press may publish, injunctive relief may be permissible to regulate the content of speech in certain areas such as cases involving obscenity or advocating the overthrow of the government.  Similarly, statutes which reasonably regulate the time, manner and place of speech have been upheld.  Legitimate attempts to protect the public from present excesses of direct, active conduct, are not presumptively bad because they interfere with and, in some of its manifestations, restrain the exercise of First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Prior Restraint of Commercial Speech</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While commercial speech is constitutionally protected&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from prior restraint under the First Amendment since the free flow of commercial information is indispensable to an informed public (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Virginia Pharmacy Bd. v Virginia Consumer Council</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 425 U.S. 748), the protection afforded is less than that provided for noncommercial speech, so that when commercial expression is false or misleading it is afforded no protection whatsoever and may be regulated by the State.  (See General Business Law, &sect; 350-a.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Restraint of Misleading Advertising</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The continued publication of misleading advertisements paid for by defendant insurance company which imply that personal injury awards are often excessive and unwarranted, without mentioning that such allegedly excessive awards may be reduced or set aside if, in fact, excessive or unwarranted, may be constitutionally restrained since said advertisements, formulated to convince prospective jurors to arbitrarily reduce personal injury awards, directly contravene the rights of plaintiffs in pending personal injury actions to an impartial jury and directly contravene the State public policy against the publication of misleading advertising. (General Business Law, &sect;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  350-a.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Restraint of Misleading Advertising</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. While false or misleading advertising is not protected under the First Amendment and can constitutionally be restrained, the right of the news media to publish the commercial speech is constitutionally protected from prior restraint since the news media, which is subject to a different standard than the advertiser, is merely the conduit for the speech of the advertiser and therefore will not be held liable for the publication of advertising which is false or misleading unless actual malice is shown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Prior Restraints on Reporting of Judicial Proceedings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. When the right of free speech conflicts with the right to an impartial judicial proceeding, a &quot;balancing&quot; approach must be employed to assure that neither of these fundamental rights encroaches too far upon the other.  The reporting of, or commenting on, judicial proceedings must pose a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; constituting an &quot;imminent, not merely a likely, threat to the administration of justice&quot; before interference with First Amendment rights can be permissible by the issuance of prior restraints which carry a &quot;heavy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  presumption&quot; against their constitutional validity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Restraint on Misleading Advertising</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Advertisements paid for by defendant insurance company geared toward influencing potential jurors in personal actions in their decision-making process by implying that personal injury awards are often excessive and unwarranted to the detriment of &quot;every payer of liability insurance premiums&quot; and by cautioning juries &quot;to bear in mind that money doesn't grow on trees&quot;, may be restrained as violative of the public policy against jury tampering. (Penal Law, &sect; 215.25.) While there is a balancing between free speech and fair trial, where, as here, there is a direct assault upon the jurors, the balance weighs more heavily on the side of a fair trial, thereby permitting the restraint of information which poses a threat to the impaneling of an impartial jury, not curable by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, despite the First Amendment. Moreover, since due process requires &quot;that the jury's verdict be based on evidence received in open court, not from outside sources&quot;, the advertisements may lawfully be restrained for supplying evidence which might otherwise be inadmissible at trial and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which the plaintiffs have no opportunity to refute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Restraint of Misleading Advertising</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Since advertisements paid for by defendant insurance company, which imply that personal injury awards are often excessive and unwarranted to the detriment of &quot;every payer of liability insurance premiums&quot;, violate the State public policy against jury tampering (Penal Law, &sect; 215.25), unduly burden plaintiffs' right to an impartial jury, distort the trial process by providing otherwise inadmissible insurance evidence, and do not represent the speech of the news media, an injunction restraining these advertisements may constitutionally lie as against defendant insurance company, but not against the news media which publishes the advertisements since, as to them, the more stringent &quot;clear and present danger&quot; standard necessary for a direct prior restraint of the press has not been satisfied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Injunctions -- Preliminary Injunction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Even if a preliminary injunction may constitutionally be granted, the motion must nevertheless be denied unless plaintiffs demonstrate that they are entitled to such relief by satisfactorily establishing a likelihood of success&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the merits, that irreparable injury will result absent injunctive relief, and a balancing of equities in their favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Restraint of Misleading Advertising</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Although plaintiffs, who have pending personal injury actions, have shown that advertisements paid for by defendant insurance company which imply that personal injury awards are often excessive and unwarranted, violate their right to an impartial jury, not curable by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, they are not entitled to a preliminary injunction restraining defendant from continuing the advertisements since they have not sustained their burden of showing a clear right to such preliminary relief in the first instance.  Since there is a basis for finding that the language of the advertisements is not constitutionally protected and that the language impedes plaintiffs' ability to impanel a constitutionally guaranteed impartial jury, plaintiffs have established a cause of action for a permanent injunction against defendant insurance company, but, due to the stringent conditions which must be satisfied when seeking to restrain freedom of the press, the cause of action is dismissed as to defendant publishers.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following interventions, plaintiffs, school districts, students, cities, cities' officials, boards of education and parent association (schools), alleged that defendant, state and its university, education commissioner, comptroller, and finance commissioner (state), had implemented a method of financing public education which was unconstitutional under N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1, N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Through utilization of local property taxes, the state enacted a sliding scale formula for dispersing state aid to public schools. However, the vast majority of school districts operated under a &quot;save-harmless&quot; provision that prevented reduction of the state aid, which rendered the equalization measures useless. The schools filed suit to challenge the formula. The court awarded judgment to the schools. The evidence was uncontroverted that the formula had resulted in spending variations of more than 80 percent between districts and adversely affected educational quality, which denied equal educational opportunity. The federal equal protection attack based solely on property tax use was foreclosed by precedent. But, the aid's disbursement violated both the sliding scale and the rational basis tests for state and federal equal protection, because the formula irrationally perpetuated the inequities it was enacted to avert. The education mandate was violated because some schools were unable to provide adequate education. The state could not delegate its responsibility to ensure an adequate public education. The court retained jurisdiction but awarded no relief to allow the State to act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court awarded declaratory judgment to the schools that the formula violated state and federal equal protection guarantees and the state educational mandate, but retained jurisdiction and allowed the statutes to stand in order to grant the State an opportunity to fashion a new educational aid program.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools -- State's Method of Financing Public Education</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State's method of financing public education in the more than 700 school districts, by relying primarily on local real property taxes to finance public elementary and secondary education, improperly denies to students in poor school districts with low real property wealth, which districts must exert above average tax efforts only to realize below average expenditures, those education resources available to students in other wealthier districts with high property valuations per pupil, which districts have been able to spend large sums on public education with lower than average tax efforts, resulting in high taxes and underfinanced schools for people in low-wealth districts and lower taxes and well-financed schools for the more fortunate.  Although intended to equalize the ability of school districts to finance education, the 1974 State aid to education formula (L 1974, chs 241, 718), providing 40% of the funds required to defray total&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  expenditures of all the school districts in the State by supplying a district unable to raise $ 1,200 per pupil by a levy of a 15 mill tax on its own tax base with the amount necessary to reach that level and further assuring no decreases in State aid by the application of save-harmless provisions, does not eliminate the gross disparities in per pupil expenditures among the districts resulting from the uneven distribution of real property wealth among the districts and the imposition of the same 15 mill tax rate, and instead, by linking property wealth to school spending, makes it easier for wealthier districts to achieve high levels of spending while making it difficult, if not impossible, for poorer districts to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools -- State's Method of Financing Public Education</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The inability of school districts having comparatively low real property wealth to attain the per pupil expenditure levels of school districts possessing higher property wealth in the same county or region due to the State's primary reliance on local real property taxes to finance public education, and the failure of the State aid program to eliminate the gross disparities in expenditures among the districts&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  produced by the reliance on local real property taxes (L 1974, chs 241, 718), has significant negative consequences for school districts with relatively low property wealth, in that such districts must tax property at much higher rates to reach the same or lower levels of expenditure than is the case in districts with higher property wealth, and can, therefore, not match the ability of districts with greater real property wealth to offer such educational advantages as small class size; experienced and effective teachers; low pupil-teacher ratios; curricular breadth; extensive extracurricular programs; modern equipment; and special programs for the disadvantaged or the specially gifted.</SPAN></P>

The 1974 State aid to education formula (L 1974, chs 241, 718), measured by the full value of real property value behind each resident student in average weighted daily attendance arrived at by dividing the district's total real property valuation by the number of pupils in average daily attendance, although intended to equalize the ability of school districts to finance education, is flawed in the case of large urban school districts where&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  real estate valuations per pupil are relatively high because of the presence of various types of real property with high value, since, in actual operation, the State aid formula, in undertaking to grant operating expense aid to local school districts in proportion to their lack of local taxable resources for financing public education, overstates the capacity of cities to finance their schools by disregarding the &quot;municipal oveburden' drain of noneducational services on the local tax dollar caused by the unavoidable higher costs for police and fire protection, health care and public assistance, mass transit, parks and recreational facilities and public housing.  As a result of the inadequate measurement of local incapacity, the large urban school districts rendered poorest in school finance resources because of their greater municipal services, burdens and school costs, are treated as wealthy and receive far less State aid than other school districts that have more local resources for providing education to their pupils.</SPAN></P>

By failing to take into account the reduced purchasing power of the urban education dollar, the State aid formula has exaggerated the actual capacity of the cities to finance their schools from local revenues.</SPAN></P>

The State aid formula's use of pupil attendance instead of pupil enrollment as a measure for State aid overstates the cities' actual fiscal capacity and penalizes them for their high rates of absenteeism.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Previously, an indictment charging defendant for larceny was dismissed, and allowed to be re-presented with a charge for concealment. The indictment arose out of defendant's failure to report, on semi-annual recertification forms for public assistance, a pending personal injury lawsuit.

In denying the motion in part, the court held that the charge of concealment was not time-barred, as each recertification continued the previous concealment, and the charges were not for separate crimes.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Since defendant's repeated filings of false recertification forms with the Department of Social Services from July, 1971 to March, 1976, which forms concealed the fact that defendant, while in receipt of public assistance, had a contingent asset in the form of a pending personal injury suit from which she ultimately received a sum in excess of $ 20,000, no part of which was ever paid to or recovered by the department, constitute a continuing crime of concealing a material fact for the purpose of interfering &quot;with the proper administration of public assistance and care&quot; (Social Services Law, &sect; 145) until&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  March, 1976 and not separate crimes committed on the date of each recertification, an indictment handed up in January, 1978 alleging a concealment in violation of the statute is not barred by the two-year Statute of Limitations applicable to misdemeanor prosecutions.  ( CPL 30.10, subd 2, par [c].) The very essence of concealment is continuity for the period required to accomplish the desired result.  The Grand Jury could have concluded that defendant's purpose was to protect the integrity of any recovery in the pending suit free of any claim or lien by the Department of Social Services.  The fact that there were successive acts in aid of the concealment does not interrupt the continuity of the conduct which was directed to the accomplishment of a single purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the minor's initial two week remand period expired, the mental health facility orally requested a two-week extension. Moreover, the court held that the minor would not be produced in court.

The minor urged that her individual due process rights were the supreme consideration in testing a remand pursuant to &sect; 251 of the Family Court Act. The mental health facility urged that the effect of the medical decision was the controlling factor. The court held that due process mandated termination of the minor's psychiatric hospitalization. Moreover, the court held that while due process was flexible, the procedures must still comport with the nature of the interest implicated and the magnitude of the challenge. Additionally, the court held that there was no doubt that involuntary commitment to a mental hospital, like involuntary confinement of an individual for any reason, was a deprivation of liberty, which the state could not accomplish without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insane and Other Incompetent Persons -- Involuntary Commitments -- Due Process</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insane and Other Incompetent Persons -- Involuntary Commitment -- Due Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A finding of &quot;mental illness&quot; alone cannot justify a State's locking a person up against his will and keeping him indefinitely in simple custodial confinement; there is no constitutional basis for confining such persons involuntarily if they are dangerous to no one and can live safely in freedom, as due process requires that the nature and duration of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  commitment bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is committed.  Concomitantly, when the basis for confinement no longer exists, the confinement must terminate, since substantive due process requires adherence to the principle of the least restrictive alternative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes -- Involuntary Commitment to Mental Hospital -- Narrow Construction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A statute which sanctions involuntary commitment to a mental hospital must be narrowly construed to avoid deprivations of liberty without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law -- Due Process</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law -- Due Process -- Notice and Opportunity for Hearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. At a minimum, due process requires that deprivation of life, liberty or property by adjudication be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law -- Due Process -- Elements of Hearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Decisional precedents in defining the due process elements of a hearing at which liberty is at stake, in civil as well as criminal, proceedings, have established that the right of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  confrontation, the right of cross-examination and the right to present a defense are fundamental to fair procedure and hence constitute due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insane and Other Incompetent Persons -- Involuntary Commitment -- Due Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Where immediate action is necessary to the protection of society and for the welfare of an allegedly mentally ill person, due process does not require notice or hearing as a condition precedent to valid </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">temporary</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> involuntary confinement; a mental patient so confined is not unconstitutionally deprived of his liberty so long as he is afforded an opportunity within a reasonably short period to litigate fully the question of his mental illness and the propriety of the proceedings which led to his confinement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law -- Due Process -- Right to Counsel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The right to counsel, when an individual is faced with actual deprivation of liberty, including the right to assigned counsel for the indigent, is a due process right.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9.

Following both the hospital's failure to produce the respondent in court at the end of the remand period and its request for a two-week extension to further evaluate a treatment plan for the respondent, and the court's subpoena directed to the administrator of the hospital ordering production of the respondent, or explanation for failure to do so, the Family Court, on due process grounds, released the respondent from psychiatric hospitalization since the initial purpose of the hospitalization had ended and the respondent's needs could be met by services less restrictive than psychiatric hospitalization, in view of the fact that she was diagnosed as having an &quot;inadequate personality&quot; and it was recommended that she be placed in a structured residential facility.  </SPAN></P>

The court found that the ordinance did not test competency or provide criteria for measuring one's ability to adequately perform specific work. It did not provide minimum standards of proficiency for electrical work within the city.

It is not for government to interfere with defendant's right to work where there is no logical connection between the public welfare and the means chosen to observe it.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant brought a motion to dismiss the first two counts of an indictment against him on the ground that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.25(3) was unconstitutional on due process grounds. He argued that he had been denied due process of law by the enactment of an affirmative defense by which he must, in order to avert the thrust of the felony murder statute, affirmatively demonstrate that he fit within one of the exceptions of &sect; 125.25(3)(a)-(d). The court denied the motion. The court held that the enactment did not alter the prosecution's burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The law did, however, relieve defendant of statutory culpability in spite of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to the elements of the crime, by proving that he came within one of the ameliorative exceptions. He was not required to disprove an element. The court found that none of the affirmative defense provisions of &sect; 125.25(3) involved elements of proof for felony murder. For that reason, there was no validity to the claim that the statute unconstitutionally furnished the People with a presumption which the defense must negate.</SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 103(c) because the complaint actually sought relief in the nature of mandamus and certiorari; 2) declined to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing because: a) the prior order granting the preliminary injunction specifically addressed the county's standing and thus the court was bound under the law-of-the case doctrine, and/or b) the county had standing under both the SEQR provisions and N.Y. Exec.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Environmental Conservation -- Discretionary Review of State Agency Project in Adirondack Park</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The fact that the decision of the Adirondack Park Agency to review the plan of the State Police to relocate a troop headquarters from Franklin County to a site within the Adirondack Park was purely discretionary (Executive Law, &sect; 814) does not warrant the dismissal of causes of action brought by Franklin County seeking relief in the nature of mandamus to compel the Adirondack Park Agency to reconvene the discretionary review since the Adirondack Park Agency did in fact take jurisdiction and make its determination after a public hearing, leaving the real issue of whether or not the provisions of the State Environmental Quality Review Act ( ECL 8-0101-8-0117) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the Adirondack Park Agency (Executive Law, &sect;&sect; 800-819) were complied with in such an illegal manner as to deprive Franklin County of its rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Environmental Conservation -- Review of State Agency Projects in Adirondack Park</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Although summary judgment in an article 78 proceeding is generally denied where the respondents have not yet filed an answer ( CPLR 7804, subd [f]), the proceeding brought by Franklin County to set aside and vacate a determination of the Adirondack Park Agency authorizing the relocation of a State Police troop headquarters from Franklin County to a site within the Adirondack Park can be decided on the papers already submitted since respondents have requested that their motion to dismiss be treated as one for summary judgment ( CPLR 3211, subd [c]) and there are no fact questions to be determined.  Accordingly, the Adirondack Park Agency is directed to hold a rehearing following the filing of a proper notice of intent by the Division of State Police, in which Franklin County is to be admitted as a full party as a matter of right with all the attendant rights thereof, including, but not limited to the right to cross-examine witnesses and to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  present evidence giving due consideration to the social and economic impact of the proposed relocation on Franklin County.  To the extent that the rules and regulations implementing section 814 of the Executive Law, which governs the review of State agency projects in the Adirondack Park (9 NYCRR 587.1), would deny such full party status to Franklin County, such rules and regulations are unconstitutional and illegal and beyond the legislative intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff judgment creditor was issued a judgment by the District Court of Itzehoe, Federal Republic of Germany, against a judgment debtor. After the latter's death, the foreign district court ordered that the execution on the judgment could be had against defendant, legal successor of the judgment debtor (successor). The judgment creditor filed a motion based upon the foreign judgment for summary judgment in lieu of a complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that before reaching the jurisdictional problem in the instant action, a foreign country judgment had to pass muster as to other prerequisite standards before it was recognized in New York. The judgment had to be final, conclusive, and enforceable where rendered, and then it was conclusive between the parties to the extent that it granted or denied recovery of a sum of money. The court determined that the foreign country judgment fulfilled these statutory prerequisites and thus was recognized and accepted in the state of New York. The motion and situation before the court had to fall within the carved out exceptions for allowing quasi in rem jurisdiction. The case was unique in that the court was not dealing with a foreign state, but a foreign country judgment. The court found that without permitting the attachment and levy process as a basis for quasi in rem jurisdiction, the judgment creditor, seeking to enforce a recognized foreign country judgment, would have been barred a forum unless he was able to gain a basis for in personam jurisdiction. Justice and fair play were not being served by permitting such a situation to exist.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgments -- Enforcement of Foreign Country Judgment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Unlike the case of a sister State judgment which need merely be filed to become enforceable in this State ( CPLR 5202, 5204, 5401, 5402), a plaintiff, whether a resident or nonresident, armed with a final, conclusive and enforceable foreign country judgment granting recovery for a sum of money, entitled to recognition and acceptance in New York, may only enforce the judgment after securing some jurisdictional basis over the defendant in this State.  ( CPLR 5302, 5303.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgments -- Enforcement of Foreign Country Judgment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The United States Supreme Court, in holding that a mere fortuitous presence of property within a State is a constitutionally insufficient basis for jurisdiction to sue a defendant, the standard for determining whether an exercise of jurisdiction over the interests of a defendant is consistent with due process being whether&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the defendant had certain minimum contacts with the forum State such that maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of &quot;fair play and substantial justice&quot; (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Shaffer v Heitner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 433 U.S. 186), in order to eliminate the abusive utilization of prejudgment attachment by a plaintiff as a basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a defendant in a noninterested forum State, did not eliminate the use of postforeign judgment attachment as a basis for jurisdiction to enforce the judgment where the location of the property in the forum State is the only contact.  Accordingly, since plaintiff would be barred from enforcing a recognized foreign country judgment against defendant in New York unless he secures some jurisdictional basis over defendant in this State ( CPLR 5303), &quot;substantial justice and fair play&quot; require that plaintiff be allowed to attach funds being held in escrow for defendant in New York as a basis of gaining jurisdiction over defendant thereby entitling plaintiff to summary judgment in lieu of complaint.

Penal Law &sect;&sect; 130.25(2), 130.05(3)(a) operated as a matter of law to negate &quot;true&quot; consent because the law viewed a female of less than 17 as being incapable as a matter of law of consenting to sexual intercourse.

The element which the People must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is simply the victim's age being less than 17 years at the time of the alleged rape. Once that is shown, the statutory requirement that &quot;lack of consent&quot; be established is satisfied and the People must then show the remaining elements of the crime to the same degree of proof.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that there was a rational connection between the presumed fact and the established fact, i.e., the failure to comply with the reporting requirement.

The husband appealed that decision and the wife filed this motion for counsel fees on appeal.

The court noted that it had to have been determined whether defendant was eligible for youthful offender treatment at the time of his plea. The court held that no step in the youthful offender process was taken until conviction. The court determined that defendant's counsel was in no way chargeable with neglect in failing to apply for youthful offender treatment for defendant because the crime for which his client had been indicted rendered him ineligible for such treatment. The court also held that defendant waived his right to challenge the constitutionality of his sentence by failing to raise the question of his eligibility for youthful offender treatment at the time of his plea and sentence or by appeal.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant's 1967 manslaughter conviction upon his plea of guilty in satisfaction of a murder indictment when he was 16 years old may properly serve as the basis for predicate felony sentencing and was not rendered unconstitutional because of alleged inadequate representation by his attorney who failed to apply for youthful offender treatment for him after his conviction, since, under the youthful offender statute then in effect, which granted eligibility for youthful offender treatment to a &quot;youth who had committed a crime not punishable by death or life imprisonment&quot; (Code Crim Pro, &sect; 913-e), the crime for which defendant had been indicted rendered him ineligible for such treatment even if the Grand Jury or the District Attorney recommended it at the time of indictment. In addition, defense counsel may have been deterred from applying for youthful offender treatment even after the plea to manslaughter was accepted because of an awareness on his part that there was a conflict of authority as to whether he had a right to make such an application.  Lastly, defendant failed to negate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the possibility that his defense counsel elected as a matter of plea bargaining strategy to forego such an application since it might have adversely affected his efforts to obtain a reduction of the charge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant's 1967 manslaughter conviction upon his plea of guilty in satisfaction of a murder indictment when he was 16 years old may properly serve as the basis for predicate felony sentencing and was not rendered unconstitutional by reason of the fact that the youthful offender statute which denied him eligibility for youthful offender treatment on the basis of the crime charged in the indictment (Code Crim Pro, &sect; 913-e; CPL 720.10), was subsequently declared unconstitutional as a violation of due process insofar at it conditioned eligibility for youthful offender treatment on the basis of the highest count of the indictment rather than on the crime for which a conviction is ultimately obtained (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Drummond</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 40 NY2d 990) since defendant waived his right to challenge the constitutionality of his 1967 sentence by failing to raise the question of his eligibility for youthful offender treatment at the time of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his plea and sentence or by appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Predicate Felony Sentencing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The predicate felony sentencing statute which excludes from the 10-year period within which a prior conviction can be considered a predicate felony, any period of time during which a defendant was incarcerated between the time of commission of the previous felony and that of the present felony (Penal Law, &sect; 70.06, subd 1, par [b], cl [v]) does not violate equal protection by unfairly and irrationally differentiating between those receiving suspended sentences or probation and those incarcerated since the tolling provisions constitute a rational legislative judgment that a prior felon be required to demonstrate his ability to function in society in a lawful manner for 10 years in order to avoid being sentenced as a recidivist.  Similarly, in light of the rational reasoning behind the establishment of the 10-year period, it is not unconstitutional to have the 10-year period run from the date of sentence rather than from the date of the commission of the crime.  </SPAN></P>

The court granted the motion, holding that absent any evidence that defendant could have exercised control over the weapon found in the car in which he was an occupant or that he knew or should have known about the presence of the weapon, it would be totally irrational to conclude that the presumed fact could flow from the gun's presence in the car.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with criminal possession of a weapon under N.Y Penal Law &sect; 265.02. Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment upon the ground that the statutory language prohibiting an &quot;incendiary bomb&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. The court noted that a statute duly enacted by the Legislature carried a strong presumption of constitutionality and that its invalidity must be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant argued that &quot;incendiary bomb&quot; was susceptible of application to many flammable articles whose possession it was not intended to make a criminal offense, and therefore the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the doctrine of vagueness did not mean that where a key word in a statute was not defined, it was constitutionally defective. A lack of precision in statutory language did not automatically mean that the requirements of due process had been offended. The court held that the statute conveyed sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.

All work left undone by the prior lessee had been approved by the department of buildings and was completed by defendant. Five months after moving in defendant applied for a building permit. The department served a peremptory vacate notice on defendant on the grounds that egress was inadequate. The order was challenged and set aside. An ad hoc agreement was immediately reached where the department allowed the egress to have been constructed by defendant. The department permitted the work to go forward and then brought the prosecutions against defendant for completion of the work without approval. The court held that the same instrumentality that prosecuted defendant was responsible, by its own informal agreement, for the violation of which it complained.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conviction of corporate defendant, a health club, for completing work on the egresses from its premises without the approval of the Department of Buildings of the City of New York, in violation of the zoning moratorium aimed at the proliferation of massage parlors, is vacated in the interests of justice ( CPL 170.40) since the Department of Buildings, by first serving a peremptory vacate notice on defendant on the grounds that egress was inadequate after defendant had completed previously approved work which had been left undone by the prior lessee and then closing off the means of compliance with the building regulations by withholding its approval, created an impossible burden tantamount to a confiscatory deprivation of property. The department, which brought on the prosecutions for completion of the work without approval only after permitting the work to go forward, has already granted an exception to the zoning moratorium to another health and racquet club. It would therefore be counterproductive to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  orderly administration of justice to have the stigma of an adjudication of guilt and its attendant cloud on title stand in the face of the overpowering equities in favor of defendant.  </SPAN></P>

The court denied the county's motion for summary judgment to dismiss the owners' complaint as to the county. Under N.Y. High.

Plaintiffs' failure to comply with the notice of claim requirements of section 52 of the County Law before commencing an action to permanently enjoin defendant county from discharging water onto their land from a drainage ditch running along a town highway does not warrant the dismissal of the complaint on defendant's motion for summary judgment in light of the lack of any definitive case law holding the notice of claim requirements applicable where the relief demanded is primarily equitable in nature and the monetary relief demanded is merely &quot;incidental to&quot; the equitable relief sought.  Plaintiffs are entitled to the benefit of the doubt on a motion for summary judgment since the question is still open as to whether or not compliance with section 52 of the County Law is a condition precedent in an action seeking injunctive relief. </SPAN></P>

Further, the experts were hired at a time when Model Code of Prof'l Responsibility DR 7-109, which limited the manner in which a lawyer could compensate a witness, had been held unconstitutional. Thus, to deprive shareholders of the opportunity to have the testimony considered would have punished them for what hindsight showed to have been a mistake of judgment in relying on a lower court holding. The court found that corporation's right to seek a stay of the action was waived by its failure to do so previously. It had, in fact, previously opposed an application for a stay brought by shareholders. Respondent attempted to explain its inconsistent positions by asserting a change in the law on collateral estoppel. However, the court found that that decision should have come as no surprise based upon its recent decisions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Three accountants who are being paid a contingent fee by petitioners to testify as expert witnesses in a consolidated appraisal proceeding (Business Corporation Law, &sect; 623) brought by two groups of dissenting shareholders, are not incompetent to testify in the appraisal proceeding by reason of the contingent fee since the nature of an expert's fee arrangement is relevant only to his credibility not his competency to testify.  DR 7-109 (C) of the Code of Professional Responsibility which prohibits a lawyer from offering to pay or acquiescing in the &quot;payment of compensation to a witness contingent upon the content of his testimony or the outcome of the case&quot; only represents an indirect &quot;legislative judgment&quot; with respect to contingent fees and in no way limits the applicability of CPLR 4512 which does not preclude a witness from testifying &quot;by reason of his interest in the event&quot;.  The disciplinary rule only gives the Appellate Division, through its disciplinary powers over attorneys, the power to indirectly limit the provisions of CPLR 4512 and does not provide an exception thereto.</SPAN></P>

Respondent should have been aware at the time of petitioner's application for a stay that its right to a jury trial on the issue of damages in the Federal action could be lost by the application of collateral estoppel based on a finding of fair market value in the appraisal proceeding. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers filed an action under N.Y. Real Prop.

C.P.L.R. 3216(e) after more than a year passed following joinder of issue and the taxpayers did not respond within 45 days to a written demand filed by respondents for resumption of the prosecution of the proceeding and a note of issue. The court denied the motion, holding that, although N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3216 was applicable to tax certiorari proceedings, and N.Y. Real Prop.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Failure to Prosecute Tax Assessment Review Proceeding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Since there is no specific statute regulating tax certiorari procedure, CPLR 3216, which authorizes the dismissal of an action or proceeding for want of prosecution if the party upon whom is served a demand to resume prosecution of the action more than one year after joinder of issue, fails to serve and file a note of issue within 45 days &quot;unless the said&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  party shows justifiable excuse for the delay and a good and meritorious cause of action&quot;, is applicable to tax certiorari proceedings (Real Property Tax Law, art 7) in which the customary and long-standing practice is to accumulate several years of tax assessment review proceedings for ultimate consolidation in one trial prior to filing notes of issues because of the prohibitive costs involved in challenging tax assessments.  If certain of the rules or statutes which comprise the tax assessment review procedure are unduly costly and burdensome to small taxpayers the remedy lies in challenging those specific rules and procedures or in seeking legislative relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Failure to Prosecute Tax Assessment Review Proceeding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 718 of the Real Property Tax Law, which mandates the automatic dismissal of a tax assessment review proceeding in which a note of issue is not filed within four years after service of the petition and notice, does not evince a legislative determination that four years is a reasonable time within which to file a note of issue in a tax review proceeding and therefore does not conflict with CPLR 3216 which involves possible dismissal of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  proceeding for want of prosecution where there has been a delay in prosecution of one year and a subsequent demand made to resume prosecution.  Under section 718 a four-year delay is not per se unreasonable, but a delay of one year followed by a demand to resume prosecution under CPLR 3216, which is not complied with, may be grounds for a dismissal for want of prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Failure to Prosecute Tax Assessment Review Proceeding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Notwithstanding the applicability of CPLR 3216, which authorizes the dismissal of an action or proceeding for want of prosecution where there has been a delay of one year followed by an uncomplied with demand to resume prosecution, to tax certiorari proceedings (Real Property Tax Law, art 7) petitioners' delay in filing notes of issue does not warrant dismissal of the tax review proceedings since petitioners have shown some merit to the proceedings and justification for the delay which resulted from the customary practice of accumulating several years of tax review proceedings for ultimate consolidation in one trial prior to filing notes of issue.  In addition, since the 30-day Statute of Limitations has long since run, petitioners would&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be grievously injured if the proceedings were dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bank challenged the decision of the Supreme Court in Rockland County (New York), which found in favor of defendant condominium association and ruled that even though the association's lien against foreclosed property was filed subsequent to the bank's second mortgage, the association's lien had priority under N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 339-z.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The condominium owners (owners) gave a second mortgage affecting their home to the bank, which recorded the mortgage. The condominium association (association) subsequently filed a lien against the property for principal and interest then due for the condominium's common charges. The premises were eventually sold in foreclosure. However, there was not enough money to pay off both liens. The referee found that the association's lien had priority under N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 339-z. On review, the court found that under &sect; 339-z, once notice of the lien was filed, by such act the lien for common charges obtained a priority over previously filed liens and mortgages, even that of the bank. The only exceptions were liens for taxes or first mortgages. Therefore, the referee's report that found in favor of the association was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Condominiums -- Statutory Lien for Unpaid Common Charges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Pursuant to section 339-z of the Real Property Law, which provides that a lien for condominium common charges in favor of the condominium's board of managers is &quot;prior to all of other liens&quot; other than that of a first mortgagee of record or a municipality for realty taxes, and the ensuing section 339-aa, which provides that such a lien for common charges is not effective until filed &quot;in the office&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the recording officer&quot;, a properly filed statutory lien for condominium common charges is entitled to priority over a previously recorded second mortgage since, although the lien for common charges is without force and effect until filed, once the notice of lien is so filed, however, such lien obtains a priority over previously filed liens and mortgages except for the two statutory exceptions.  Any contrary interpretation of the statutory scheme, granting priority to a lien for condominium common charges over a second mortgage only where such lien was filed prior in time to said second mortgage, would be a perversion of the apparent legislative intention to afford priority to a lien for common charges over a second mortgage even where such lien was filed after the second mortgage and would render section 339-z largely meaningless since the concept of prior in time, prior in right, is already well established by the &quot;recording acts&quot;.  (Real Property Law, art 9.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Condominiums -- Statutory Lien for Unpaid Common Charges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

A requirement that the board of managers update its liens monthly in order to protect additional amounts accruing each month would be costly, burdensome and contrary to the legislative objective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Condominiums -- Statutory Lien for Unpaid Common Charges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Sections 339-z and 339-aa of the Real Property Law, which grant a properly filed lien for unpaid condominium common charges priority over a previously&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  recorded second mortgage, are constitutional, being reasonable and necessary to protect a legitimate interest of the Legislature, which has the power to make reasonable exceptions to New York's recording acts.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A municipality's penal statute is unconstitutional under the &quot;home rule&quot; provision of the State Constitution (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2) if the field has been pre-empted; where the State has acted upon a subject and, in so acting, has evidenced a desire that its general laws should pre-empt the possibility of varying local laws, a local enactment may be said to be inconsistent with State law if it prohibits that which has been found acceptable under State law.  Accordingly, a local disorderly conduct ordinance that is more restrictive than the State statute, in that the local ordinance prohibits the creation of unlawful disturbances not merely in public places but also in private premises, is unconstitutional as it prohibits that which is not proscribed by State law in an area that has been pre-empted. </SPAN></P>

The CSS, the hospital, and the prospective adoptive parents relied upon the surrender itself and the mother's constitutional right to surrender her child for adoption. The court found that the surrender was not voluntary, informed, and knowing and set it aside as violative of due process because the mother's constitutional right to surrender her baby did not relieve the state of its parens patriae responsibilities to minors. The court held that the parens patriae obligation imposed a moral duty on the state in its dealings with minors; that vindication of its interest in the baby did not relieve the state of its obligations to the minor mother; and that the state had to provide safeguards to ensure that a minor's surrender was voluntary, knowing, and informed.</SPAN></P>

The fact that a minor has the same constitutional right to surrender parental rights as does an adult (Social Services Law, &sect; 384) and the State's primary and legitimate interest in protecting the interests of the baby who is the subject of a surrender agreement, does not relieve the State of all responsibility as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">parens patriae</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in dealing with minors who are parents or allow the State, in the name of the individual's constitutional rights, to treat minors as the contractual equals of the State and to deal with them according to the &quot;morals of the market place.&quot; Accordingly, a complex, printed form surrender agreement executed by a 17-year-old mother who received no counseling services from the foundling hospital acting as agent for the Commissioner of Social Services regarding adoption or alternatives thereto; was not made aware of the technical provisions of the instrument; was not advised that she did not then have to make a decision regarding her child&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or to sign the papers presented to her; was not permitted to have a sister or friend present as she had requested; was not afforded an opportunity to reflect on the terms of the instrument or to discuss the instrument with her father or mother; and was not afforded an opportunity to seek legal advice, is set aside as violative of due process and null and void.</SPAN></P>

Since legal advice is a basic component of an informed surrender agreement (Social Services Law, &sect; 384) between the State and a parent who is a minor, the Legislature should create an Office of Ombudsman for Minors in order to fulfill the State's affirmative moral obligation to the minor in its role as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">parens patriae</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to safeguard a voluntary, informed and knowing surrender decision by the minor.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New York, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 436-7.0 provided for two types of tow car licenses, an unrestricted license, for towers who operate facilities for repair of vehicles requiring body or collision work and who could solicit at the scene of accidents, and a restricted license, for owners of tow trucks for public hire. Petitioners filed an action to enjoin respondents from enforcing &sect; 436-7.0 and to challenge the licensing and the regulatory scheme of the tow car industry.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Tow Car Industry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The licensing and regulatory scheme of the tow car industry in New York City established by section 436-7.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York and implemented by police department regulations which provides for an &quot;unrestricted license&quot; for towers who are authorized to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  solicit at the scene of accidents and must maintain 24-hour a day two service, a police radio, facilities for body and collision work and be open for reclamation of cars at specific hours, and a &quot;restricted license&quot; for owners of other tow trucks for public hire, while exempting from the licensing requirements those tow cars which are not available for public hire, is valid, constituting a reasonable mechanism for supervising and administering the complex and important tow car industry and being reasonably related to the objective of protecting the public in their business dealings with the tow car industry.  The rate structure for both types of licensees established under the licensing scheme is integral and necessary to the protection of the public and the mandated color scheme, which requires unrestricted licensees to paint their tow vehicles chrome yellow with medium blue trim, is reasonably related to assisting the public as well as the police force in identifying which tow cars are authorized to solicit at the scene of an accident.  The fact that some unlicensed tow cars operate illegally within the city cannot be used to invalidate the entire licensing scheme.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since tow vehicles which are not available for public hire are exempted from the licensing requirements applicable to tow vehicles for public hire operating within the City of New York (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 436-7.0), the award of a contract by the city for the towing of illegally parked cars from the midtown area to a company with unlicensed tow cars with a per tow charge in excess of the fees licensed towers are permitted to charge, does not warrant the invalidation of the entire licensing and regulatory scheme of the tow car industry.  Towers acting as agents on behalf of the police department may lawfully charge a different fee than commercial licensed towers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Tow Car Industry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The licensing and regulatory scheme for the tow car industry in New York City (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 436-7.0) does not unduly burden licensed towers by subjecting them to police department regulations and administrative hearings for violations thereof in addition to being subject to Criminal Court appearances for violations relating to the operations of their&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tow cars since each forum serves a different function and they cannot be mutually exclusive.  The police commissioner had authority to order a moratorium on the issuance of new unrestricted towing car licenses, which allow the holders to solicit at the scene of accidents, pending new legislation to alleviate industry abuses under the current licensing system.  The authority to issue a license does not confer a vested or absolute right thereto, but only permits a personal privilege to be exercised under restrictions existing at the time of the issuance of the license and such as may thereafter be reasonably imposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Tow Car Industry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Transportation Department of the City of New York acted within its legal discretion in granting exclusive franchises for towing on 50 enumerated roadways, parkways, expressways and bridges to only holders of unrestricted towing car licenses (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 436-7.0) in order to provide adequate road service as quickly as possible so as to reduce delay and congestion on the heavily traveled arteries of the city.  Permitees must meet certain requirements as to 24-hour a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  day operation, specific hours of patrol, and offer efficient service and are subject to periodic review by the department, after which their permits may be rescinded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Tow Car Industry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Although the over-all regulatory scheme of the tow car industry in New York City is valid (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 436-7.0), the restriction upon the transfer of existing tow car licenses held by individuals or partnerships is invalid since there is no basis for a restriction upon the transfer of existing tow car licenses, assuming the party to whom the license is to be transferred meets the existing criteria for such license. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended that language contained in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 190.40, which stated &quot;not being authorized or permitted by law,&quot; invalidated &sect; 190.40 for failure to specify which other laws it referred to, which the court determined was a reference to N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 16. The court held that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 190.40 had not violated N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 16 because it was within the purview of the presumptive validity of N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 21. The language of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 190.40 was clearly stated, and there was a reasonable connection between &sect; 190.40 and the promotion of the welfare of society. Section 190.40 specifically proscribed and fixed the standard as to what was prohibited to give a reasonable man notice of what constituted unlawful conduct. Defendant's due process rights under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, the Fifth Amendment, and the Fourteenth Amendment were not violated by their prosecution. The court found that the language of the indictment was insufficient, because it was a mere restatement of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 190.40 and failed to allege the specific facts of the alleged loansharking activities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the constitutionality of the loansharking statute, but dismissed the indictments against defendants for lack of specificity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Criminal Usury</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The &quot;loansharking&quot; statute (Penal Law, &sect; 190.40) which provides that a &quot;person is guilty of criminal usury when, not being authorized or permitted by law to do so, he knowingly charges, takes or receives any money or other property as interest on the loan&quot; at a rate exceeding 25% per annum, does not unlawfully incorporate other laws by reference in defining the crime in violation of section 16 of article III of the State Constitution.  Defendants have failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality that attaches to an act which might otherwise be void under section 16 of article III of the State Constitution when such act, as the &quot;loansharking&quot; statute, has been recommended to the Legislature by commissioners appointed pursuant to law to revise statutes (NY Const, art III, &sect; 21).  The &quot;loansharking&quot; statute does not violate due process since there is a fair, just and reasonable connection between the statute and its proscription and the promotion of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  health, comfort, safety and welfare of society.  The statute is sufficiently definite so as to give a reasonable man of ordinary intelligence fair, unequivocal warning of what conduct is prohibited and what is required of him.  Persons such as defendants engaged in the business of making loans have sufficient intelligence in mathematics to know when the &quot;rates&quot; exceed the statutory limit and to therefore seek legal advice.  No fundamental &quot;sense of justice&quot; will be denied defendants by subjecting them to prosecution under the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An indictment charging defendants with committing criminal usury (Penal Law, &sect; 190.40) by merely setting forth the concise verbiage of the statute without asserting &quot;facts supporting every element of the offense charged * * * with sufficient precision to clearly apprise the defendant * * * of the conduct which is the subject of the accusation&quot; ( CPL 200.50, subd 7) is legally insufficient and must be dismissed.  A criminal indictment for usury should set forth the amount of the claimed usurious loans, the time the loans were made, the manner in which the loans were usurious and the amount of principal and interest&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  paid on the loans.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree for growing marijuana on their private property. Defendants moved to suppress the marihuana, which was seized without a warrant by a deputy sheriff, and oral admissions made by one defendant. The court denied their motion. U.S. Const. amend. IV did not protect defendants in this case. Growing a prohibited product in an open field constituted a waiver of any expected privacy guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. IV and invited confiscation without a warrant. In addition to the presumption of the constitutionality of a statute of the New York State Legislature, there was an adequate foundation to hold that the Marihuana Reform Act of 1977 was constitutional. Further, defendant's oral admissions concerning the marihuana were admissible because they were spontaneously made while not in police custody.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' motion to suppress marihuana and oral admissions was denied because defendants waived any expectations of privacy by growing marihuana in an open field, the Marihuana Reform Act of 1977 was constitutional, and the oral admissions were spontaneously made while not in police custody.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The protection of the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures does not extend to the growing of marihuana on one's private property in an open field. Growing such a prohibited product in an &quot;open field&quot; constitutes a waiver of any privacy which anyone might expect to be constitutionally protected by the Fourth Amendment, inviting confiscation without a warrant.  Accordingly, since a police officer who received information that defendant was growing marihuana on his property and who observed and identified cannabis plants growing in a garden on defendant's property, had probable cause to enter defendant's property, the marihuana seized by him will not be suppressed.</SPAN></P>

The Marihuana Reform Act of 1977 (L 1977, ch 360), which prohibits the growing, possession and use of marihuana, decriminalizing only the possession of small amounts of marihuana, is constitutional since the manufacture, use and possession of any controlled substance which affects the behavior, mood and judgment of persons is a legitimate area of concern over which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Legislature has the power to regulate. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the parties' collective bargaining agreement, accumulated vacation time and converted sick leave were to be paid to any county employee upon his termination from service unless he was discharged for cause. When the county employees became state employees under N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 220(6)(d), they applied for payment of their accumulated leave. The county rejected the claims. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the county employees. The language of the agreement was clear and unambiguous and precluded any conclusion that the county employees' service was not terminated by operation of the statute. The county employees' right to an immediate cash payment vested at the time their service was terminated. The provision in &sect; 220 allowing a transfer of a limited number of days of accumulated vacation was unconstitutional and invalid to the extent that it retroactively modified the existing obligation in the collective bargaining agreement.</SPAN></P>

The complaint alleged upon direct knowledge of a police officer that defendants solicited money by giving out lollipops in a shopping center.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The activities of defendants in soliciting money for the Unification Church by giving out lollipops in a shopping center without a license falls within the ambit of the peddling and soliciting law of the Town of Greenburgh which, with the exception of bona fide charitable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  religious or political organizations, prohibits the selling or bartering of goods, wares or merchandise by going from place to place on foot without first obtaining a license. In contrast to the sale of religious publications in return for contributions, the sale of lollipops imports no religious activity and has no reverential connotation.  The peddling may have been an ancillary endeavor by the Unification Church to obtain funds subject to taxation under the Internal Revenue Code.</SPAN></P>

The peddling and soliciting law of the Town of Greenburgh, which, with the exception of bona fide charitable, religious or political organizations, prohibits the selling or bartering of goods, wares or merchandise by going from place to place on foot without first obtaining a license and is designed to protect the community from the cheats, frauds and thefts which are likely to attend the itinerent and irresponsible peddling from place to place and from door to door, is an unambiguous, valid exercise of police power. Defendants may therefore be tried for exchanging lollipops for funds for the benefit of the Unification&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Church without a license in violation of the ordinance.  There is no requirement that the town code define a bona fide religious organization since a court can determine whether a proposed association is in essence a truly religious corporation under the Religious Corporations Law without having to pass judgment on the religious quality or spiritual probity of the faith sought to be established.  While the First Amendment proscribes any governmental regulation of religious belief, the free exercise clause does not proscribe governmental regulation of overt criminal acts prompted by religious beliefs or principles.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner individual brought a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding seeking judgment annulling the order of respondent, the state commissioner of health. The operating certificate of the individual as an operator of a nursing home had been revoked and annulled by order of the commissioner of health.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual held an interest in a partnership, which owned and operated a nursing home. He had been convicted on three felony counts of an indictment related to his employment in an administrative capacity at another nursing home. The individual argued, among other things, that N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2806(5), adopted after the individual's conviction, was an &quot;ex post facto&quot; law and therefore unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 2806(5)(d) required that a copy of the notice and charges be served in person or mailed before the hearing. The record was silent, however, as to the service of notice of the hearing. Although the title page identifying the proceeding before the hearing referee listed an appearance for the partnership's nursing home by the same attorney who represented the individual at the hearing, the transcript of the minutes of the hearing reflected an appearance on behalf of the individual only. No appearance was made by the partnership or the nursing home.

Penal Law &sect; 165.15, preempted the field with respect to meter tampering and that such tampering involved a theft of services and nothing more. The court first found that metered electricity was a commodity which could be the subject of larceny. The court then held that there was no conflict in &sect; 165.15 and the larceny statutes embodied in N.Y. Penal Law art. 155. Following the rule of construction that statutes should be read together wherever possible, the court held that a person who has stolen electricity has committed two separate crimes, theft of services and larceny. The validity of the indictments was not affected by the duplicative counts. Therefore, defendants were properly charged with the felony of grand larceny.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Larceny of Metered Electricity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Metered electricity, natural gas, water in pipes, heat, power, and similar forms of &quot;intangible&quot; energy are commodities which may be the subjects of larceny (Penal Law, art 155).  The meter tamperer who, by such tampering, receives electric current without payment, takes or obtains an &quot;article of value&quot; under circumstances amounting to a &quot;deprivation&quot; in that the &quot;major portion&quot; of the &quot;economic value&quot; of this &quot;property&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is lost to the supplier. Accordingly, the meter tamperer commits a larcency when he receives for himself the diverted electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Larceny of Metered Electricity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Prosecution of a theft of metered electricity as a larceny is permissible notwithstanding the existence of a special detailed misdemeanor theft of services statute, which, in addition to covering the supply of electricity, also covers such items as restaurant, hotel, railroad, subway and bus services (Penal Law, &sect; 165.15), since both the larceny and theft of services statutes are applicable where there is both a service and an actual commodity. The misdemeanor theft of services will constitute a lesser included offense as to larceny in most meter-tampering situations.  In such cases of statutory duplication, the Trial Judge protects the defendant from duplicate punishments for the same act by eliminating duplicative counts in an indictment from a jury's consideration ( CPL art 300).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Meter-Tampering Presumption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The statutory meter-tampering presumption which makes proof of meter tampering &quot;presumptive evidence&quot; that the recipient of the service created that condition (Penal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Law, &sect; 165.15) is constitutional since the meter-tampering presumption is an inevitable inference resulting from the fact that the subscriber is the only party who could possibly benefit from tampering with the meter. The statutory terminology of &quot;presumptive evidence&quot; merely has the effect of permitting an inference to be drawn from the established facts that another fact exists without the necessity of proof of the inferred fact and it does not mandate guilt nor obviate the fundamental burden of the prosecution to prove the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes - Larceny of Metered Electricity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After trial, a jury found defendant individual guilty of the felony of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. In its charge to the jury, the trial court instructed the jury concerning the presumption of possession by all persons in an automobile of a weapon found in that automobile, under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.15 subdiv. 3. Approximately three weeks after the verdict, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit declared &sect; 265.15 subdiv. 3&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied and on its face. Based on that opinion, defendant moved to set aside the jury verdict of guilty. The court found that it was not bound by the federal court of appeals' interpretation of state law, unless and until the Supreme Court validated that interpretation. Therefore, the court denied defendant's motion, as the court and other state courts had found the presumption to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

VI, by the use in a preliminary hearing of a sworn written statement of a witness in lieu of the personal appearance of such witness pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 180.60(8).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with grand larceny, criminal possession of stolen property, and unauthorized use of a vehicle. At the preliminary hearing, the prosecution sought to introduce into evidence, pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 180.60(8), an affidavit, signed by the owner of the vehicle in question, which stated that defendant had no right to take, operate, use, damage, tamper, or exercise dominion or control of the vehicle and had no right to possession. Defendant contended that the introduction of the affidavit was unconstitutional in that it deprived him of the right to confront witnesses against him. The court denied his motion to dismiss all the charges against him, holding that the U.S. Const. amend. VI guaranteed confrontation at some point in the over-all prosecution, and not at each and every stage of the prosecution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion was denied because there was no requirement under the Sixth Amendment that defendant be allowed to confront a witness at a preliminary hearing prior to trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Preliminary Hearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A preliminary hearing, in the absence of a statute providing otherwise, is not a prerequisite or an indispensable step in the prosecution of a person accused of a crime.  At the preliminary hearing, the People need only present a broad outline of the facts and the court may narrowly limit cross-examination. A preliminary hearing, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  when it does, in fact, take place, is a &quot;critical stage&quot; of a State's criminal process at which the accused has a constitutional right to the assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Right of Accused to Confront Witnesses Against Him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. If an accused is to be deprived of his constitutional right under the Sixth Amendment to confront witnesses against him, there must be salient and cogent reasons for the deprivation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Use of Affidavit in Lieu of Personal Appearance of Witness at Preliminary Hearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The use in a preliminary hearing of an affidavit signed by the owner of a vehicle stating &quot;the absence of his consent to the defendant's taking, operating, exercising control over or using&quot; said vehicle, in lieu of a personal appearance as authorized by CPL 180.60 (subd 8) and CPL 190.30 (subd 3, par [d]), does not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him since the right to confrontation is basically a trial right and there is no Sixth Amendment requirement that a defendant be allowed to confront a witness at a preliminary hearing prior to trial. The Sixth Amendment guarantees confrontation with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  witnesses at some point in the over-all prosecution but not at each and every stage of the prosecution.  Confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses is not essential, as a matter of constitutional principle, for judicial determination of probable cause for detention.  The use of an affidavit of permission and authority at a preliminary hearing promotes justice in that the witness is not inconvenienced by having to wait many hours or suffering adjournments without even testifying.  The witness' testimony would take place at the trial.  The defense attorney can avail himself of the affidavit which he may then utilize in his strategy for trial and to cross-examine the witness at trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Presumption of Constitutionality of Legislative Enactment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendant, in attacking the constitutionality of the statute permitting the use of sworn statements in lieu of personal appearances of certain witnesses in a preliminary hearing ( CPL 180.60, subd 8) as being violative of his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him, failed to overcome the burden of the strong presumption of constitutionality of a legislative enactment. A statute should&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not ordinarily be set aside as unconstitutional by a court of original jurisdiction unless such conclusion is inescapable. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, an off-track betting corporation, brought a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding, seeking a declaration that a certain rule and regulation was null and void, authorizing it to operate a premises as an off-track betting parlor and enjoining respondent, State racing and wagering board, from interfering with such operation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state racing and wagering board brought a motion to dismiss the petition on the ground that it failed to state a cause of action. The issue related solely to an off-track betting office which the corporation sought to establish within one mile of a racetrack. In its motion to dismiss the petition, the State board relied solely upon its contention that the proceeding was premature in that the corporation failed to formally apply for the approval since the adoption of the rule, and had not yet exhausted its administrative remedies. The court held that it was clear, according to the petition, which for the purposes of the motion had to be deemed to be true, that the corporation would be embarking on a futile, wasteful and counter-productive procedure to seek to have the State board overturn its own rule. The relevant rule would have effectively excluded the corporation from opening the office in question since it precluded the opening of an office within one mile of a racetrack. The court held that the law did not require such a useless act. The court further held that the rule was void and unconstitutional and beyond the authority of the State board.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner is not first required to pursue further administrative remedies since it would be a waste of time and a charade for petitioner to apply to respondent for permission to open a betting parlor within one mile of Belmont Race Track or for a hearing before respondent as to the validity of its rule where said rule was adopted over the objections of petitioner and was prompted to thwart petitioner's application to open the office.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the law secretary was not entitled to a &quot;grandfather&quot; exemption from the application of &sect; 25.44. The law secretary appealed and the court dismissed his petition. The court held that &sect; 25.44 did not assume to regulate law practice. It required that law secretaries to justices were to be lawyers not engaged in private practice.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Administrative Board of the Judicial Conference, under its broad statutory authority to regulate employment within the judicial system by the establishment of &quot;standards and policies&quot; relating to &quot;personnel practices&quot; concerning nonjudicial employees (Judiciary Law, &sect; 212), had the power and authority&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to promulgate a rule closely restricting the right of lawyers &quot;employed full time in any court or agency of the unified court system&quot; to engage in the private practice of law (22 NYCRR 25.44) in order to prevent the appearance of impropriety arising from the inevitable and inherent conflict between public employment and the private practice of law. The rule adopted by the board does not assume to regulate private law practice. It only requires that employees such as law secretaries to Supreme Court Justices not be engaged in private practice.  The cardinal rule interdicting the appearance, no less than the reality, of judicial impropriety (Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2, subd B) applies with equal force to the conduct and activities of those individuals, such as law secretaries, who have a close and confidential relation with Supreme Court Justices.</SPAN></P>

The rule adopted by the board does not regulate the private practice of law but instead only regulates employment within the judicial system. While petitioner, a law secretary for a Supreme Court Justice, may have a constitutional right to conduct a private law practice, he does not have a constitutional right to be or continue to be a law secretary under any and all circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Restricting Right of Employees in Judicial System to Engage in Private Practice of Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, in an omnibus motion seeking divers relief, alleged that the indictment, which charged him with grand larceny and theft of services, was defective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the grand larceny charge, defendant was accused of stealing property, gas, from a gas company. Defendant claimed that gas was not property, but was a service, and that the presumptions contained in &sect; 165.15, that a person who tampered with a meter without the consent of the supplier was presumed to do so with the intent to avoid payment, and proof that service had been diverted was presumptive evidence that the person who accepted the use of the service had done so with knowledge of the diversion, were unconstitutional on their face because they did not logically flow from the state of facts that had to be proved. The court denied the motion to dismiss. The indictment, which charged the crime of larceny within the language of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 155.05(1), was sufficient. &quot;Gas&quot; was not a service and could be the subject of a larceny. The crime of larceny was a separate and distinct offense from that created by making it unlawful to tamper with a gas meter. The issue of the constitutionality of the presumptions was premature because there was nothing in the record to indicate the proof the State would introduce and the extent the State would rely on the presumptions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Supreme Court of New York, Bronx County, of the class A-III felony sale of $ 20 of cocaine and received a mandatory life sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant withdrew a plea of guilty to a lesser offense, defendant went to trial on an indictment for the class A-III felony sale of $ 20 of cocaine, which carried with it a mandatory life sentence. Defendant was convicted by a jury. On the date of sentencing defendant's counsel moved to have the sentencing provisions of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.00 declared unconstitutional as applied to defendant, who had never been in any conflict with the law prior to his drug conviction. The trial court denied the motion and defendant received the mandatory life sentence. On review, the court vacated the life sentence and imposed a definite sentence of one year. The court found that the punishment as to defendant was cruel and unusual because its severity served no valid penological purpose. The court held that there was no valid penological purpose to be served in inflicting on defendant the second most severe punishment in the jurisdiction for the same offense that the legislature decreed a sentence of one year or less would adequately protect society had defendant pled rather than chosen a trial alternative.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Constitutionality of Drug Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Empirical data collated subsequent to the enactment of the new drug laws in 1973 indicating that the severe penalties imposed by the drug laws including a mandatory life sentence for those convicted of class A-III drug felonies, have not had a deterrent effect on drug abuse and drug trafficking in the State, together with the 1976 amendments to subdivision 4 of section 70.00 of the Penal Law and CPL 220.20, which permit small scale sellers of narcotics charged with class A-III drug felonies to plead down to class C felonies and thus be eligible to receive a sentence of probation or a definite sentence of imprisonment of one year or less, have, on the facts of this case, rebutted the legislative presumptions in 1973 that the new drug laws would serve the valid penological ends of deterrence and the isolation of narcotics sellers from society for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a long duration (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Broadie</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 37 NY2d 100). Accordingly, since the mandatory imposition of a life sentence upon defendant following his conviction, after trial, of the class A-III sale of $ 20 worth of cocaine is grossly disproportionate to the sentence he would have received had he pleaded guilty to the class C felony, serving no valid penological purpose thereby amounting to cruel and inhuman punishment, he is sentenced to one-year imprisonment based upon his prior good record, the small amount of cocaine involved and the letters of commendation received on his behalf.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a motion seeking attorney's fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1988 in an action brought to compel respondents, the Acting Commissioner of the New York State Department of Social Services and others, to issue a decision in a fair hearing proceeding held to review a determination regarding petitioner's eligibility to receive funds for housekeeping services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A decision was not issued within 90 days of petitioner's fair hearing request as required by N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 358.18(a). Rather, the decision was issued one week after petitioner commenced the N.Y.C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding to compel the decision and it was in her favor. Thus, petitioner argued that the delay in rendering the decision constituted a deprivation of her rights in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and that the issuance of a decision in her favor entitled her to an award of fees and costs under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. After review, the court disagreed. First, there was no merit to petitioner's claim that a fee award under &sect; 1988 was mandatory because petitioner's issue involved the performance of an act required by a state official rather than a civil rights violation which the statutes were intended to remedy. Second, there was no basis for finding that the interests of justice warranted a discretionary fee award in petitioner's case. 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 had not been extended to permit the recovery of monetary damages in suits against state officials and to allow petitioner to recover fees would have impermissibly permitted such recovery.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An award of attorney's fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Act of 1976 (US Code, tit 42, &sect; 1988), which authorizes the court, in its discretion, to award the prevailing party &quot;a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs&quot; of maintaining a Federal civil rights action (US Code, tit 42, &sect; 1983), is not justified where petitioner had to bring an article 78 proceeding in order to compel the State Department of Social Services to issue a decision in a fair hearing proceeding as required by department regulations (18 NYCRR 358.18 [a]).  Allowing an award of attorney's fees where only the performance of a required act by a State official is at issue would contravene the national policy of denying awards of attorney's fees except in restricted areas of litigation involving important areas of civil rights such as illegal bias or discrimination.  In addition, an award of attorney's fees where the respondent is a State official responsible for the operation of a department which discharges quasi-judicial functions is not permissible in a Federal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  civil rights action, which is limited to suits against &quot;persons&quot; and not states.  </SPAN></P>

The court determined that &sect; 340.40(7) was unconstitutional, because it did not provide mandatory youthful offenders with the full protections. The court determined that &sect; 340.40(7) violated the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection of the law; its differentiation between mandatory and discretionary youthful offenders had no rational basis but, rather, discriminated against the group that had the strongest claim to statutory protection.

The special benefits conferred by the rehabilitative orientation of the juvenile process do not outweigh the disadvantages occasioned by the loss of the right to a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jury trial. In addition, the statute denies mandatory youthful offenders equal protection of the laws since the differentiation between such offenders and discretionary youthful offenders, who, by contrast, are entitled to a jury trial by reason of their exposure to a sentence in excess of six months, has no rational basis and instead discriminates against the group that has the strongest claim to statutory protection.  Denial of a jury trial to mandatory youthful offenders is inconsistent with the benevolent legislative purpose of according favored treatment to young persons.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee of the electric company testified that an examination of the electric meter that serviced defendant's business demonstrated that it had been tampered with so that the meter registered a lesser amount of electrical current than was actually being consumed. Defendant had testified that he had not tampered with the meter, had not procured anyone to do so, and had not known that such tampering had taken place. Under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 165.15(6) it was presumed that a user of electricity whose supply of electricity was not being properly measured by reason of meter tampering had knowledge of such tampering.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In order for a statutorily created criminal presumption to be constitutional, the facts presumed must have &quot;a natural, not an unreasonable or unnatural, connection with facts proven&quot;.  The test is whether, based on life and life's experience, a rational connection between the fact presumed and ultimate fact presumed may be said to exist and whether it is logical and fair to impose the burdens of the presumption on the defendant in the circumstances of the particular case.  A criminal presumption is violative of due process &quot;unless it can at least be said with substantial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend&quot;.</SPAN></P>

Subdivision 6 of section 165.15 of the Penal Law, which creates the presumption that a user of electricity whose supply of electricity is not being properly measured by reason of meter tampering, has knowledge of such tampering, does not invalidly shift the burden of proof to defendant.  The ultimate burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to all of the elements of the crime charged always remains with the prosecution.  A presumption merely provides a method whereby certain facts are deemed to be prima facie proof of other facts.  The question of whether defendant had knowledge of the tampering of the meter must still be proven by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt despite the presumption.</SPAN></P>

The deputy sought cancellation of the hearings and reinstatement. The court held that such proceedings were subject to U.S. Const. amend.

The court found that the deputy could not be disciplined for refusal to answer the sheriff's questions. The court held that the deputy could invoke his right against self-incrimination under U.S. Const. amend. V and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, because the information sought about the meeting went beyond narrow questions about the performance of his duties, and, further, the deputy had the constitutional right to refuse to disclose his conversations with his attorney.

Despite noting that the county was entitled to take all steps necessary, including inspections of any buildings in which welfare recipients would reside, to determine whether the condition of such buildings was dangerous or otherwise unsuitable for their occupancy, the court refused to dismiss the complaint because a question of fact arose in view of the landlord's contention that the rule requiring inspection of such rental apartments had not been uniformly applied, and that, in the application of such rule, the county had discriminated against the landlord. A hearing was therefore necessary to resolve the question of fact. Moreover, dismissal of the complaint was not the proper remedy to obtain the joinder of a necessary party to the action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Syracuse City Court (New York), which convicted appellant and which refused to treat him as a youthful offender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration. After plea negotiations, appellant was allowed to plead guilty to disorderly conduct and was sentenced to a $ 25 fine and a one-year conditional discharge. His request for youthful offender treatment was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 720 and the relief afforded by its provisions did not apply to appellant because, although he was an eligible youth within the stated age limitations, he was ultimately convicted of only a violation, rather than a crime. His was not a misdemeanor or felony, but only a petty offense under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 10.00. Because the purpose of the youthful offender status was to enable youthful wrongdoers to avoid convictions for crimes, the legislature's distinction had a rational basis in fact. If the legislature wanted to afford individuals youthful offender treatment for convictions of violations, they could have easily defined the term &quot;youth&quot; in N.Y. Crim. Proc.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, who pleaded guilty to the violation of disorderly conduct in a local criminal court after being originally charged with the crimes of resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration, is not entitled to mandatory youthful offender treatment, since, under CPL 720.20 (subd 1, par [b]), mandatory youthful offender treatment is only available to an &quot;eligible youth&quot; ultimately convicted of a &quot;crime&quot; not a violation.  The essential purpose of the youthful offender process is to enable a youthful wrongdoer to avoid the stigma and practical consequences of a conviction for a &quot;crime&quot;.  CPL article 720 does not mandate youthful offender treatment to those who are convicted of offenses which are not crimes, even if those individuals were in the first instance &quot;eligible youths&quot; charged with the commission of a crime. The availability of youthful offender treatment depends upon the ultimate adjudication of the matter not the seriousness of the crime originally charged. Had the Legislature wanted to afford individuals youthful&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  offender treatment for convictions of violations, they could have defined the term &quot;youth&quot; ( CPL 720.10) to include persons charged with offenses considered violations.  </SPAN></P>

The method of enforcement of the prostitution laws is sex biased, aimed only at punishing the female prostitute in that female plainclothes police officers are not assigned to pose as prostitutes to entrap male patrons while male undercover officers are assigned to pose as patrons to entrap streetwalkers.

The criminalization of &quot;deviate&quot; sexual intercourse only between unmarried persons (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 130.38, 130.00, subd 2) is an unconstitutional denial of equal protection of the laws since there is no logical or factual basis on which to distinguish between the private consensual conduct of married and unmarried persons.  There is no evidence that &quot;deviate&quot; sexual intercourse is more harmful to unmarried persons or that such conduct between unmarried persons is more harmful to the public.  There is no empirical evidence that &quot;deviate&quot; sexual intercourse is intrinsically harmful to the participants or that it has a deleterious effect on the moral fibre of the community by undermining the stability of marriage and the family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sodomy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Private, intimate, consensual sexual conduct not harmful to others whether &quot;deviate&quot; (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 130.38, 130.00, subd 2) or &quot;normal&quot; does not violate public morality and is constitutionally protected&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the right of privacy which protects the individual's right to engage in nonprocreative recreational sex. The mantle of constitutional protection surrounding personal intimacy is not limited to married persons.  Absent empirical evidence demonstrating that private, consensual &quot;deviate&quot; sexual acts cause harm in fact to the public health, safety or welfare, the State may not legitimately proscribe such conduct.  Since there is no proof that public harm is caused by consensual sodomy, the government may not intrude in private, personal decisions regarding sexual preference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Prostitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The attenuated relationship between prostitution and venereal disease makes it unreasonable to prohibit all prostitution for the sake of eradicating 5% of the venereal disease health hazard actually attributable to prostitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Prostitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Prostitution may not be proscribed as a means to eradicate ancillary crimes since there is no empirical evidence that prostitution in fact causes ancillary crimes.  Crimes ancillary to prostitution are a by-product of the environment to which society consigns prostitution. It is the criminalization of prostitution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and not prostitution itself that leads to ancillary crime.  The State must proceed against ancillary crimes directly by enforcing the specific sanctions against such conduct and may not rely on the blunderbuss approach of incarcerating all prostitutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Prostitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. It is improper and unreasonable for the State to proscribe prostitution as a method of curbing organized crime since there is no proof that prostitution is the cause in fact of organized crime. Rather than encourage the spread of organized crime, prostitution only plays a &quot;small and declining role in organized crime's operation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Prostitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Prostitution may not be proscribed on the ground that it is injurious to the community since there is no empirical connection between prostitution and the stability of marriage or the family.  The State cannot rely upon the bare assertion of immorality to justify a criminal prohibition.  Attempts by the State to regulate lifestyle choices on the bare assertion that the regulation serves morality are impermissible.  Conduct that does not interfere with the rights and interests of others may not be regulated by the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Prostitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. However offensive it may be, recreational commercial sex threatens no harm to the public health, safety or welfare and, therefore, may not be proscribed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Prostitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. While prostitution may not be proscribed since it threatens no harm to the public health, safety or welfare, the prohibition of the offensive public conduct associated with the solicitation of prostitution may be a legitimate State objective.  The public's right not to be repeatedly accosted on the streets by prostitutes may be protected by less intrusive means than those now employed without depriving the individual of his or her right to engage in private, consensual, sexual conduct which is protected by the right of privacy. It is unreasonable for the State to completely proscribe private, sexual conduct in order to reach distinct public solicitation.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorneys brought a N.Y. Civ. Prac.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After Buffalo, N.Y., Ordinance ch. 1, &sect; 4 was revised, the attorneys applied for a waiver from the requirement that they live within the city during their employment at the corporation counsel's office. Their requests were denied and they brought the proceeding to enjoin respondents from enforcing the ordinance. The court found that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court converted the action from a N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 proceeding, which was meant to test the action of a public official but not the constitutionality of a legislative enactment, to an action for a declaratory judgment to determine the constitutionality of the ordinance. The court found that there was a valid controversy because of the denial of the attorneys' applications for a waiver. The court looked at the meaning of the ordinance in conjunction with N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 75(3), which provided a variety of sanctions for misconduct. The court determined that the ordinance was invalid because removal from employment was mandated for nonresidency and it did not allow the hearing officer any discretion. The court found that the ordinance was not with the scope of &sect; 75(3) and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding Against Body or Officer -- Improper Use of Article 78 Proceeding to Test Constitutionality of Legislative Enactments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Since a CPLR article 78 proceeding is not the proper vehicle to test the constitutionality of legislative enactments, petitioners' article 78 proceeding to have the &quot;residency&quot; ordinance of the City of Buffalo requiring city employees to live within the city during their period of employment declared invalid is converted into an action for declaratory judgment pursuant to CPLR 103 (subd [c]).  Article 78 proceedings are available&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to determine whether a statute, ordinance or regulation has been applied in an unconstitutional manner, whereas a declaratory judgment tests the basic scope and validity of a statute pursuant to which officials are acting and is the proper vehicle to direct the nonenforcement of an unconstitutional law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioners, members of the office of the Corporation Counsel of the City of Buffalo who were denied permission to move outside the city, have standing to challenge the constitutionality of an ordinance requiring city employees to live within the city since they have a &quot;personal stake in the outcome of the controversy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Constitutionality of &quot;Residency&quot; Ordinance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The &quot;residency&quot; ordinance of the City of Buffalo, which requires city employees to reside within the city during their period of employment and provides that any employee who &quot;fails to comply&quot; with the residency requirement &quot;shall forfeit his employment and shall be removed therefrom&quot; following a &quot;hearing upon stated charges&quot;, is violative of subdivision 3 of section 75 of the Civil Service Law, which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  empowers the hearing officer to determine an appropriate penalty upon a finding of misconduct, and is therefore unconstitutional being a local law inconsistent with a general State law (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2, subd [c], par [ii]).  While an ordinance may validly categorize nonresidency as one form of misconduct for which removal may be an appropriate penalty, automatic removal upon a finding of nonresidency is completely contrary to the five penalties set forth in section 75 which may be assessed in the discretion of the hearing officer. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, recipients of public assistance, sought an adjudication punishing defendants, Commissioner of Social Services and his general counsel, for contempt for failing to comply with the court's order preliminarily enjoining them from implementing 1977 N.Y. Laws 77, &sect; 8, which amended New York's &quot;work rule.&quot; Plaintiffs also requested a summary judgment declaring &sect; 8 unconstitutional and permanently enjoining its enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were recipients of public assistance in the state's Home Relief Program, and the number of days of work to be given each person was originally determined pursuant to N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 164(3)(b) by the amount of budget deficit of the recipient and his family. However, 1977 N.Y. Laws &sect; 8 amended N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect;164(3)(b) to state that each person assigned to a public work project would be required to participate an average of three days per week without regard to the amount of the recipient's or his family's budget deficit. The court explained that 1977 N.Y. Laws &sect; 8 confronted the needy within its purview with two alternatives: either refuse to work and lose the home relief grant, or comply with the new law and work in a kind of involuntary servitude at a very low hourly rate for which no one would seriously expect an employee to work. The court granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and held that 1977 N.Y. Laws &sect; 8 was unconstitutional and violative of N.Y. Const. art. XVII, &sect; I, which guaranteed relief assistance to the needy. However, the court denied plaintiffs' motion to punish any disobedience on defendants' part.</SPAN></P>

N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect;&sect;50, 51 were not violated because the patient's name, portrait, or picture were not used. While New York did not recognize a common law right of privacy, the physician, by agreeing to provide medical attention, impliedly promised to keep in confidence matters uncovered during treatment. N.Y.C.P.L.R. 4504 embodied a public policy prohibiting disclosure of patient information. While the patient's right of privacy was not absolute, the psychiatrist and her husband failed to demonstrate that the publication represented a contribution to science. There was no issue of prior restraint because the book had already been published and found to violate the patient's privacy. The psychiatrist's husband was liable because he was a willing co-violator of the patient's rights. Because the psychiatrist and her husband had no motive to harm, punitive damages were not available.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Legislature, in excluding from CPLR 4504 (subd [a]) the opening words of section 354 of the Civil Practice Act, intended to reinforce the public policy of this State expressed in numerous statutes and regulations ( CPLR 4504, subd [a]; 4508; Education Law, &sect;&sect; 6509-6511; Mental Hygiene Law, &sect; 15.13, subds [c], [d]; &sect; 35.11; Public Health Law, &sect; 2803-c, subd 3, par f; &sect; 2805-e, subd 3; &sect; 3371; 8 NYCRR 60.1 [d] [3]) prohibiting physicians, persons in allied fields and medical institutions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from disclosing, without authorization of the patient, information discovered in attending the patient.</SPAN></P>

A physician, who enters into an agreement with a patient to provide medical attention, impliedly covenants to keep in confidence all disclosures made by the patient concerning the patient's physical or mental condition as well as all matters discovered by the physician in the course of examination or treatment.  This is particularly and necessarily true of the psychiatric relationship, for in the dynamics of psychotherapy the patient is called upon to discuss in a candid and frank manner personal matter of the most intimate and disturbing nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Physicians and Surgeons -- Unauthorized Disclosure of Patient's Confidences -- Remedies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Under the law of the State of New York in a proper case, the contract of private parties to retain in confidence matter which should be kept in confidence will be enforced by injunction and compensated in damages.  The implied covenant between psychiatrist and patient not to disclose information received during the course&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of treatment is such a contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Physicians and Surgeons -- Unauthorized Disclosure of Patient's Confidences -- Breach of Privacy under Civil Rights Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A complaint alleging unauthorized publication, verbatim, by a psychiatrist of a patient's disclosures during the course of a lengthy psychoanalysis does not state a cause of action for breach of privacy under sections 50 or 51 of the Civil Rights Law, since the patient's &quot;name, portrait or picture&quot; has not been used, or under a common-law right of privacy, since to date there has not been recognized in this State such a right.  It does, however, state a cause of action arising from two other sources: the public policy of the State of New York proclaimed by statute and regulation, which bars a physician from disclosing a patient's confidences, and the implied promise of confidentiality which every physician makes his patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Physicians and Surgeons -- Unauthorized Disclosure of Patient's Confidences</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Every patient, and particularly every patient undergoing psychoanalysis, has a right to privacy arising from the public policy of the State proclaimed by statute and regulation which bars the physician from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  disclosing a patient's confidences and from the implied promise of confidentiality which every physician makes his patient. The name affixed to the wrong of violating this right is unimportant since there is no necessity that a tort have a name; what is important is that there must be the infliction of intentional harm, resulting in damage, without legal excuse or justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Physicians and Surgeons -- Unauthorized Disclosure of Patient's Confidences -- Exceptions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Under the public policy of this State, a patient's right of confidentiality against unauthorized disclosure of his confidences is less than absolute, but in no case has the curiosity or education of the medical profession superseded such right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Physicians and Surgeons -- Unauthorized Disclosure of Patient's Confidences -- Injunction against Distribution of Book Containing as Prior Restraint</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Enjoining distribution of a book by a psychiatrist containing the verbatim disclosures of a patient made during the course of a lengthy psychoanalysis is not an unconstitutional &quot;prior restraint&quot; on publication thereof, since such book offends against the patient's right of privacy, contractual and otherwise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The defense of laches is groundless in an action by a patient to enjoin the unauthorized publication of a book by a psychiatrist containing the patient's verbatim disclosures during the course of a lengthy psychoanalysis, where, although publication occurred 10 years after the last discussion of the book and eight years after treatment had stopped, as soon as the patient heard of the impending publication she protested orally and in writing through her attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Physicians and Surgeons -- Unauthorized Disclosure of Patient's Confidences -- Liability of Third Party</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The husband of the psychiatrist author of an unauthorized book containing the verbatim disclosures of a patient during the course of a lengthy psychoanalysis, who knowing of its source manufactured, advertised and circulated the book, despite the fact he was not involved in a physician- patient or contractual relationship with the patient, is a coviolator of the patient's right of confidentiality and therefore equally liable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. As punitive damages or otherwise, attorneys' fees are not available in an action by a patient to enjoin the unauthorized publication of a book by a psychiatrist containing the verbatim disclosures of the patient during a lengthy psychoanalysis there being no statutory authority providing for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Physicians and Surgeons -- Unauthorized Disclosure of Patient's Confidences -- Punitive Damages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. In order to warrant an award of punitive damages, it must be affirmatively demonstrated that the wrong committed was willful and malicious. Accordingly, where defendant psychiatrist's acts in publishing an unauthorized book containing the verbatim disclosures of plaintiff patient during the course of a lengthy psychoanalysis were not willful, malicious or wanton, but merely stupid, punitive damages are not available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Physicians and Surgeons -- Unauthorized Disclosure of Patient's Confidences -- Compensatory Damages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. Further damaging publicity resulting from plaintiff patient's prosecution of a lawsuit brought in connection with unauthorized publication of a book by a psychiatrist revealing her verbatim disclosures during the course of a lengthy psychoanalysis&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  may not be considered in determining compensatory damages due plaintiff, since public policy requires persons be encouraged to assert legal rights and any loss resulting thereby should fall upon defendant whose conduct made the lawsuit necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Physicians and Surgeons -- Unauthorized Disclosure of Patient's Confidences -- Remedies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. Where in an action by a patient for damages for breach of privacy in connection with publication of a book by a psychiatrist relating the verbatim disclosures of the patient during the course of lengthy psychoanalysis damages alone do not provide an adequate remedy because should the book continue to circulate damage will accrue anew, plaintiff patient is entitled to a judgment permanently enjoining further violation of her right to privacy whether by further circulation of book or otherwise disclosing any matters revealed by plaintiff in the course of psychotherapy. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the new contract, sick days previously accumulated were retained, but could not be used during the first seven days of sickness, which was the waiting period under the Disability Benefits Law. However, these accumulated days could be used after an employee had exhausted benefits under the Disability Benefits Law. The employees claimed that the provision preventing them from using accumulated sick leave during the first seven days of sickness was unconstitutional because it deprived them of a vested property right and impaired the obligation of the contract. The court granted the motion and held that the resolution was constitutional. Whether the resolution impaired the obligation of the contract depended upon whether the employees had acquired any vested rights in accumulated sick days. Under the expired contract, the employees had no vested interest in their accumulated sick days, and the right to use of the benefits was contingent upon sickness during the period of employment. The accumulated days were lost upon termination of employment.</SPAN></P>

The town contended that the statutes violated the &quot;home rule&quot; protections of N.Y. Const. art.

The overall scheme of the act was to require local governments, under the supervision of the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, to adopt regulations for the purpose of contracting the use and development of wetlands.

The town contended that the statutes violated the &quot;home rule&quot; protections of the state constitution and impaired the power granted to the town in N.Y. Stat. Law &sect; 10(7). The court held that after reviewing the purposes and functions of the statutes in question, no supportive reasoning could categorize the preservation of natural resources as a matter of local concern. It was clear that the legislation in question addressed an issue of substantial state concern.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for murder in the first degree over 13 years ago. Thereafter, defendant was committed to a state hospital as incompetent to stand trial. According to defendant he had been confined in a criminal capacity for more than 13 years without being brought to trial and therefore sought conversion to civil status alleging violation of his constitutional rights of equal protection and due process. The issue before the court was whether defendant would again regain competency to stand trial in the reasonable future. The court held that the state had the burden of proving defendant's present mental state by a preponderance of the evidence. Moreover, the court held that defendant could not be retained in a criminal institution on the sole ground of dangerousness under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 730.50(1), (2), but he could be transferred to a civil institution which was able to supervise and treat potentially dangerous inmates such as defendant.

A person charged by a State with a criminal offense who is committed solely on account of his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  incapacity to proceed to trial cannot be held more than the reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that he will attain that capacity in the foreseeable future. If it is determined that this is not the case, then the State must either institute the customary civil commitment proceeding that would be required to commit indefinitely any other citizen, or release the defendant since the purpose for his initial hospitalization would no longer exist upon a finding that there was no substantial probability that the defendant would recover capacity to stand trial in the foreseeable future (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Jackson v Indiana</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 406 U.S. 715). Since there is no way of ascertaining whether a defendant is competent to stand trial in the future without first determining whether he is presently fit to proceed to trial, the same procedural rules applicable to a fitness proceeding ( CPL 730.50) are also applicable to a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Jackson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. While there is no statutory requirement ( CPL 730.50, subds 1, 2) that a finding on the issue of dangerousness be made in a hearing to determine whether an incapacitated defendant will attain competency in the foreseeable future thereby determining if he should be granted civil status (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Jackson v Indiana</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 406 U.S. 715), the question of dangerousness is, however, relevant in its relationship to a patient's mental condition either as a symptom of mental disorder or part of an underlying illness.  If the evidence of violence is so strong as to clearly label a defendant as dangerous, a court should highlight this fact although it cannot deny civil status to defendant on grounds of dangerousness. Dangerousness as an issue now lies only in the civil side of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Hearing to Convert Incapacitated Defendant From Criminal to Civil Status</SPAN></P>

VII, &sect; 11 that bond authorization be for a single work or purpose and asserted that the certification of the proposition language on the general election ballets was wrongful and illegal. The court awarded plaintiffs summary judgment and the relief they sought by finding that plaintiffs had standing. The court held that held that N.Y. State Fin. Law art. 7-A was not an exclusive remedy and that 1977 N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant public officer filed a claim to recover for unpaid salary from defendant state based on the allegedly illegal termination of his appointment as a member of the State Narcotic Addiction Control Commission (commission). He sought summary judgment on a claim for back pay and on a claim seeking damages for denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The public official's appointment as a member of the commission was terminated on April 8, 1975 by a letter from the governor, which referenced legislation that eliminated the commission. The public official filed a claim against the state to recover his back pay, asserting an unlawful termination. The trial court granted him summary judgment, but held that factual issues remained as to damages. A special provision granted gubernatorial removal power, but only for cause after an opportunity to be heard. 1973 N.Y. Laws 676. The governor's letter did not comply with this provision and thus, the termination was invalid. The trial court found that before the legislation abolishing the commission, 1975 N.Y. Laws 667, became law on August 6, 1975, the public official had the right to sue for his unpaid and statutorily fixed salary up to that date. His cause of action having accrued prior to the abolishing legislation, the legislation could not retroactively destroy it. The trial court declared 1975 N.Y Laws 667 unconstitutional to the extent that it attempted to retroactively deprive the public official of his statutorily fixed salary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the public official's motion for summary judgment as to the state's liability for back pay, but deferred ruling on the appropriate amount of back pay pending the parties' submission of papers to resolve that issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Claimant, who was appointed as a member of the former State Narcotic Addiction Control Commission, predecessor of the Drug Abuse Control Commission, the members of which had statutorily fixed terms, salaries and duties and were removable by the Governor for cause after an opportunity to be heard, and whose term was not due to expire until December 31, 1978, was notified on April 8, 1975 of the elimination of the commission and the termination of his services, but, in fact, the legislation abolishing the commission, chapter 667 of the Laws of 1975, did not become law until signed by the Governor on August 6, 1975, although it was expressly made retroactive to April 1, 1975.  He is entitled to summary judgment, as to liability only, on a cause of action by him for unlawful termination of his services on April 8, 1975 and for unpaid salary up to August 6, 1975.  Just before the subject enactment became law, he had the right to sue for his unpaid and statutorily fixed salary up to that date, and this right to enforce a legal cause of action had thus accrued prior to the legislation, and hence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  could not be retroactively destroyed thereby.  Furthermore, based on allegations by him of performance of his duties during the period in question, with respect to which the State raises no issue, he had, as of August 6, 1975, a valid claim on an implied in law contract for services performed theretofore, and such a claim has been characterized as a property right, and, as such, is entitled to constitutional protection.  In any event, whether denominated a property, vested or accrued right, or a cause of action, and whether enforceable as an incident to his public office, and its statutorily fixed salary, or in equity on the basis of an implied in law contract, claimant's entitlement to his salary up to August 6, 1975 was of such a fixed and substantial nature that the destruction of it by the retroactive application of chapter 667 of the Laws of 1975 was constitutionally impermissible.  Therefore, that chapter is unconstitutional to the extent that it attempts to retroactively deprive him of his statutorily fixed salary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There are insufficient facts to enable the court to fix the damages to which claimant is entitled on his cause of action for unpaid salary up to August 6, 1975, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and a hearing thereon will be required unless the parties can stipulate to the amount thereof or submit additional evidence to the court, including evidence of the period covered by his last salary payment and the basis on which he was customarily paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Neither claimant nor the State is entitled to summary judgment on a cause of action by him for salary from August 6, 1975 to December 31, 1975.  Allegations by him as to denial of equal protection and discrimination, based on the retention of two other commission members whose terms were to expire prior to his term, are merely conclusory, but, on the other hand, the State has presented nothing requiring dismissal of the cause of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. On a claim by him that chapter 667 of the Laws of 1975 was not timely signed by the Governor, claimant would have to establish by convincing proof that it was either not signed or signed on other than August 6, 1975, the date specified in the official Session Laws of the State, which are statutorily required to include the date a bill becomes a law with the Governor's approval, and which are accorded prima facie status, but he has merely raised the issue and presented no evidence with respect&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  thereto.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged charter provision authorized the county executive to determine and fix real property tax equalization rates among the various taxing districts of the county. The court held that, unless a statute specifically provided otherwise, legislative and discretionary powers vested in the governing body of a municipality could not be delegated to the administrative officials of the municipality. Pursuant to N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 800, the board of supervisors of each county was to be the county equalization agency. The court found no statutory authority for a county legislative body to transfer such power to a county executive.N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 33, which made all county charter provisions subject to restrictions in any other applicable law, did not provide authority for such transfers. Therefore, in a county charter, the obligation for county equalization had to remain with the county legislature or in its commissioners as designated by N.Y. Real Prop.

The application was denied pursuant to Town of Mexico, N.Y., Land Use Ordinance &sect; 540(4)(D), which restricted mobile homes to original owner units. The property owner challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance. The court, noting that a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding was not the proper vehicle for a determination of constitutionality, converted the proceeding into a declaratory judgment action. The court held that the town's lack of a master plan for land use did not invalidate its zoning laws under N.Y. Town Law &sect; 263, absent a showing that the town had ignored the general welfare of the community. The court determined, however, that the ordinance was an arbitrary and unreasonable restraint upon the owner's use of his property.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision 6-a of section 106 of the Alcoholic Beverages Control Law (L 1977, ch 321) which prohibits &quot;topless&quot; dancing in premises licensed for on-premises consumption of alcoholic beverages by the State Liquor Authority except in the case of a &quot;female entertainer performing on a stage or platform which is at least 18 inches above the immediate floor level and which is removed at least six feet from the nearest patron&quot; (9 NYCRR 53.1 [r], [s]), is not an unwarranted unconstitutional invasion of the freedom of expression. Nude dancing should be accorded only the &quot;barest minimum of protected expression&quot; under the First Amendment. A statute which prohibits females from appearing with uncovered breasts &quot;in any public place&quot; is unconstitutionally overbroad since such a statute would prohibit artistic and other socially redeeming works.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner ordered that shellfish harvesting in certain waters be stopped. The towns filed separate complaints against the commissioner challenging the orders. The trial court consolidated the two actions and dismissed all complaints against the commissioner. The court held that the commissioner was not required to hold a public hearing on the matter or to file an environmental impact study for the order. The court concluded that the testing method employed by the commissioner in concluding that the shellfish harvesting created a potentially harmful situation was a proper testing method and in no way violated the towns' due process rights. The court held that the commissioner's decision was not arbitrary or capricious but was based on the determination from the testing performed and the intensive analysis performed of the quality of the waters in question.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant Commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Conservation lawfully closed certain areas in the Great South Bay in Suffolk County to the harvesting of shellfish on public health grounds pursuant to ECL 13-0307 based upon valid scientific standards of testing utilizing the coliform testing methodology which constitutes the most accurate testing procedure presently available to ascertain the presence of harmful human pathogens in shellfish. While there may exist other possible procedures for detecting the presence of pollution in water, the scientific community has yet to develop such procedures to the degree that they are accepted as valid.  There exists no test other than the coliform indicator test which has the credentials of valid criteria, standardized methodology and economy.  Past outbreaks of various diseases have been associated with the harvesting of shellfish in waters having a higher reading&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  than 70 MPN (most probable number) per 100 milliliters as determined by the coliform test.  The testing criteria and methodology of sampling, utilized by the department, including the frequency of testing, the physical obtaining of water samples, the initial refrigerated storage of the samples, the laboratory testing of the samples and the ultimate analysis, all complied with acceptable scientific procedures.  Concerted action, both legislative and executive in the public sector, and industry-wide in the private sector, together with the utilization of vast expenditures of both private and public funds, must be undertaken to correct those conditions which are eroding and destroying an irreplaceable resource.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The orders issued by defendant commissioner designating certain shellfish waters as uncertified under ECL 13-0307 (6 NYCRR 41.3) were not subject to the notice and public hearing provisions of the State Administrative Procedure Act (L 1975, ch 167, as amd by L 1976, ch 935) since said orders are not a &quot;statement, regulation or code of general applicability that implements or applies law or prescribes the procedure or practice requirements of any agency&quot; (State Administrative&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Procedure Act, &sect; 102, subd 2, par [a], cl [i]).  ECL 13-0307 which mandates the issuance of the commissioner's orders designating the shellfish waters as uncertified provides merely for the publication of such certification as giving proper notice of the commissioner's actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The acts of the commissioner in filing a negative environmental impact statement pursuant to his statutory obligation to determine for public health reasons whether or not certain waters are suitable for the harvesting of shellfish, were not subject to the notice and hearing requirements of ECL 8-0109 which is concerned with the issue of preserving environmental, human and community resources of the State and does not concern itself with any of the issues of public health and safety which are involved in the certification of shellfish waters. In any event, the Department of Environmental Conservation is exempt from the necessity of preparing any environmental impact statement and from conducting public hearings involving its own actions.  The department's failure to give adequate consideration to environmental issues may be judically reviewed.  The commissioner should not be obliged to cease in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  middle of shellfish land certification proceedings having public health consequences in order to conduct hearings bearing upon the nature and effect of his actions.  </SPAN></P>

The mortgagee later commenced a foreclosure action against the mortgagor, and a receiver was appointed for the mortgagor. Counsel filed an application requesting to be paid from the receiver's account for legal services rendered to the mortgagor in the two prior actions and the foreclosure action. The court denied the application. The court found that the order of appointment of the receiver was not broad enough to authorize the receiver to obtain counsel for litigation involved in the two prior actions in which counsel was retained by the mortgagor before the receiver was appointed and before the foreclosure action was commenced. The court held that the receiver could not have been bound for payment of legal fees in the litigation because it would have made counsel a preferred creditor without any authority in law. The court noted that the legal services were rendered to the mortgagor and were not services rendered to the receiver. The court held that the legal fees were a debt of the mortgagor and that counsel was a general creditor.</SPAN></P>

The legal services rendered by petitioner, which resulted in the reduction of the annual tax assessment against defendant's property, were services rendered to to defendant corporation and were not services rendered to the receiver for which the funds in the hands of the receiver are primarily chargeable. Whatever obligation defendant had incurred to petitioner for legal services rendered to it as the client of petitioner in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  proceedings prior to the appointment of the receiver was a debt of the corporation, not a charge against the property in the hands of receiver. The receiver cannot be compelled to pay the expenses incurred by defendant in prior proceedings.  In addition, the receiver may not assume the obligation for legal fees for protracted litigation so as to bind his funds as receiver without being expressly authorized by court order ( CPLR 6401, subd [b]).  Compelling the receiver to pay petitioner's legal fees from his account would improperly elevate the status of petitioner from a general creditor to a lienor or preferred creditor giving petitioner priority over plaintiff mortgagee to proceeds of the foreclosure sale and also priority over the other lienors whose liens and respective priorities are established by statute.  Any payment to petitioner from the receiver's account would reduce the amount of any surplus or increase any deficiency in the proceeds and thereby reduce the amount of payment to any mechanics' lienors who have duly perfected their liens.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the Texas court had personal jurisdiction of the debtor because he voluntarily appeared in Texas in connection with the litigation and entered an answer to the complaint. There was likewise no objection to the subject matter jurisdiction of the Texas court. The debtor, who was also an attorney, argued he misunderstood the rules of the Texas court. This court found that was not valid attack on the default judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, Department of Social Services, brought suit to terminate the parental rights of respondent parents on the ground of permanent neglect. The two children at issue were previously adjudicated as neglected children and placed in the custody of the Department for a period of 18 months. The parents were directed to co-operate and fully participate in a plan of rehabilitation involving various services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner alleged that for more than one year the parents had failed to maintain contact with the children and also failed to plan for their children's future, although able to do so. The petitions further alleged that the parents had failed to co-operate with the Department in attempts to strengthen the parental relationship and to follow the rehabilitative plan. The parents moved to dismiss the petitions on the grounds that New York's permanent neglect statute was unconstitutional for vagueness and infringement of their First Amendment rights of privacy and denied them equal protection of the laws. The court rejected the parents' arguments and denied their motion to dismiss. The court ruled that the statute in question more than adequately satisfied the constitutional requirement for definiteness under the due process clause. The court found that the parents were not in a position to complain that they lacked sufficient notice of what was expected of them. The court further held that the statute on its face did not treat persons similarly situated differently nor did it reveal any distinctions in the treatment of the respondents or indeed any parent or child on &quot;suspect&quot; bases.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. New York's permanent neglect statute (Social Services Law, &sect; 384-b) which permits termination of parental rights of parents whose children are in the care and custody of an authorized agency solely on the basis of the &quot;failure to plan for the future of the child&quot; irrespective of the qualitative and quantitative substantiality of continued contacts with the child by the parents, is not unconstitutionally vague since the statute gives parents adequate notice of what they must do to avoid losing parental rights. The purpose of permitting termination of parental rights on the basis of either the failure to keep in contact or the failure to plan is to avoid the deleterious effects of protracted foster care by freeing children for adoption when parents insist upon retaining formal ties to their child but are unwilling to take the necessary steps within their power and ability to restore the child to their home.  The requirement of the parent to &quot;plan for the future of the child&quot; means not only to formulate, but also to accomplish a &quot;realistic and feasible&quot; plan to restore the child to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a permanent, &quot;stable home&quot; (Social Services Law, &sect; 384-b, subd [7], par [c]).  Consideration may be given to the &quot;failure of the parent to utilize medical, psychiatric, psychological and other social and rehabilitative services and material resources made available&quot;.  Respondents totally failed to follow through on the &quot;plan&quot; contained in the order of disposition in the previous neglect proceeding wherein specific programs for the rehabilitation of the family unit were set forth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The State's legitimate concern in preventing the evils of protracted foster care and their children's right to continuous care in a stable, permanent home environment take precedence over respondents' right to privacy to rear their children as they wish.  Respondents forfeited any absolute right to the privacy of their child-rearing decisions when they admitted to neglect in the previous proceeding.  New York's permanent neglect statute safeguards parental rights by requiring diligent agency efforts to strengthen the parental relationship and parental physical and financial ability to keep in contact and plan, before an adjudication of permanent neglect may be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The permanent neglect statute,&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by subjecting only parents whose children are in the care of an authorized agency to the sanction of termination of parental rights for permanent neglect, does not unconstitutionally discriminate against such parents.  The statute itself does not create any class of parents, but instead deals with a class of children.  Parents only become affected by the statute through their own actions by the neglect, abuse or abandonment of the child or the voluntary transfer of the child into foster care. </SPAN></P>

The administrative remedy set forth in section 1138 is the exclusive remedy available to &quot;any person&quot; seeking review of the tax liability imposed (Tax Law, &sect; 1140).  Judicial review is and was precluded to the assignee since the petitions for review filed with the State Tax Commission by the assignor and the &quot;individuals determined to be responsible for the sales and withholding taxes&quot; are still pending.  The assignee is bound by the provisions of the Tax Law setting forth the method of reviewing the tax liability imposed.  An assignee never stands in any better position than his assignor.

Jud. Law &sect; 148-a, the matter was referred to the panel for a hearing. The panel found that the other doctor was not liable, but did not make any findings with respect to defendants. Defendants then filed a motion to reconvene the panel to make specific findings or, in the alternative, to quash the findings made by the panel. The court denied the motion. The court held that although it was most sympathetic to defendants' position and was fully aware that without specific findings many problems were created, the panel was not required under &sect; 148-a to make specific findings. A panel finding was only required to concern itself merely with liability. The type of relief requested by defendants was a matter for legislative action if such body deemed it in the interest of the public.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical malpractice panel consisting of a Justice of the Supreme Court, a medical doctor and an attorney (Judiciary Law, &sect; 148-a) is not required to make specific findings when making its recommendation as to the question of liability in a medical malpractice action.  The medical malpractice panel in this case found no liability on the part of defendant doctor and made no findings with respect to defendant hospital and its employee.  The panel hearings are informal with no stenographic record.  There are no sworn witnesses nor any cross-examination. A unanimous panel finding on the question of liability may be read to the jury which must pass upon the probative value or weight of such panel finding.  The statute states that a unanimous panel finding shall concern itself solely with liability.  There is no direction to make specific findings.  However, if the doctor member or the attorney member of the panel is called as a witness with reference to the unanimous recommendation of the panel as authorized by subdivision 8 of section 148-a, such witness panelist may be examined as to the basis&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon which the panel finding was made.  The failure to permit questioning of the panelists concerning the panel's specific findings would violate due process and would negate the mandate of the Legislature to have the jury pass upon the probative value of the panel findings.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner municipalities brought a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 against respondents, the Commissioner of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, the Governor of the State of New York, and the Budget Director of the State of New York.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipalities brought an action against respondents asserting that the Commissioner's act of setting a certain date as the date in which municipalities' fiscal years ended was arbitrary and capricious and allowed some municipalities to qualify for a higher rate of reimbursement for sewage treatment expenses. The municipalities argued that the fiscal year of each municipality controlled; the State argued that the State's fiscal year controlled. The court concluded that the fiscal year was that provided for by statute. The municipalities also challenged an impoundment of the Department's appropriated funds by the Governor, allegedly to balance the state budget. The court concluded that the reduction of the appropriation by more than 25 percent of the amount appropriated was an attempt by executive edict to defeat the legislative intent of the law passed by the state legislature. The impoundment of appropriated funds was without authority in law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the Commissioner to recompute reimbursement rates to the municipalities and to restore the impounded sum to the Department's budget for dispersement to the municipalities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent Commissioner of Environmental Conservation improperly set varying rates of reimbursement to municipalities under ECL 17-1905 for operation and maintenance of sewage treatment plants, based upon their fiscal years.  ECL 17-1905 does not allow such varying rates within the same year and establishes the year beginning June 1 for purposes of reimbursement. Accordingly, the rates should be recomputed and reimbursement paid uniformly within the confines of the appropriated funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Governor and the Director of the Budget improperly impounded seven million dollars of the amount appropriated by the Legislature for the pure waters program.  The Governor has the right to line veto items of an appropriation subject to the Legislature's right to override the veto, and by impounding the funds without line veto, the Legislature was deprived of the right to legislate appropriation bills.  An interchange of appropriations is limited to a 5% charge under section 51 of the State Finance Law and the impoundment resulted in a charge exceeding 25%.  Accordingly, the sum should be restored to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the budget of the Department of Environmental Conservation and dispersed to the appropriate municipalities. </SPAN></P>

The court treated respondents' request as a motion for summary judgment on the constitutionality of the order.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent Governor had no authority to require all contractors, as part of every State construction contract, to establish affirmative action programs which must include &quot;goals and timetables&quot; for minority hiring as prescribed by the State Division of Human Rights (Executive Order No. 45; 9 NYCRR 3.45).  The sanctions for violating Executive Order No. 45 or of any regulations or orders adopted by the Commissioner of Human Rights thereunder include withholding of contract payments, termination or suspension of the contract and a declaration of ineligibility for future contracts for a two-year period.  Legislation prohibiting discrimination in employment requires executive enforcement.  Executive action in enforcing such legislation may not go beyond stated legislative policy and prescribe a remedial device not embraced by the policy.  An executive order which extends and expands statutory requirements does not serve the enforcement function and therefore constitutes an unwarranted exercise of legislative power. By empowering the Division of Human Rights to prescribe &quot;goals and timetables&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for minority hiring by contractors, the executive order improperly vests the division with broad authority beyond any legislative mandate to establish employment proportions and percentages.  The statutory enforcement procedure for remedying discrimination in employment only authorizes the Division of Human Rights to act on complaints of discriminatory employment practices by fashioning appropriate remedial orders on a case-by-case basis (Executive Law, &sect; 297). The legislative scheme regarding discrimination in employment permits but does not require employers to establish affirmative action plans (Executive Law, &sect; 296, subd 12).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board's budget included appropriations for pension and health insurance expenses, and capital reserve. The appropriations were justified under 1976 N.Y. Laws 349, or the Emergency City and School District Relief Act, and 1976 N.Y. Laws 484. The taxpayer commenced a declaratory judgment action to have the appropriations declared unconstitutional, contending that they exceeded the constitutional tax ceiling. The Board contended that an emergency situation permitted certain budgetary appropriations to be excluded from the tax limitation. The court rejected the Board's argument, and held that Chapters 349 and 484, as well as the health insurance and pension appropriations were unconstitutional; the court made no ruling on the capital reserve issue. The court held that the appropriations were contrary to the law and that they were outside the limitations placed in N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 10. The court held that the Board's budget crisis did not fit the definition of an emergency, which the court defined as an unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting state that calls for immediate action.</SPAN></P>

Since the gift was made in contemplation of death, it is to be treated as part of the estate passing at death, as if the earlier transfer had not been made.  While it has been held unconstitutional to tax tangible personal property located outside of the State, such holding did not involve a gift in contemplation of death and should not limit New York's power to tax in that situation.  </SPAN></P>

The court denied injunctive relief on several claims because they were not recognized rights under the Constitution.

The complaint is also dismissed as against the county, for lack of jurisdiction to grant any relief as against it under section 1983, since liability under that section is asserted against every person who, under color of State law, subjects another to the deprivation of any constitutional rights, and a county or other subdivision of State government is not a &quot;person&quot; within the meaning of the section, either for purposes of legal or equitable relief.  Nor could the county be found derivatively liable through one of the remaining defendants, the Sheriff of the county and the Superintendent of the jail. Nor is the doctrine of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">respondeat superior</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> applicable in actions brought under section 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Good faith is a defense which need not have been affirmatively pleaded in this action under section 1983, but, if a violation of civil rights were established and good faith were to become an issue, the Sheriff and the Superintendent would bear the burden of proving that defense, which, even if established, would not prevent the court from granting equitable relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. No constitutional deprivation warranting relief&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is found with respect to claims made by plaintiffs concerning restrictions on their incoming and outgoing mail; restrictions on their use of personal stationery; restrictions on their receipt of books and publications; restrictions on their visitation privileges; restrictions on their use of telephones; alleged improper conduct of disciplinary proceedings; alleged improper exclusion of women inmates from a particular phase of a rehabilitation program; restrictions on their use of gymnasium facilities; lack of rehabilitation programs for unsentenced inmates; denial of bail to indigent pretrial detainees; alleged restrictions on access to counsel; alleged invalidity of regulations regarding punishment of inmates for infractions; alleged lack of a proper classification system separating inmates according to the security risk involved, and lack of outdoor exercise or recreation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Declaratory and injunctive relief is granted with respect to claims by plaintiffs concerning lack of paying jobs for women inmates, as contrasted to those for male inmates; the conditions under which women inmates are housed, including the size of their cells, as contrasted to the conditions under which male&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  inmates are housed; overcrowded facilities, and a failure to furnish inmates with personal hygiene items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. No legal liability is found as against the Sheriff or the Superintendent of the jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In the exercise of the court's discretion, no attorneys' fees are awarded to either plaintiffs' counsel or defendants' counsel, nor are costs awarded to any party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. It is noted that the ultimate responsibility for maintaining the jail lies with the county, against which the court has no power to grant relief in this action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. If it is necessary to release inmates to comply with the directions made by the court, priority of release is to be given to those inmates held for the longest time under the lowest bail, but the court will defer to any alternative method or priority of release which may hereafter be established by the State Commission of Correction.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners were unlawfully removed from their positions on the Zoning Board of Appeals of the Town of Onondaga by respondent town board pursuant to an unconstitutional provision of the town code of ethics which forbids any &quot;town officer, employee or any member of the Town Board; Planning Board; Zoning Board of Appeals or any other Town administrative board, commission or agency&quot; from also serving as a &quot;political committeeman or committeewoman &quot;or as the chairman or vice-chairman of a political party. Article 18 of the General Municipal Law which authorized the town to &quot;adopt standards relating to the conduct of officers and employees&quot; in order to avoid conflicts of interests, was not intended to include &quot;political activity&quot; among the types of conflicts of interest to be prohibited.  There is no conflict of interest between the positions of a member of a zoning board of appeals and officer of a town political committee. A common-law incompatibility of public offices is not present since a political party officer or member of a political party committee does not hold a public office. The restraint&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  placed on &quot;political activity&quot; by the town code of ethics violates petitioner's First Amendment rights to associate for political purposes.  Respondent town board has failed to demonstrate a compelling governmental interest justifying the restriction placed on &quot;political activity&quot;.  There is no benefit conferred upon the public which outweighs the restraints on constitutional rights. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action was brought by the department to abate the discharge of sewage emanating from the property owners' homes, which were built by defendant construction company. The construction company had secured a permit to construct a sanitary sewage treatment plant from the department to process the waste from the property owners' homes. It failed to comply with the permit, abandoned the sewer system, and discharged untreated waste into a creek. The owners set forth two affirmative defenses and a counterclaim against the department. They demanded judgment declaring that the relief sought by the department constituted an unconstitutional deprivation of property. The property owners alleged that the department improperly issued the permit to the construction company and failed to make required inspections and was, therefore, responsible for the defects. The court granted the department's motion and held that the issuance of the permit was a discretionary act under N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 17-0701, so even if the department's commissioner, as an employee of the State, erred in issuing the permit, the State was not liable for the results of the performance of a discretionary act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, charged with robbery in the first degree and related offenses, brought a motion for dismissal of the indictment and for other forms of relief on the ground of discriminatory prosecution in connection with his treatment as a major offender by the district attorney.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district attorney's office instituted a major offense program that identified cases in which the crime was particularly heinous or the alleged offender was a serious recidivist, and selected those cases for prosecution marked by limited plea bargaining, full disclosure to defense counsel, immediate and thorough case preparation, and the assignment of a single assistant district attorney to handle a given case from inception to conclusion. Defendant challenged his selection for inclusion in the major offense program on equal protection and due process grounds. The gravamen of the motion was that, by being cast as a defendant in the accelerated prosecution program, defendant was being deprived of the right to be treated the same as other defendants in the criminal process. The court dismissed defendant's motion because the program was constitutionally sound. It did not offend due process by by-passing the felony complaint hearing because such hearing was not constitutionally required where there had been a grand jury indictment. Also, the courts, by establishing the program, properly exercised the power to dispose of cases and ease the chronic problem of trial delay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment because the speedy disposition of criminal cases that the major offender program allowed for was constitutionally sound.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- accelerated prosecution of major offenders -- due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's accelerated prosecution as a major felony offender by the Bronx County major offense bureau did not violate any of his constitutional rights in the criminal process. The purpose of the Federally assisted program of accelerated prosecution is to insure swift and certain justice for the perpetrators of serious crimes and repeat offenders. The median time between arrest and case disposition under the major offense program is 97 days compared to a median time of 400 days for all other felony cases prosecuted by the Bronx County District Attorney.  Special parts of the Supreme Court in Bronx County are set aside solely to hear cases prosecuted by the major offense bureau. Plea bargaining, which is not a constitutional right, is severely limited.  The District Attorney, in discharging the duties of his office, has the right to focus greater attention upon the prosecution of those charged with serious crimes and the career criminal.  A program of accelerated prosecution involving the selective prosecution of perpetrators of serious crimes or repeat offenders&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  does not constitute an unconstitutional invidious classification since an individual is not prosecuted on the basis of race, religion or some other arbitrary classification. The major offense program does not involve selective enforcement.  A defendant not selected for prosecution under the program is prosecuted nonetheless.  Absent the denial of some constitutionally protected right, a program of accelerated prosecution does not offend due process concepts.  There is a rational basis for distinguishing between major offenders and those charged with lesser crimes.  The prosecution of any case under the major offense program does not deprive a defendant of sufficient time to prepare an adequate defense.  The denial of a preliminary hearing does not violate due process where there has been a Grand Jury indictment. The Bronx County Grand Jury has returned 99% of the indictments originating from the major offense bureau within three days of arrest thereby averting the felony hearing which is mandated within 72 hours of arraignment ( CPL 180.80).  Finally, a defendant prosecuted as a major offender is not unduly prejudiced by the fact that the Judge is aware of his past criminal record. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord moved for a preliminary injunction restraining defendant tenant from enforcing New York City, N.Y., Health Code &sect; 131.15 on the ground that it was unconstitutional, at least as applied to the landlord. The tenant cross-moved for an order dismissing the complaint pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211 or alternatively for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord challenged the constitutionality of &sect;131.15 requiring him to install window guards in an apartment where a child under 10 years of age resided. He contended that compliance was a confiscatory financial burden, and there was no rational relationship between the installation of window guards and the prevention of window falls. Economic injury was the only damage alleged. The court held that economic damage was not a ground for an injunction. The court noted that there was a rational relationship between the requirement of window guards and the appropriate objective, within the police power, the prevention of children from falling from windows. The court found the landlord's allegation that &sect; 131.15 was unconstitutional as applied to him due to a economic hardship was without merit. There were costs imposed by requirements involving the maintenance and operation of residential buildings, imposed for public well-being. That a statute or regulation resulted in reduced income, imposed additional costs or other pecuniary injury, or even made it impossible for some to continue in business, did not establish unconstitutionality where exercise of the police power was involved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the landlord's motion and granted the cross-motion to the extent of directing a judgment that the relative sections of the New York City Health Code were valid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 131.15 of the New York City Health Code, which requires the installation of window guards in apartments where children under the age of 10 reside and in the hallway windows of such buildings, is constitutional.  There is a rational relationship between the requirement of window guards and the proper objective of the statute, within the police power, the prevention of children from falling from windows. Moreover, a statute or regulation which results in an economic burden being placed on a particular landlord does not establish unconstitutionality where exercise of the police power is involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 131.15 of the Health Code is not invalid as a violation of the rent control provisions of chapters 371 and 1012 of the Laws of 1971, which prohibit a municipality from adopting any regulation affecting rent control housing more stringent than those in effect prior to June&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  30, 1971, without first obtaining the approval of the State Division of Housing. These provisions were not intended to restrict a municipality in adopting public safety legislation or regulations for purposes other than rent regulation even though more stringent than those in effect prior to 1971 and even though they may affect rent controlled housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 131.17 of the New York City Health Code, which provides a mechanism whereby those who find it difficult to comply with section 131.15 may seek a modification of its requirements from the Commissioner of Health, has not been shown to be unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

The employees brought an action against the county seeking to compel the county to pay salary increases that were adopted by the legislature. The lower court ruled in favor of the county. On appeal, the employees claimed that the withholding of their salary increases was discriminatory, arbitrary, and capricious, and violated their right to equal protection of the law.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The requirement of section 115 of the Civil Service Law, that employees earn equal pay for equal work, applies only to State employees and not municipal civil service employees. Accordingly, the statute is not violated by a determination of respondent county to withhold salary increases from certain nonunion employees, while paying increases to union employees and other nonunion employees holding similar positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent violated the equal protection guarantees of the State and Federal Constitutions by withholding salary increases from petitioners, since its salary grade plan has the force and effect of local law and it may not arbitrarily discriminate among individuals holding positions in the same salary grade, based upon union status, for purposes of fiscal economy.  The economic objective must be accomplished by a consistent and equitable plan, while the basis for petitioner's nonunion status bears no relation to respondent's fiscal situation.  Accordingly, respondent's actions are null and void. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Movants, holders of short-term notes of the City of New York, may not intervene and be granted class action status in the continuing litigation resulting from the declared unconstitutionality of the New York State Emergency Moratorium Act for the City of New York (L 1975, ch 874, as amd by ch 875) which purported to postpone the payment of certain short-term anticipation notes issued by the city (see 40 NY2d 731), for the purposes of proposing &quot;an offer of settlement to the City of New York&quot; and filing a notice of appeal from the judgment awarding 6% interest from the date of maturity rather than the face rate (see 88 Misc 2d 1047). Pursuant to the remittitur issued by the Court of Appeals (40 NY2d 1094), the interest rate, a method of payment, deferments, safeguards and remedies have already been provided for.  The delay attendant upon movants' intervention and the consideration of their proposals would serve only to disrupt the presently accelerated progress of the processing of the noteholders' applications for judgments and the entry and payment of the resultant judgments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2.  Movants' attorney, who, as an associate of the law firm which acted as bond counsel to defendant Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC), worked on legal matters related to MAC's and the city's budget, is disqualified from serving as counsel in this or any related proceeding.  Movants' attorney had access to files and confidential materials.  His representation of movants would violate cannon 4 of the Code of Professional Responsibility which prohibits a lawyer from using &quot;information acquired in the course of the representation of a client to the disadvantage of the client&quot;.  Such representation would also violate canon 9 which prohibits a lawyer leaving &quot;public employment&quot; from accepting private employment &quot;in connection with any matter in which he had substantial responsibility prior to his leaving&quot;.  The fact that movants' attorney waived compensation is irrelevant since the receipt of compensation is not a determinative test of ethical behavior.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, comptroller, county, and city, filed motions to dismiss the complaint of plaintiffs, public interest group and citizens, for lack of legal capacity to sue the county and city, for expiration of the limitation period, for failure to state a claim, and for laches. The public interest group and the citizens sought summary judgment on their claim to void a public improvement contract and to enjoin disbursement of payments related to it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The public interest group and the citizens brought an action against the comptroller, the county, and the city, for relief from a public improvement contract that created a debt in violation of N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 11. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the contract was void and sought to enjoin the comptroller's disbursement of rental or supplemental contract payments to the county. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint, contending that it was time barred, stated no claim, and that standing was lacking. Plaintiffs sought summary judgment. The court granted defendants' motions, concluding that the cause of action arose on the date of the contract's execution, which rental payments did not extend. An action was risible against the city and the county by eligible taxpayers from the time of the contract's execution. Moreover, security agreements arose out of the contract in the form of bonds and pledges against rentals from the buildings that were constructed. Based on the foregoing, the doctrine of laches barred the complaint, which made a delayed demand for relief approximately 12 years after the contract's execution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An action for a judgment declaring that an agreement executed May 11, 1965 between the State of New York, the County of Albany and the City of Albany providing for the acquisition of land in the city and its transfer to the county on which land the county was to construct office buildings, a museum and an auditorium to State specifications (the so-called South Mall), the construction to be financed by county bonds with rentals to be paid by the State, is void as creating a State debt in violation of the State Constitution, is barred by the six-year Statute of Limitations.  The contract is alleged to create an unconstitutional State debt, not the annual rental payments, and, therefore, the cause of action arose on the execution of the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although citizen taxpayers had no cause of action as such until the decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Boryszewski v Brydges</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (37 NY2d 361) and the enactment of article 7-A of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State Finance Law in 1975, they did have the right to sue the city and county under section 51 of the General Municipal Law prior thereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The action is also barred by laches. There was a delay of 12 years in the commencement of the action.  The action would deprive investors in county bonds of security and the county would be beyond its debt limit and unable to borrow money for essential purposes.  Further, the buildings would be valueless for the most part to anyone except the State.  </SPAN></P>

As such, the award of costs under &sect; 1902 should have been unrelated to attorney's fees and to any consideration of whether the party was represented by an attorney. By adding the phrase &quot;if he has appeared by attorney,&quot; the legislators treated some parties differently from other parties and denied equal treatment under the laws of the state to certain persons in a class not denied to others in that class.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of promoting obscene materials. Defendants argued that under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 235.15(1), they could not have known with reasonable certainty when promotion of obscene materials was protected and when it was not. The court noted that &sect; 235.15(1) provided an affirmative defense to an alleged violation of promoting obscene materials when persons disseminating such materials did so to persons using them for educational, governmental, scientific, &quot;or other similar&quot; reasons. First, the court held that &sect; 235.15(1) did not present a problem of equal protection of the laws, since such equal protection was guaranteed to persons, rather than to activities. However, the court then held that the statute, especially the provision regarding &quot;similar&quot; reasons, was without reasonably definitive limits, so that it was in fact unconstitutionally vague. Accordingly, the court vacated the verdict against defendants and dismissed the informations.</SPAN></P>

Section 235.05 (subd 1) of the Penal Law, providing that a &quot;person is guilty of obscenity in the second degree when, knowing its contents and character, he * * * Promotes, or possesses with intent to promote, any obscene material&quot;, in conjunction with section 235.15 (subd 1) of the Penal Law, providing that &quot;In any prosecution for obscenity, it is an affirmative defense that the persons to whom allegedly obscene material was disseminated * * * consisted of persons * * * having scientific, educational, governmental or other similar justification for possessing * * * the same&quot;, does not adequately advise a would-be seller of obscene material what sales are criminal and what are not, since section 235.15 (subd 1) fails to define with reasonable clarity those uses which will justify possession of the material.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a writ of habeas corpus contending that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 250.20 was vague, overbroad, violated due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, and unlawfully violated his right to protected speech under the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A confidential informant divulged the existence of the wiretap order to petitioner. Petitioner was prosecuted under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 250.20 for divulging an eavesdropping warrant. Petitioner contended that his detention was unlawful. The court granted the writ and found that &sect; 250.20 outlawed speech and affected expression which was sheltered by the First Amendment. The court held that a valid government interest existed for the state to insure confidentiality. Section 250.20 could apply to a certain class of citizens, but under no circumstances could the statute apply to petitioner. Petitioner's act could not be independently unlawful. The court construed &sect; 250.20 so as to narrow its proscription and, by doing so, avoided the necessity of determining the need to strike the entire statute as unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- divulging eavesdropping warrant -- constitutionality of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, who learned of the existence of an eavesdropping warrant from the confidential informant whose information was the basis for the issuance of the interception order, allegedly told the party being investigated that his phone was being tapped, and was charged with divulging an eavesdropping warrant, in violation of section 250.20 of the Penal Law, which provides that a &quot;person is guilty of divulging an eavesdropping warrant when, possessing information concerning the existence or content of an eavesdropping warrant * * * he discloses such information to another person; except that such disclosure is not criminal or unlawful when made to a state or federal agency specifically authorized by law to receive reports concerning eavesdropping warrants, or when made in a legal proceeding, or to a law enforcement officer or agency connected with the application for such warrant, or to a legislative committee or temporary state commission, or to the telephone or telegraph corporation whose facilities are involved.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On defendant's writ of habeas corpus, he is discharged from custody, on the ground that section 250.20 is unconstitutional as applied to him.  The statute limits speech, and, while the restraint imposed by it might be reasonable and the governmental interest sufficiently compelling so as to override First Amendment considerations if it was applied to a certain class of citizens, such as one who, in his official capacity, unlawfully divulges the existence of an eavesdropping warrant, it makes no distinction as to the status of its prospective targets, but seeks to prohibit public employee and private citizen alike from disclosing information, making the mere transmission of information, by anyone to anyone, a crime.  As to a private citizen such as defendant, who is neither an official nor an employee of the State, was in no way connected with the original wiretap proceeding, and had no knowledge of it until he was told about it by the confidential informant, after the order had been obtained, the statute is an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of the police power of the State, infringing upon his guaranteed liberties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In view of the holding that the statute is unconstitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as applied to defendant, the issue of whether it is unconstitutional on its face is not considered.  However, a redrafting of it might be prudent, since a proper target who would have no justifiable claim of unconstitutionality as to himself, might, nevertheless, prevail on the constitutional issue by claiming that its overbreadth made it so sweeping on its face that it violated the constitutional protections of those who could not be constitutionally justified targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since section 250.20 of the Penal Law has been found unconstitutional as to defendant, his alleged criminal act could not be the basis of an additional charge of obstructing governmental administration, and that charge must also fall.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorneys brought a civil proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 to enjoin respondents, the town and the district attorney, from prosecution of a misdemeanor complaint filed by an individual who alleged that petitioners' erroneous issuance of a second restraining order in another proceeding was an unlawful collection practice under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 190.50.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An individual filed a misdemeanor complaint against petitioner attorneys based on their conduct in another proceeding. The complaint alleged that erroneous issuance of a second restraining order, valid on its face but later set aside by court order, constituted an unlawful collection practice under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 190.50. Petitioners filed a motion under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 to enjoin respondents, the town and the district attorney, from prosecuting the complaint. The court found that because there was no claim that respondents acted in excess of their authority, the court lacked jurisdiction under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78. Because petitioners sought alternative relief in the form of a declaratory judgment and an injunction, however, the form of petitioners' motion did not prevent resolution of the case. The court concluded that petitioners' conduct in the other proceeding did not fall within the definition of an unlawful collection practice. The restraining notice in question was an authentic document issued by petitioners in their capacity as officers of the court. Thus, respondents were permanently enjoined from proceeding with the misdemeanor complaint filed against petitioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted petitioner attorneys' request for a declaratory ruling enjoining respondents, the town and the district attorney, from prosecuting a misdemeanor complaint on the grounds that petitioners' erroneous issuance of an order did not amount to an unlawful collection practice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against body or officer -- pending criminal action -- unlawful collection practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The attorneys for a judgment creditor erroneously served the same person with a second restraining notice against the property of the judgment debtor without leave of the court, as required by CPLR 5222 (subd [c]), whereupon the judgment debtor filed a misdemeanor complaint against them, based on section 190.50 of the Penal Law, defining unlawful collection practices and making it a misdemeanor to attempt to foist off as authentic an instrument which simulates an official document but which possesses no judicial or official sanction.  In an article 78 proceeding by the attorneys to enjoin prosecution of the misdemeanor complaint, treated as an action for a declaratory judgment and an injunction, it is declared that their conduct in issuing the second restraining notice without leave of the court did not constitute an unlawful collection practice within the meaning of section 190.50 of the Penal Law, and respondents, the Town Justice and District Attorney, are permanently enjoined from proceeding with the misdemeanor complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An article 78 proceeding is not proper, since&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  there is no claim that respondents are about to act in excess of their authority, but the attorneys have sought alternate relief in the nature of a declaratory judgment and injunction, and the article 78 form of their moving papers does not preclude the court from considering these latter prayers for relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While a collateral proceeding to review alleged errors in a pending criminal action is generally prohibited, and while a criminal action has, technically, been commenced against the attorneys by the filing of the misdemeanor complaint, no further proceedings have taken place, and the attorneys, who are threatened with irreparable injury and whose application involves solely a question of law, should not be foreclosed from seeking declaratory and injunctive relief at this pre-embryonic stage of the criminal proceeding. Additionally, the far-reaching implications of needlessly subjecting officers of the court to criminal prosecution if a particular criminal enactment was never intended to encompass their routine professional activities, even if erroneously performed, dictate that the application be entertained.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurance companies filed an action for a judgement declaring unconstitutional 1976 N.Y. Laws 843, which required that every health insurance policy issued include equal coverage for maternity care.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1976 N.Y. Laws 843 required that every health insurance policy issued include coverage for maternity care to the same extent that hospital, surgical, or medical coverage was provided for illness or disease under the policy. The insurance companies filed an action for a judgment declaring the statute unconstitutional and the Superintendent of Insurance filed a motion for summary judgment. The insurance companies filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The court held that it was not persuaded that the statute would have resulted in irrational and unreasonable regulation of the insurance business and that maternity coverage was not a business utterly foreign to the insurance companies but was merely an extension of that business. The court found that the statute did not deprive the insurance companies of due process and granted summary judgment to the Superintendent on the due process issue. The court held that the statute could not modify by operation of law those policies issued as guaranteed renewable policies and granted summary judgment in favor of the insurance companies as to that issue. The court held that the issue of adequate time for implementation was one for trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- health insurance -- compulsory inclusion of maternity benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 843 of the Laws of 1976 which requires that every health insurance policy issued in this State include &quot;coverage for maternity care * * * to the same extent that hospital, surgical or medical coverage is provided for illness or disease under the policy&quot; will not unconstitutionally result in irrational and unreasonable regulation of the insurance business.  While the compulsory inclusion of maternity coverage in all health insurance policies will, to some extent, make plaintiffs' health insurance business more difficult or expensive it does not invalidate the statute.  Plaintiffs' fears of unfair, irrational and unpredictable increases in premiums are entirely speculative.  Plaintiffs have not yet prepared premium schedules nor proposed policies in order to comply with chapter 843.  Plaintiffs can mitigate the effects of &quot;anti-selection&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which would occur if couples permit their health insurance policies to lapse after obtaining the maternity benefits, by offering multiyear policies or pooling their maternity risks thereby decreasing the effects on any single insurer. Chapter 843 does not have the effect of destroying the health insurance business.  The statute does not forbid the sale of a &quot;nondeleterious&quot; product, but simply requires that the product contain an additional ingredient which the Legislature has determined to be essential for the public welfare.  Chapter 843 does not unconstitutionally compel plaintiffs to enter into a new and unwanted business.  Maternity coverage is not a &quot;business utterly foreign&quot; to plaintiffs' health insurance business, but is merely an extension of that business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Consonant with the constitutional prohibition against the impairment of the obligation of contracts, chapter 843 may not be applied to the renewal of &quot;guaranteed renewable&quot; policies which plaintiffs have no choice but to renew at the sole option of the insured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The question of whether the January 1, 1977 effective date of the statute provides a reasonable preparation period to enable timely compliance may only&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be determined by a trier of fact.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted of promotion of prostitution, moved for a dismissal on the ground that the prostitution statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 230.00, was vague and overbroad, and that such sexual activity was a basic right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of promoting prostitution. He moved for dismissal, contending that the statute defining prostitution, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 230.00, was unconstitutional in that it was vague and overbroad. He also alleged that such &quot;recreational sex&quot; could not be outlawed. The court denied the motion. The failure to define the terms &quot;sexual conduct&quot; and &quot;fee&quot; did not render &sect; 230.00&nbsp;unconstitutional because the terms were commonly understood to encompass intercourse and masturbation, performed for payment. The regulation of such conduct was within the state's police power. The court also found that such legislation of morality was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion; the statute was not vague as terms within it had commonly understood meanings, and it was not overbroad, therefore the legislature was free to address morality in legislation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 230.00 of the Penal Law, which provides that a &quot;person is guilty of prostitution when such person engages or agrees or offers to engage in sexual conduct with another person in return for a fee&quot;, is not unconstitutional.  It was enacted to prohibit commercial exploitation of sexual gratification, a legitimate legislative concern, and, while the terms &quot;sexual conduct&quot; and &quot;fee&quot; are not further defined therein, the term &quot;prostitution&quot; itself has a commonly understood meaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That there may be marginal cases where the criminality of the conduct is not clear is not sufficient to render the statute unconstitutional. However, to avoid confusion and possible future attack on the statute, if the Legislature deems that sexual acts other than those within the common understanding of the term &quot;prostitution&quot; should&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  come within the ambit of the statute, it might well define &quot;sexual conduct&quot; to include those acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees, who were non-residents of New York, were employed by a contractor who had been awarded a contract to construct sanitary systems for the County. The contractor terminated the employees' employment pursuant to &sect; 222. Section 222 provided that, in public works construction, preference in employment was to be given to citizens of New York who had been residents of the State for at least 12 consecutive months immediately prior to the commencement of their new employment. In declaring &sect; 222&nbsp;unconstitutional, the court ruled that the statute created a classification of workers that denied the employees the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Section 222 denied the employees the opportunity of obtaining and engaging in lawful employment solely because they had not resided in New York for an arbitrarily prescribed period. It not only abridged their fundamental right to travel, but also their right to engage in business, which right was the very purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court further ruled that the preference created by &sect; 222 in favor of resident workers violated the Privileges and Immunities and Commerce Clauses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended that the question was whether the court should place itself in the position of deciding whether the legislature was correct in passing a law listing cocaine as a narcotic substance and whether the court had the power to second guess the legislature. They urged that, as applied to cocaine, the law was unconstitutional substantively and that the penalties were also. The court held that a classification of cocaine within a definition of the term &quot;narcotic drug&quot; was not arbitrary or irrational. The court also held that statutes classifying cocaine within a definition of &quot;narcotic drug&quot; did not violate the equal protection and due process clauses of state and federal constitutions. The court further held that punishments imposed for the crime of possession of cocaine were not grossly disproportionate or cruel and unusual in the constitutional sense. Finally, in determining whether a penal statute imposed cruel and unusual punishment, the court required a consideration of the gravity of the offense, the harm it caused to society, the crime it generated, and the threat the offender posed to society.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a statute that failed to distinguish between innocent conduct and action calculated to cause harm could not be sustained. The court also held that the provision of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act that no alcoholic beverage could be stored or kept on any premises which were not duly licensed as provided for in the chapter entitled &quot;Special Permits&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. Specifically, the statute did not give reasonable and sufficient notice of what was prohibited in that a permit would be required to store or keep alcoholic beverages in the home, regardless of amount or intent of the homeowner and control of private residences not involved in a sale.

Under its wording a private citizen would be required to obtain a permit to keep alcoholic beverages in his residence even though his residence was not utilized for any activity covered by the law.  Moreover, it does not direct itself to a prohibited amount or to the intent or object of the one storing the beverages, nor does it restrict its application to certain types of premises, but covers all premises in the State where alcoholic beverages may be found, regardless of amount and regardless of the intent and object of the one storing them.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff seaplane operator filed an action against defendant state agencies and officers (state), and alleged that the state permitted unlawful uses of forest lands, that the plan for the Adirondack Park area was unconstitutional, and that the prohibition of seaplane landings in certain lakes was unconstitutional. An environmental group received permission to intervene. The state and the operator filed motions for partial summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state had set aside certain forest preserves, and mandated in N.Y. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 1, that those preserves remain wild forests. The parties agreed that the question of unlawful use of some of the forest lands was not amenable to summary judgment. The court held that although N.Y. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 1 deprived the legislature of any power to permit commercial cutting of timber in the state forests, the legislature was permitted to make reasonable regulations for the public use and preservation of the forests. The court held that because the legislature had the authority to make reasonable regulations, it had the power to delegate that authority to agencies such as the Adirondack Park Agency. The court held that the Adirondack Master Plan, which divided the forest preserve areas into seven categories did not violate art. XIV, &sect; 1's mandate that the forest preserves remain wild forest. The court held that N.Y. Comp. Codes R &amp; Regs. tit 6, &sect; 196.4, which prohibited the use of seaplanes on certain of the lakes within the forest reserves, served the bona fide purpose of preserving the natural character of the land and was not arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted summary judgment in favor of the state on the constitutionality of the Adirondack Master Plan and the regulations prohibiting seaplanes from landing in certain lakes within the forest preserves.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Environmental conservation -- State land in Adirondack Park -- State Land Master Plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The State Land Master Plan, which was developed by the Adirondack Park Agency in consultation with the Department of Environmental Conservation, pursuant to a directive contained in the Adirondack Park Agency Act (Executive Law, art 27, &sect; 807), and which was approved by the Governor and thereafter by the Legislature (L 1973, ch 348), classifies the State land within the park into seven land use categories.  This provision for different uses in different areas of the forest preserve, some of which uses entail the cutting of timber, does not violate the &quot;forever wild&quot; clause of the New York State Constitution, providing that the &quot;lands of the state * * * constituting the forest preserve * * * shall be forever kept as wild forest lands * * * nor shall the timber thereon be sold, removed or destroyed&quot; (NY Const, art XIV, &sect; 1).  Accordingly, in a suit instituted by the operators of an air taxi service, with the consent of the Appellate Division (NY Const, art XIV, &sect; 5), a cause of action alleging that the plan is unconstitutional because of the classifications made therein, and because&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it was not adopted as a constitutional amendment, is summarily dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Another cause of action alleges that some of the uses permitted in the forest preserve actually destroy its wild forest nature because they entail cutting significant amounts of timber and overuse of the area where they are permitted.  The language of the plan itself recognizes that some of the uses which it authorizes may be declared unconstitutional.  However, unlike a determination as to the constitutionality of the plan itself, a determination as to the constitutionality of any given uses authorized by it can be made only after a trial, since there are questions of fact regarding the reasonableness of the uses, especially in light of the amount of timber which had to be cut in order to establish them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  A third cause of action challenges the validity of a regulation of the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation which prohibits the operation of mechanically propelled vessels and aircraft on some 700 lakes and ponds which are wholly surrounded by State land within the park (6 NYCRR 196.4).  In view of the discontinuance, with prejudice, of a prior article 78 proceeding challenging this regulation, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the nature of this action, to restrain an alleged violation of the &quot;forever wild&quot; clause, the only question to be determined is whether that clause prohibits the making of such a regulation. While the clause would prohibit a regulation which arbitrarily restricts public access to or a reasonable public use of the lands in the preserve, this regulation does not do so.  Accordingly, the third cause of action is summarily dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Buffalo, N.Y., Ordinance ch. VII, &sect; 352, according to the court, was a reasoned, well-intended effort to eliminate the unscrupulous real estate activities and substantial community damage that was associated with racial &quot;blockbusting&quot; and &quot;panic selling&quot; of residential property by white residents. The city contended that the signs constituted unnecessarily visible evidence of neighborhood change and served to create unfounded, unreasonable fears of diminished property values and neighborhood deterioration. In granting plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, the court ruled that the ordinance violated U.S. Const. amend. I and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court found that the subject was appropriate for municipal legislation, but that an attempted solution could not be accomplished by unconstitutional or illegal means. The United States Supreme Court had declared that commercial speech was not wholly outside the protection of the First Amendment. Municipalities were without power or authority to accomplish what they perceived to be the peoples' best interests by denying them information that was neither false nor misleading.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although an ordinance of the City of Buffalo prohibiting the display of &quot;for sale&quot; signs on certain types of residential property constitutes a reasoned and well-intended effort to eliminate racial &quot;blockbusting&quot; and &quot;panic selling&quot; of residential property, the ordinance unconstitutionally restrains the right of free speech. While some commercial speech is subject to regulation, the free flow of truthful commercial information may not be impaired, whether or not the persons receiving the information may act thereon in a manner inconsistent with their own self-interest or the public interest. </SPAN></P>

No such progress would have been possible had even a small proportion of the 12,639 claimants elected to ignore the remedy adopted for their benefit and proceeded, instead by separate actions and concomitant motions for summary judgment. The ensuing delay would penalize all claimants and benefit none, including plaintiff.  </SPAN></P>

Law &sect; 210.20(1)(h), defendants filed motions to dismiss their indictments in the New York trial court for felony drug charges. Defendants alleged that actions of law enforcement officials of the New York State Drug Enforcement Task Force constituted discriminatory prosecutions and violated their rights under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the United States and New York Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested by federal agents as a result of drug investigations conducted by the state Task Force. Defendants were told that if they co-operated they would be prosecuted federally; but if they failed to co-operate they would be prosecuted in the state courts, with the consequent harsher penalties. Defendants refused to co-operate and were indicted for felony drug charges in New York. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the indictments on the grounds of selective or discriminatory prosecution in violation of their equal protection and due process rights. The court held that the procedures used to determine whether to prosecute in federal or state court were constitutionally valid. However, the court granted the motions to dismiss and ordered a hearing be held determine the validity of the allegations. Defendant's claimed they were singled out for prosecution under a specific statute in a specific jurisdiction, in order to expose them to harsher penalties, solely because they refused to co-operate and turn informers. This discouraged the assertion of their rights against self-incrimination or violated their rights of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants, who were arrested by special agents of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration as the result of investigations conducted by the New York Drug Enforcement Task Force (Task Force), a Federally funded tripartite organization consisting of Federal, State and local law enforcement representation, may not be prosecuted in the New York State courts in order to expose them to harsher or higher penalties upon drug convictions solely because they refused to co-operate and turn informers. Normally, the criteria followed by the Task Force in channeling cases to the State or Federal courts for prosecution involve such reasonable factors as the availability of a harsher sentence structure under State law, the amount of narcotics involved, with lesser cases going to State courts, the need for search warrants which are easier to obtain in State courts, the extent of conspiracy which is easier to prove in Federal courts, the easier corroboration requirements in Federal courts and the greater opportunity for trials in Federal courts as opposed to plea bargaining. Although defendants do not have a constitutional right&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be prosecuted under a Federal rather than a State law where their acts violate both even where they are prosecuted under the statute which imposes the higher penalty, they may not be singled out for prosecution under the harsher statute solely because they invoked their constitutional rights against self incrimination.  Whatever appropriate or commendable purposes the prosecutors may have had in setting up a system to determine which offenders are prosecuted in what jurisdiction, they cannot pursue their objective by any means that needlessly chill the exercise of basic constitutional rights. Accordingly, defendants' motion to dismiss the indictments are granted to the extent that a hearing is ordered to determine the validity of their claims of selective or discriminatory prosecution.  Once defendants present sufficient facts to raise a reasonable doubt about the prosecution's purpose, the prosecution would then be required to go forward to justify in some rational basis their actions in selecting defendants for prosecution in the New York State courts.  </SPAN></P>

The court rejected the spouse's argument that there was an unjust distinction as to the effect of a reconciliation subsequent to a separation decree as opposed to a separation agreement. Although evidence of a reconciliation was adequate to overcome a separation agreement, a separation decree could only be revoked under N.Y. Dom. Rel.

She then left him and commenced an action for a separation, but her complaint was dismissed because of the existing decree. They thereafter remained apart until his death some 14 years later.  Her claim to an elective share of his estate is denied.

Subdivision 2 of section 220.25 of the Penal Law, providing that the &quot;presence of a narcotic drug, narcotic preparation or marihuana in open view in a room, other than a public room, under circumstances evincing an intent to unlawfully mix, compound, package or otherwise prepare for sale such controlled substance is presumptive evidence of knowing possession thereof by each and every person in close proximity to such controlled substance at the time such controlled substance was found&quot;, is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. To be &quot;in close proximity&quot; to a controlled substance so as to be within the ambit of the statutory presumption, one need not be in the same room or in an alcove off the same room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Two defendants, convicted by a jury of criminal possession of heroin, had been found in an apartment, approximately 12 feet from a kitchen where others were conspicuously engaged in preparing the heroin for sale.  One of them, then 21 years of age, was the only member of the family who regularly occupied&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the apartment on the premises at the time, and it is unlikely that the activity in the kitchen was without his knowledge, approval and participation.  A motion by him to set aside the jury verdict is denied.  However, the other defendant had recently taken up residence in the apartment, was only 16 years of age, was not a member of the family, and would presumedly have little to say about what went on there while the 21-year-old codefendant was present.  These circumstances, coupled with her distance from the contraband, strongly tend to rebut the statutory presumption, and compel the conclusion that a reasonable doubt has been raised as a matter of law. A motion by her to set aside the jury verdict is granted.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted an ordinance, Buffalo, N.Y., Local Laws 5 (1976), which imposed an excise tax on occupancy. The citizens filed an action against the mayor of the city that sought a declaration that the tax was unconstitutional and sought an injunction against the collection of the tax or imposition of penalties for nonpayment of the tax. The mayor filed a motion for dismissal of the citizens' action, which the court treated as a motion for summary judgment and directed judgment for the mayor. The occupancy tax was not unconstitutionally vague. The ordinance set forth with clarity the obligations and liabilities of persons defined therein. The tax did not violate the citizens' due process rights. Public interest required the legislation. The means to collect the tax were reasonable and there was no interference with property rights. The tax required the application of fundamental due process in the use of the courts prior to the imposition of a lien. The ordinance was for the sole purpose the raising of revenue; therefore the citizens could not avail themselves of the due process clause to condemn it. Neither were equal protection guarantees violated by the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. A court's inquiry is limited to whether a tax enactment is in compliance with the requirements of the State and Federal Constitutions.  Whether an occupancy tax is the best means of raising needed revenue or whether a Legislature should have enacted a different taxing method are without the scope of the court's inquiry.  Personal feelings as to the nature of the tax questioned and sympathy for those whose means make it difficult to comply with a particular law are irrelevant and cannot be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Presumption of Constitutionality of Ordinances -- Burden of Proof</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. Ordinances, as well as statutes, are presumed to be constitutional and those who seek to hold them otherwise must sustain a great burden of proof and this burden goes beyond a reasonable doubt.  This is especially true when the law questioned involves the taxing power since the Legislatures possess their greatest freedom in this area.  </SPAN></P>

Petitioner closed title on the premises within the dune district only after obtaining a building permit from the town building department. The building department revoked the building permit after petitioner commenced construction of the dwelling on the ground that the permit had been issued without the town board approval required for such construction in the oceanfront dune district under the town code.

New York City, N.Y., Admin Code &sect; 488(2-1.0) commanded fire marshals to investigate, examine, and inquire into the origins of suspicious fires.

Defendant's apartment was destroyed by the fire.  All the windows and the door to defendant's apartment were destroyed. The unhabitability of the apartment became tantamount to actual abandonment. The search of the burned-out apartment by the fire marshals, who have the statutory duty to investigate, examine and inquire into the origin, detail and management of fires in the city, particularly of supposed cases of arson, incendiarism, or fires due to criminal recklessness (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 488 [2]-1.0), was therefor not interdicted by the Fourth Amendment since a reasonable expectancy of privacy no longer existed.  A prompt&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  inspection by a fire marshal to ascertain the cause of a fire does not require a warrant.  It is logical to presume that evidence of the cause of a serious fire might still be found on the premises or what was left of it after the fire was extinguished.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor vehicles -- driving while intoxicated -- driving while impaired -- absence of chemical blood test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Under section 1196 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, which makes driving while impaired a lesser included offense of driving while intoxicated (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 1192, subds 1, 3), a defendant charged with driving while intoxicated cannot be convicted of driving while his ability was impaired by alcohol in the absence of chemical alcohol blood tests.  &quot;Intoxication&quot; is defined as such a condition as impairs to some extent the ability of a person to operate an automobile.  Under such definition there is no distinction between intoxication and impairment. If the driver's ability to operate is impaired by alcohol, he is intoxicated. To determine whether there is an impairment, observational testimony is necessary at a trial.  The Vehicle and Traffic Law no longer delineates a minimum blood alcohol level which would constitute prima facie or relevant evidence of intoxication. The statute does however provide that a blood alcohol level of .08% or .09% is prima facie evidence that the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  driver was operating the motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 1195).  Section 1196 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law would be unconstitutionally vague if it were interpreted to mean that a defendant charged with driving while intoxicated could be convicted of the lesser included offense of driving while impaired in the absence of chemical blood test results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 1193-a of the Vehicle and Traffic Law which requires a motorist to submit to a breath screening test if the vehicle he operated was involved in an accident, under penalty of a traffic infraction for refusal, is not unconstitutional on its face.  The mere happening of an accident does not of itself give rise to &quot;probable cause&quot;, or even suspicion of commission of the crime of driving while intoxicated. However, while investigating an accident, the police officer may obtain &quot;probable cause&quot; or &quot;necessary suspicion&quot; sufficient to justify a demand for a breath screening test.  Under such circumstances, the compulsory submitting to the breath test would not constitute a violation of the motorist's constitutional rights.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dispute arose between the taxpayer and the comptroller as to whether certain bond anticipation notes were issued in accordance with law. The taxpayer sought a declaration that the notes were unconstitutionally issued, and he sought to enjoin the further issuance of the notes to reimburse the state's general fund for capital expenditures incurred in prior years instead of for a specified work or purpose. The comptroller filed motions to dismiss, and for a change in venue. The court granted the comptroller's motion to dismiss, concluding that the taxpayer lacked standing to bring the action pursuant to N.Y. State Fin. Law &sect; 123-b (1). That statute granted standing to taxpayers to maintain equitable or declaratory relief actions against state officers for misappropriation of funds, except in cases of the authorization, sale, execution, or delivery of a bond issue, or notes issued in anticipation of a bond. Thus, the taxpayer lacked standing to maintain his action against the comptroller, and standing was not expanded under decisional law.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff lacks standing to challenge the legality of bond anticipation notes issued by the State since the statute which authorizes the maintenance of taxpayers' suits against State officials to enjoin the wrongful expenditure, misappropriation or any other illegal or unconstitutional disbursement of State funds or property, does &quot;not apply to the authorization, sale, execution or delivery of a bond issue or notes issued in anticipation thereof by the state or any agency&quot; (State Finance Law, &sect; 123-b, subd 1).  The statute establishes an orderly procedure defining and delineating taxpayers' rights with regard to maintaining suits relating to State fiscal matters and is clearly intended to restrict the grant of standing so that it shall not apply to bond anticipation notes. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered the request of petitioner, a social service agency, that the court authorize the adoption of a boy by his foster parents over the objection of respondent biological mother. The social service agency argued that under the permanent neglect statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act art. 6, the possessory claim of the mother should be terminated because of a failure to maintain substantial and continuous contact with the boy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 16-year-old boy had been placed in his foster home when he was less than a year old. With the help of his foster family, he developed into a well-educated, well-motivated, well-balanced youth who completely identified with his foster parents and his siblings as his family. The boy was strongly opposed to any contact or connection with his biological family and desired adoption by the foster parents. The social service agency brought an action under the Act for the purpose of enabling the boy's foster parents to adopt him. The biological mother claimed that she could prevent the adoption and the termination of her right to call herself the boy's parent. The court entered an order authorizing the boy's adoption by his foster parents, holding that the mother's claim could not lawfully or constitutionally frustrate the boy's best interests. The boy's compelling and overwhelming constitutional right to freedom from the mother's possessory claim overcame her claim. The court had ancillary inherent jurisdiction under the Act to afford the boy an appropriate remedy that promoted the general purpose of the Act in this extraordinary circumstance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the social service agency's petition that the boy be permitted to be adopted by his foster family over the possessory claims of the mother, and it entered an order authorizing the adoption.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The 16-year-old son of respondent natural mother has the right to the termination of respondent's possessory claim to him for the purpose of his adoption by his foster parents since such adoption is unequivocally in his best interest. Respondent's son has a constitutional right to freedom from respondent's parental possessory claim. Respondent's possessory claim cannot lawfully or constitutionally frustrate her son's best interests.  He has been living with his foster parents for 15 years.  He has developed with his foster family into a well-educated, well-motivated, well-balanced youth.  He regards his foster parents as his permanent parents and their biological children as his older siblings.  He is strongly opposed to any contact or connection with his biological family and fervently desires adoption by his foster parents.  The child's best interests are not served by respondent's continued title to him.  To refuse to consider the child's best interest because of a biological parent's title to him would be unconstitutional.  Before a court can consider whether a child's best interests&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  will be served by a nonparent's custody, a specified misfeasance or nonfeasance by the biological parent or &quot;like extraordinary circumstances&quot; must be shown.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The shop owner was the sole proprietor of a shop that displayed sexually explicit materials and was visited by adults as well as youth. The shop owner was arrested and charged with violating the ordinance for displaying materials to youth that were deemed devoted to or principally made up of descriptions or depictions of illicit sex or sexual immorality or that consisted of pictures of nude or partially denuded figures. The charge was later dismissed but the shop owner sought declaratory and injunctive relief to test the validity of the ordinance based on its chilling effect and the threat of future prosecution. The court enjoined the enforcement of the ordinance because its ban on the display of sexually oriented material that might not be obscene was both overbroad and unconstitutional. Further, the ordinance was held unconstitutionally vague in that citizens could not know what exactly what it proscribed, which could lead to the discriminatory enforcement of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a motion to reargue defendant's motion for dismissal of his criminal indictment. Defendant argued that the grand jury which returned his indictment was illegally constituted when the grand jury was chosen from a panel that exempted women from service and thus violated his right to be indicted by an impartial grand jury that was drawn from a fair cross section of the community.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the State's motion to reargue. Defendant asserted that the United States Supreme Court held that a Louisiana conviction could not stand when the jury panels were established under a statutory scheme that required a woman to volunteer for jury service before she was eligible to be summoned. He asserted that he stood in the same position as defendants charged and tried under the unconstitutional Louisiana law. The court reasoned that the former New York law, N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 599(7), which granted women an automatic right to an exemption once summoned, differed from the Louisiana law. The standard for measuring the claim of an illegally constituted panel was whether defendant submitted sufficient proof to establish the intentional and systematic discrimination in the jury selection process. Defendant did not present proof of any intentional exclusion of a group. Women were allowed to volunteer and the fact that one group predominated or was lacking in the grand jury did not justify a declaration that the grand jury was illegally constituted. The court denied defendant's motion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that the 1975 Queens County Grand Jury which indicted defendant was chosen at a time when women were granted an automatic exemption from jury service (Judiciary Law, former &sect; 599, subd 7) does not mandate dismissal of the indictment under the holding of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Taylor v Louisiana</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (419 U.S. 522) which condemns the deliberate exclusion of a particular community group or class of persons from jury service. Defendant has failed to submit proof sufficient to establish intentional and systematic discrimination in the jury selection process. Everyone, including women, may volunteer for jury service and the fact that certain groups may predominate or be lacking in Grand Juries does not justify a declaration that such a Grand Jury is illegally constituted.  The list of grand jurors which made up the 1975 pool was selected from a constitutionally acceptable pool of petit jurors and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from outside volunteers who were qualified to serve upon a petit jury. Since the statutes for the selection of grand jurors were applied equally to all persons who were qualified to serve regardless of group or class, they are constitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff noteholder filed a motion for class action status in its action against defendant city pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a dispute arose between the noteholders, the city, the municipal assistance corporation regarding the applicable interest rate, the noteholder filed one action against the municipal assistance corporation and the other noteholder filed an action against the city. After the noteholder acquired a judgment against the municipal assistance corporation, the other noteholder sought to consolidate that action with the claim against the city and also to be awarded class status. The court denied the motions, but the denial was without prejudice to intervene in order to challenge the determination of the interest rate. Class action status was not appropriate because there was no demonstration of a representative party that would fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class or that a class action was superior to other available methods to adjudicate the controversy as required by N.Y. C.P.L.R. 901(a). Further, because the noteholder sought a declaration of unconstitutionality, there was no need for class status because any relief would inure to the benefit of all. Consolidation was not appropriate because one case had barely begun and the other had proceeded to judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motions without prejudice to a motion to intervene for the sole purpose of appealing the determination of interest rate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- New York State Emergency Moratorium Act for City of New York -- consolidation of actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Movant, the holder of certain matured and unpaid short-term obligations issued by the City of New York, may not maintain as a class action its action to have the New York State Emergency Moratorium Act for the City of New York (L 1975, ch 874, as amd by ch 875) declared unconstitutional as denying &quot;just compensation&quot; under the Federal and State Constitutions since there is no showing that the proposed &quot;class action is superior&quot; to other available methods of procedure ( CPLR 901, subd a, par 5).  There is no need for class action status since the prior decision of the Court of Appeals declaring the Moratorium Act unconstitutional as violative of the faith and credit provisions of the State Constitution (see 40 NY2d 731) will inure to the benefit of all noteholders. The Court of Appeals by its remittitur (40 NY2d 1093) fashioned a remedy benefiting all noteholders. In compliance with the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  remittitur simple and expeditious procedures were established whereby noteholders who have not consented to an extension could recover judgments for the amounts of their notes with interest after maturity at 6% (see 88 Misc 2d 1047). Such procedures are far simpler and more expeditious than any relief obtainable by movant in an independent class action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Movant's action may not be consolidated with the action which has proceeded to judgment in the Court of Appeals.  The Court of Appeals remittitur affords movant, and all the other members of the proposed class, a swift, inexpensive and efficacious remedy.  No proceeding pursuant to consolidation could obtain so desirable a result so promptly. The only issue left open between the noteholders and the city was that of the interest rate which has been fixed at 6% by Special Term.  All of movant's rights can be protected and advanced by permitting it to move to intervene for the sole purpose of taking an appeal from the determination of the interest rate. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant accepted a one-third kickback on orders for nursing home supplies, he was indicted with violations of N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 414.16 (c)(3), 730.3(c)(3). Defendant filed a motion that asserted the regulations were unconstitutionally vague and he also sought dismissal of some of the counts on the grounds that the regulations were not properly published. The court denied the motions, holding that defendant's constitutional rights were not violated because the First Amendment did not apply. Further, vagueness challenges to statutes that did not invoke the First Amendment had to be examined in the light of the facts of the individual case. The court reasoned that a man of ordinary intelligence would realize that accepting kickbacks was not conduct within normal business practices. Accordingly, defendant could not avail himself of a claim of vagueness because his own conduct struck at the heart of the prohibition in the regulations. Further, the failure to publish the regulations did not violate N.Y. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8 because that constitutional provision did not mandate immediate publication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The regulations under which defendant is indicted which prohibit any &quot;operator or agent, consultant or representative&quot; of a nursing home from accepting &quot;any remuneration, rebate, gift benefit or advantage of any form from any vendor or other supplier because of the purchase, rental or loan of equipment, supplies or services for the nursing home or patient excluding normal business practices&quot; (10 NYCRR 730.3 [c] [3], 414.16 [c] [3]) is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's conduct of allegedly accepting a one-third kickback on orders.  Defendant and a coconspirator allegedly caused a vendor to submit bills for goods never delivered to the nursing home and then allegedly caused the vendor to return to them in cash the amount of the undelivered supplies which amounted to one third of the total order.  The coconspirators allegedly changed and falsified their own records by listing nondelivered goods as if they were delivered.  A law which does not proscribe First Amendment rights may only be void for vagueness if it is vague as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  applied to precise circumstances of the individual case. While marginal cases may exist where doubt about the meaning of the phrase &quot;except normal business practices&quot; would make application of the statute unconstitutional for vagueness, defendant may not avail himself of such instance where his own conduct strikes at the heart of the statute's prohibition.  A man of ordinary intelligence would realize that such conduct is not within normal business practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The fact the properly filed regulation under which defendant was indicted was unpublished does not invalidate the indictment since a regulation becomes effective when filed with the Secretary of State and not when it is published (NY Const, art IV, &sect; 8).  The purpose of the filing requirement is to provide a central location where all rules and regulations may be examined by those who may be affected by them.  The Constitution does not mandate immediate publication.  In any event, defendant had actual notice of the regulation since a copy was mailed to his place of business. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners claimed that the city council exceeded its power in enacting New York City, N.Y., Local Law No. 45 and that it was unconstitutional because it did not apply to all defaulting owners equally; and that New York City, N.Y., Local Laws Nos. 46-47 were punitive, confiscatory, and in effect constituted an additional tax, and thus were beyond the power of the city to enact. The court declared New York City, N.Y., Local Law Nos. 45-47 constitutional and denied the preliminary injunction against the city that was requested by the property owners, holding that the legislature had authorized the city to pass such laws regarding taxation and that the city under Nos. 45-47 had the authority to foreclose a tax lien and to increase the interest rate for unpaid real estate taxes and unpaid water and sewer rents. The court further held that there was nothing in the New York Municipal Home Rule Law that prohibited the city from enacting a local law related to the collection of local taxes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal corporations - in rem foreclosure action - adoption of local laws relating to collection of local taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The City Council of the City of New York had the power to enact Local Law No. 45 of the Local Laws of the City of New York of 1976 (amdg Administrative Code of City of New York, ch 17, tit D, &sect; D17-4.0) which reduced from three years to one year the period after which an in rem action for foreclosure of a tax lien could be commenced.  Section 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law expressly gives cities the authority to adopt local laws relating to the collection and administration of taxes not inconsistent with any general State law. Previously, in rem foreclosure provisions had been added to the Administrative Code by special laws enacted by the Legislature. There is nothing in the Municipal Home Rule Law prohibiting the city from enacting a local law relating to the collection of local taxes which is inconsistent with a special law. Plaintiffs have not shown that Local Law No. 45 is inconsistent with any general law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Local Law No. 45 does not violate the equal protection clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions because owner-occupied one- and two-family homes with real estate taxes of not more than $ 2,000 per year are exempted from its provisions. The shorter one-year period was motivated in part to discourage owners from &quot;milking&quot; their property. Such problem is not presented with owner-occupied one- and two-family buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Local Laws Nos. 46 and 47 of 1976 which increased the interest on unpaid real estate taxes and unpaid water and sewer rents to 15%, are not arbitrary, confiscatory illegal additional taxes. The City Council felt that many landlords were financing themselves on the city's back by a rate which was less than the prevailing second mortgage rate.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was employed as a school district's attorney. The position was part-time and excluded litigation and other matters. Legal services for excluded matters were arranged for a retainer, and compensation was not a salary but a legal fee. The school district was a participating employer in the Retirement System, but the attorney's retirement allowance was based solely on his annual salary and did not include his fees for the excluded matters. The attorney retired and began receiving a retirement allowance. Later, the district had a vacancy for a school district attorney. The attorney was hired and worked for one year. During his tenure, he also rendered legal services on a fee basis. The Comptroller suspended the attorney's retirement allowance and reduced his pension reserves, finding that the attorney had rendered consulting services subject to the limitation of N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 211(4). The court reversed, holding that the limitation in &sect; 211 was created by an amendment made after the attorney retired. Thus, it did not apply to him.

Respondent State Comptroller improperly suspended petitioner's retirement allowance and reduced his pension reserves on the ground that the $ 18,550 in earnings received by petitioner in public service during 1975 consisting of $ 5,076 in salary as school district attorney, $ 11,474 as fees for legal services rendered to the school district as an independent contractor, and $ 2,000 as a retainer, exceeded his allowable earnings for 1975.

C.P.L.R. 3211 to dismiss plaintiff injured person's complaint under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, because there was another action pending between the same parties for the same relief, and for failure to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured person alleged that while he was stopped by defendant officer, the officer pushed him into a patrol car that was driven at a high rate of speed and then manhandled plaintiff prior to a court appearance. Plaintiff commenced suit against defendant under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The state attorney general assumed defendant's defense under N.Y. Pub. Off Law &sect; 17(2) and moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211. Defendant claimed that the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the claim, that another action was pending for the same relief, and that the complaint failed to state a cause of action. The court agreed to dismiss. The court held that while New York courts had concurrent jurisdiction with federal courts over 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims, the injuries sustained by plaintiff -- those from a mere assault -- were not sufficient to establish a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim. The court held that defendant could simultaneously pursue a federal and state civil rights claim. Finally, the court held that U.S. Const. amend.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State Supreme Court has concurrent jurisdiction with Federal courts over civil actions alleging a deprivation of civil rights under color of State law under section 1983 of title 42 of the United States Code.  Section 1983 was intended to afford aggrieved persons access to Federal tribunals. The statute was designed to provide a remedy where State law was inadequate, or adequate in theory but not in practice, and constitutes a Federal remedy supplementary to State remedies.  Although section 1983 is Federal in origin, grants a remedy unknown at common law and is governed by Federal substantive principles, unless and until the United States Supreme Court determines otherwise, there is no legal barrier to presentation of section 1983 claims in State Supreme Court (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Aldinger v Howard</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, US, 96 S Ct 2413). Federal District Courts are only granted &quot;original&quot; and not &quot;exclusive&quot; jurisdiction over civil actions arising under section 1983 (US Code, tit 28, &sect; 1343, subd [3]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff, who was allegedly &quot;assaulted, physically affronted, searched and maniculed&quot; but not physically&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  injured, while being arrested for traffic violations by defendant, a State trooper, does not have a Federal civil rights cause of action since only the use of excessive and unnecessary force during the course of an arrest leading to severe personal injury or death are within the ambit of section 1983 civil rights claims.  While police officers may be civilly liable for unconstitutional acts, not every tort committed against a private person by an official under State law rises to the deprivation of a constitutional right.  Grievances easily remedied under traditional State law concepts should not be the subject of national concern.  Absent severe personal injury, simple assaults are not within the ambit of section 1983, and the insertion of language in the complaint to give the &quot;appearance of a suit under the civil rights acts&quot; will not defeat a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiff's claim would be barred if the State would ultimately be required to pay the judgment against defendant under subdivision 1 of section 17 of the Public Officers Law which requires the State to indemnify State employees from financial loss for alleged negligent acts taken in the ordinary course of employment, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  since, under the Eleventh Amendment to the Federal Constitution, section 1983 monetary claims are not sustainable against State public officials where the award will be paid out of the State treasury.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff noteholder challenged the validity of &sect; 5(B) of the New York State Emergency Moratorium Act, which limited the interest it received on a note issued by defendant city. Defendants, an emergency financial control board and a municipal assistance corporation, also appeared. Previously, the case was heard by an appellate court, and it declared the Act unconstitutional and remitted the matter to the court to determine an interest rate issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a fiscal crisis, the Act suspended interest payments on the city's short-term obligations for three years. Section 5(B) of the Act required that interest on the city's notes be paid at the face rate fixed in each obligation until maturity, and thereafter at not less than six percent until the principal was paid or otherwise discharged. The notes in question all provided for the payment of an interest rate substantially in excess of six percent. The court held that even though the Act was found to be unconstitutional, &sect; 5(B) was to be enforced, and the noteholder was only entitled to six percent interest on payments made on the notes after they matured. The court ruled that the finding that an act was unconstitutional did not automatically require that such act be deemed to be void ab initio.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The determination of the Court of Appeals (40 NY2d 731) that the three-year moratorium on actions to enforce the short-term obligations of the City of New York imposed by the New York State Emergency Moratorium Act for the City of New York (L 1975, ch 874, as amd by ch 875) unconstitutionally denied &quot;faith and credit&quot; to the short-term anticipation notes of the city (NY Const, art VIII, &sect; 2) cannot be applied retroactively to invalidate the provisions of the Emergency Moratorium Act (&sect; 5, subd [B]) requiring that interest be paid at the face rate fixed in each obligation until maturity and thereafter at a rate not less than 6% per annum until the principal is paid or otherwise discharged. The notes held by plaintiff all provided for payment of interest at rates substantially in excess of the 6% rate.  The remittitur from the Court of Appeals (40 NY2d 1094) directing the Supreme Court to hear and determine whether the 6% rate shall be paid from the date of maturity to the date of payment &quot;as provided&quot; in the act cannot be read&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as necessarily applying the declaration of unconstitutionality to the interest rate provision by implication.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his motion to dismiss the indictment, defendant claimed that he was denied his right to a speedy trial and he also challenged the array of prospective jurors, and the composition of the grand jury. The court held that defendant's challenge to the composition of the grand jury was untimely. However, the court granted the motion to dismiss the indictment, holding that defendant was entitled to the same relief that was granted to a defendant in a companion case. The court allowed defendant's challenge to the array of prospective jurors, finding that the underrepresentation of women in the venire and in the master pool was the result of systematic and purposeful discrimination against women. The court also sustained the challenge to the array upon the added ground that persons under the age of 30 had been improperly excluded from the pool and a venire representing a cross section of the community could not have been obtained by use of the existing pool of qualified jurors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- challenge to array of prospective jurors -- purposeful underrepresentation of women in master pool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant's challenge to the array of prospective jurors summoned for jury service in Richmond County on February 7, 1977, the date fixed for the trial of the indictment, is allowed since the master pool and the venire, by reason of the continued purposeful underrepresentation of women, does not adequately reflect a cross section of the population suitable in character and intelligence for jury service. The underrepresentation of women in the venire and in the master pool is the result of systematic and purposeful discrimination against women rendering such jury selection system invalid (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Taylor v Louisiana</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 419 U.S. 522). The nonrepresentative nature of the current pool and the February 7 venire is due to the continued reliance upon a qualified juror pool built up at a time when women were permitted to claim an automatic exemption from jury service. Richmond County, which has not fully reconstituted its jury pool since 1940, cannot freeze its present jury system into a mold created by a statute, which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was repealed two years ago.  Random drawings from the pool continue to improperly produce venires in which men are overrepresented by about five times their proportional strength in the community.  Richmond County may not retain and maintain a dramatically unbalanced pool by doing nothing to correct the accumulated sexual disparity in the composition of the pool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In addition, persons under 30 years of age have been improperly excluded from the master jury pool so that a venire representing a cross section of the community cannot be obtained by use of the existing pool of qualified jurors. The disparity between the number of jurors under 30 and their representation in the community is the direct result of the procedures used by the county to obtain its jury pool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In view of the substantial economic loss sustained by defendant directly flowing from the indictment filed in April, 1974, and the delays encountered which were not of his making, the indictment is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, a 16-year-old mandatory youthful offender who was charged with aiding and abetting a 14-year-old female runaway to remain away from her home for two nights, by suggesting a place for the &quot;victim&quot; to stay in her quest to run away, cannot be found guilty of the crime of unlawful imprisonment in the second degree in violation of section 135.05 of the Penal Law, which provides that &quot;A person is guilty of unlawful imprisonment in the second degree when he restrains another person.&quot; It is uncertain whether the Legislature, in defining &quot;restrain&quot; in section 135.00 of the Penal Law, really intended the &quot;acquiescence of the victim&quot; to constitute a means of movement or confinement &quot;without consent&quot; so as to give the impression that no physical overt act is required for conviction under section 135.05 where a child under age 16 is concerned.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A nursing home operator brought a N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 action to annul a determination by the Commissioner of the Department of Health of the State of New York to revoke the operator's license to operate a nursing home because of the operator's criminal convictions. The court held that there was no reason why a criminal act must be related to the operation of a nursing home in order to justify revocation. The court reasoned that conviction of a crime without doubt bore upon character, competence, and standing in the community. The public interest in the operation of nursing homes justified the adoption of a rule that nursing home operators be free from a criminal record. The operator had admitted unlawful conduct involving a member of the legislature in connection with the promotion of the application for establishment of the nursing home. The court concluded that neither N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2801-a(10)(a) nor the Commissioner's determination was arbitrary, capricious, or affected by error of law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. As a result of criminal violations to which petitioner pleaded guilty, including the crime of unlawful fees and payments and the crimes of conspiracy and filing of false statements on Federal income tax returns, petitioner's approval of establishment to operate a certain nursing home was revoked by respondent Public Health Council, acting pursuant to the general statutory authority of section 2801-a (subd 10, par [a]) of the Public Health Law, which directs the council to adopt rules and regulations to provide for the revocation, limitation or annulment of approvals of establishment. 10 NYCRR 600.5 (e), adopted pursuant thereto, allows revocation of approval upon a finding that the established operator has been convicted in a court of competent jurisdiction of a crime.  Section 2801-a (subd 10, par [a]) of the Public Health Law is not invalid as an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. There is a clearly defined legislative policy that the character, competence and standing in the community of nursing home operators shall be subjects for consideration by the Public Health&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Nor is 19 NYCRR 600.5 (e) invalid in that it may proscribe conduct unrelated to the operation of a nursing home. There is no reason why a criminal act need be related to the operation of a nursing home in order to justify revocation, since conviction of a crime reflects upon fitness to operate a nursing home. Moreover, by petitioner's plea of guilty to the crime of unlawful fees and payments to a public officer, he has admitted unlawful conduct in connection with the promotion of the application for establishment of the very nursing home in question.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant ex-husband contested plaintiff ex-wife's annulment action and filed a motion for temporary alimony and a counsel fee while their action was pending.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ex-husband, a citizen of Israel, could not contest ex-wife's annulment action effectively from outside the country and was required to remain in the United States without means of support. Ex-husband filed a motion for temporary alimony and counsel fees while the annulment action was pending. Ex-wife contested the motion because under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect;&sect; 236, 237, alimony and counsel fees were not available to a husband, only to a wife. The court granted ex-husband's motion for temporary alimony and interim counsel fees. The court held that the New York alimony statute could not survive constitutional examination, and that in excluding women from ever paying alimony, it rested on a flat distinction between genders that had no rational basis and was a suspect differentiation that served no compelling state interest. The court held that alimony was always an individual affair; the particular facts and circumstances of relative need, standards, and resources were to always be weighed, and that so long as each case was examined individually, no reason existed to preclude husbands.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found in favor of ex-husband, granted his motion for temporary alimony and counsel fees, and awarded him temporary alimony and a modest interim counsel fee in ex-wife's annulment action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and wife -- alimony and allowances -- counsel fees -- payments to husbands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The New York alimony statute (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 236), in excluding women from ever paying alimony, discriminates unconstitutionally.  The statute rests on the impermissible assumption that wives may depend on their husbands for suitable support, but husbands never so depend on their wives. This flat distinction between husband and wife has no rational basis and beyond that is a suspect differentiation which serves no compelling State interest.  Individual need is a determinative factor in alimony, and, in fact, a self-supporting wife may be denied alimony altogether.  So long as each case is to be examined individually, there is no reason to preclude husbands.  Even if the preclusion of men were found to be rational, the sex distinction still fails because it is inherently suspect and the discrimination cannot be justified by a compelling State interest.  New York legislative policy favors the elimination of gender distinctions in domestic relations and beyond, and, therefore, the sex distinctions of the alimony statute do not serve the State interest.  Moreover, the rationale&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of equality of women excludes the denial of male alimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The court has the power to direct alimony to husbands.  Even though section 236 of the Domestic Relations Law is rendered defective by virtue of gender discrimination, the court has the inherent power to remedy the discrimination of the statute without being required to strike the entire statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Under the temporary and permanent alimony provisions of section 236 of the Domestic Relations Law, which must also cover husbands, the court has discretion to award alimony as justice requires.  A husband is entitled to suitable support and need not be reduced to a public charge. Accordingly, under the circumstances of this case, where the wife has significant savings and an apparent income and brought her nonimmigrant alien husband to this country, where he cannot legally work but where he must remain to effectively contest the annulment action, the husband is awarded temporary alimony of $ 60 per week pending the actual trial of the annulment action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Section 237 of the Domestic Relations Law, pertaining to counsel fees, suffers the same infirmity as the alimony statute (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 236), by providing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in part that in any action brought to annul a marriage &quot;the court may direct the husband * * * to pay such sum or sums of money to enable the wife to carry on or defend the action&quot;.  These sex distinctions are as invalid here as in the alimony statute and must be stricken.  Accordingly, since the husband cannot afford counsel, he is awarded an interim counsel fee of $ 500.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner decided not to continue his registration of the history and English doctoral programs at the State University of New York at Albany.

The Commissioner and the Regents moved to dismiss. Both sides moved for summary judgment. The court found that the action as to the history program was barred by the four-month statute of limitations in N.Y. C.P.L.R. 217.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The Regents of the University of the State of New York and the Commissioner of Education have the power to approve, register and terminate graduate programs in the State University system.  The commissioner's determination in refusing to reregister the doctoral programs in English at the State University of New York at Albany was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The regents were within their authority to provide, through the commissioner, for the registration of courses in institutions of higher education in the State pursuant to the broad legislative power granted to the regents under section 207 of the Education Law to determine the educational policies of the State and to establish rules for carrying into effect the laws and policies of the State relating to education.  Section 207 is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The Legislature may validly enact statutes in broad outline leaving to administrative officials enforcing them the duty to arrange the details.  The regents have registered programs since 1787 and have conducted such registration through&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the commissioner since 1910.  The fact that the Board of Trustees of the State University of New York have the authority to administer the internal affairs of the State University (L 1961, ch 388) does not divest the regents and the commissioner of their power to approve programs in all institutions of higher education in the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The determination of the commissioner revoking the registration of the history doctoral program at the State University of New York at Albany is not subject to review in an article 78 proceeding since the action was not commenced within four months of the determination to be reviewed ( CPLR 217).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the action by the State against defendant refuse collectors, the refuse collectors sought to invalidate Geneva, N.Y. Ordinance &sect; 90.40 as unconstitutional because the ordinance required trash to be disposed of at a landfill site designated by the City of Geneva (city).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Geneva, N.Y. Ordinance &sect; 90.40 required that trash generated from the city had to be disposed of at a particular landfill or at any other landfill site designated by the city. The city charged the refuse collectors with violating the ordinance. The court granted the collectors' motion to declare the ordinance unconstitutional. The court held that municipal ordinances were entitled to a presumption of constitutionality and that the regulation of trash was a matter that was directly connected to the protection of public health and within the proper exercise of the city's police powers accorded by N.Y. Const. art. IX, N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect;&sect; 19 and 20, and N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 10. The court found that the city had a duty to make provisions for the sanitary disposal of refuse, but that the ordinance violated both federal and state constitutions because it was unreasonable and arbitrary.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- refuse collection -- required disposal of refuse in landfill outside city limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provisions of the refuse collection ordinance of the City of Geneva requiring that all ashes, rubbish and trash generated in the city be delivered for disposal to the Ontario County landfill site located seven miles outside the city limits are unconstitutionally unreasonable and arbitrary.  Defendants are refuse collectors in the city who were charged with disposing of trash in another sanitary landfill located one mile from the city limits in violation of the ordinance. Although the city had the power to enact an ordinance providing for the sanitary disposal of collected garbage and trash at a landfill site outside the city limits within the exercise of its broad police power to protect the health and well-being of its citizens&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and visitors, the actual effect of the ordinance was violative of both the Federal and State Constitutions.  Although the ordinance requires the disposal of all rubbish and trash at the county landfill site and prescribes substantial penalties for each violation thereof, the city has no control over who may be permitted by the county to use the landfill, nor does the city have any control over what rubbish and trash may be disposed and dumped at the landfill. A city license is valueless in assuring admittance to the landfill since each refuse collector who hauls refuse to the county landfill must also be licensed under the county's rules and regulations and be subject to the county's &quot;necessary control procedures&quot;.  A city-licensed hauler could therefore be denied the use of the county landfill after legally collecting refuse in the city, thereby unlawfully subjecting the hauler to the penalties imposed for violating the ordinance. A municipality may not demand certain performance by legislative fiat and at the same time provide for the punishment for such failure, when compliance may be rendered impossible by a third party.  </SPAN></P>

The inmate argued that the addition of delinquent time was contrary to law. Upon review, the court found the inmate's argument without merit. The inmate was sentenced to the reformatory in 1973 upon his conviction for a class C felony, whereby he subjected himself to a 15-year penitentiary sentence, and his having been sentenced to the reformatory on a zero to four indeterminate sentence constituted an adequate quid pro quo.

The court found that the term unnecessary could be used to define a standard if the intent of the statute, as it was in the instant case, was to prohibit a conduct which was something in excess of what was well understood to be the norm by a reasonable man through everyday knowledge. Therefore, the ordinance at issue was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Town ordinance which prohibits &quot;unnecessary emission of smoke, noxious gases, deposits, dust, trade wastes&quot; and other pollutants from buildings is not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.  The term &quot;unnecessary&quot; may be used to define a standard where the intent of the statute is to prohibit a conduct which is something in excess of what is well understood to be the norm by a reasonable man through everyday knowledge.  The unnecessary discharge of pollutants prohibited by the ordinance is that discharge which is greater than the amount considered to be reasonable with regard to the particular activity.  Defendant is lawfully convicted of unnecessarily discharging pollution into the air by sandblasting a car in his home garage located on a residential street.

Law &sect; 381(6), which required that any person operating or riding upon a motorcycle should wear a protective helmet. There was no dispute as to the facts of noncompliance with the statute on the part of defendants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the statute was enacted only to qualify the State for federal highway construction funds and that the legislation was invalid where it was &quot;special legislation&quot; and discriminatory. Defendants argued that there was no rational basis between the statute and the purposes intended and that the legislation was not a proper exercise of the police power of the State. The court held that: (1) it was of no importance that the triggering device for the statute was the desire to qualify for federal highway funds; (2) the class upon which the statute fell was a large one, clearly identifiable, and the statute operated upon all of them equally and without exception; (3) it was not unreasonable for the legislature to come to a belief that a cyclist falling to the ground at great speed would sustain greater personal injuries to his head without a helmet than with one; (4) the right to operate a motorcycle on the public highways was not such a &quot;fundamental right&quot; as to require that regulation could be justified only by a &quot;compelling State interest;&quot; and (5) the statute appeared to be well founded and there was a clear and rational basis between it and the purposes intended.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision 6 of section 381 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, requiring operators of motorcycles to wear helmets, should not be declared unconstitutional. It is of no significance that the helmet requirements for State qualification for Federal highway funds, which triggered the enactment of the statute, have been eliminated. Section 381 does not constitute special legislation, since it applies to a large, clearly identifiable class with like effect upon all in the class for a public purpose. While the statistical evidence mandates no conclusion, it was not unreasonable for the Legislature to believe that helmets would reduce injuries, and the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Legislature.  The right to operate a motorcycle on the public highways is not so fundamental as to require a compelling State interest, and the statute protects the public health, safety and welfare from the effects of injuries to motorcyclists, such as the costs of medical care, unemployment, rehabilitation, increased welfare costs and unemployment taxes and the effect upon family relations.  The failure of the Legislature to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  address itself to other matters affecting the public does not render the selected regulation arbitrary.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The recipient had a home health aide to assist her with daily living tasks. The aide was paid by the New York City Department of Social Services. She was also the recipient's daughter-in-law. The Department discontinued payment to the aide because N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 365-a(2)(d) (1973) disqualified her, as a family member, from being paid. Thereafter, a fair hearing was held and the City Commissioner held that the aid was not disqualified. That decision made no mention of the disqualification provisions of &sect; 365-a(2)(d) or N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 505.14(g)(1). When the Department failed to comply with that decision the recipient filed her petition under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78. The State Commissioner thereafter held a fair hearing which upheld the initial decision to end payments. In an amended petition, the recipient sought affirmation of the first fair hearing decision and reversal of the second decision. The court held that the City Commissioner was required to comply with the first decision up to the date of the second hearing, but not afterwards. The court also held that there nothing unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, or capricious about the second decision.</SPAN></P>

However, since a local agency has the right to conduct another fair hearing on its own when it is of the opinion that another fair hearing is warranted because of an erroneous decision of the State Department of Social Services (Social Services Law, &sect; 366-a, subds 5, 6), respondent is only required to pay petitioner's daughter-in-law for her services up to the date of the second decision after fair hearing which affirmed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  respondent's proper discontinuance of payment for services provided by petitioner's daughter-in-law. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff physicians, who were teachers for defendants, a university and associated parties, sought a summary judgment and dismissal of defendants' defenses to the physicians' action to have N.Y. Educ. Law &sect;&sect; 385-a to 385-i declared unconstitutional and inapplicable to the fees for their private medical services. The physicians also sought an injunction against defendants to prohibit them from enforcing the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants claimed that the physicians' action did not raise a case or controversy in that no corporation had yet been established pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect;&sect; 385-a to 385-i to collect the physicians' private income, but that the statute did authorize defendants to establish a corporation for that purpose. The court determined that the contention of defendants that they were authorized by &sect;&sect; 385-a to 385-i to establish a corporation to collect the physicians' income from their private practices created a justiciable controversy that was ripe for the court to decide and it was appropriate for a summary judgment. The court held that the intent shown in N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 385-a, when read with the definitions contained in N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 385-b, showed that only the physicians' income related to their employment with defendants was to be collected under the statutory scheme and that the income from their private practices was not included. The court further concluded that it was not necessary to determine the constitutionality of the statutory scheme or grant injunctive relief to the physicians based upon the court's interpretation of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect;&sect; 385-a to 385-i.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 8-AA of the Education Law, which provides that State medical colleges could establish and require its teaching professionals, as a condition of employment, to become members of a Clinical Practice Income Management Corporation, which would &quot;collect, manage and disburse, on behalf of the medical or dental school, all clinical practice income generated by employees of the school in connection with their employment&quot; (Education Law, &sect; 385-e), does not encompass services rendered by such teaching professionals and the fees they earn in their private practice.  Article 8-AA is applicable to only those services rendered by doctors in connection with their employment as teaching professionals at State medical colleges.  The purpose and intent of article 8-AA is to provide for a more improved system at a State medical center for the collection of, and accounting for, income generated by the teaching professionals for the medical center in the course of performing services related to their employment (Education Law, &sect; 385-a).  The doctors' private practice income has not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been income to which the medical center was entitled and, consequently, has never been part of any ongoing system which the statute was designed to improve.  In harmony with the over-all construction of the statute, the requirement that the services rendered be employment related is read into the definitions of &quot;clinical practice&quot; and &quot;clinical practice income&quot;, which on their face, apply to &quot;all income resulting from fees charged for professional services rendered in connection with clinical practice&quot; (Education Law, &sect; 385-b).  Such construction of article 8-AA avoids the possibility of the statute being found unconstitutional as a deprivation of due process or equal protection of the laws.  </SPAN></P>

Consequently, the order was an unwarranted exercise of legislative power that violated N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, which gave the legislature the power to make laws.

The applicants contended that the state failed to show a compelling interest to justify the infringement of the applicants' rights. The court agreed that the state constitution established a right fundamental to the relationship between the State of New York and its needy citizens. The court concluded that N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 158, insofar as it raised a substantial barrier to the efforts of some needy children to obtain the public assistance necessary to their maintenance of a minimal level of health, nutrition, and security, but left other needy children, similarly situated, without such a barrier, violated the equal protection clause of N.Y. Const. Art. I, &sect; 11. Accordingly, the court enjoined the state from permitting any further implementation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision (a) of section 158 of the Social Services Law (as amd by L 1976, ch 76, &sect; 15), which denies all home relief public assistance to certain needy children under the age of 21 years who are living apart from a legally responsible relative until a final order of disposition is obtained against such responsible relative in a support proceeding, while not imposing the same eligibility requirements upon other similarly situated needy children eligible for benefits under the Federally subsidized aid to families with dependent children program, is violative of the State equal protection clause (NY Const, art I, &sect; 11).  The State's obligation to provide for the &quot;aid, care and support of the needy&quot; (NY Const, art XVII, &sect; 1) is a constitutionally protected &quot;fundamental&quot; right which cannot be abridged unless there can be shown both a compelling governmental interest requiring the infringement and that there exists no less restrictive means available to the State to achieve such a compelling State interest.  The interest of the State in effecting fiscal savings&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the implementation of welfare programs is not of a sufficiently compelling nature to permit the infringement of a &quot;fundamental&quot; constitutional right resulting from the disparate treatment of similarly circumstanced needy children.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A group of city employees filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 1106-5.0, which required elected officials and city personnel to file annual statements disclosing information of a personal financial nature, was unconstitutional and enjoining its enforcement. The city, mayor, and acting city clerk moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. The court found that (1) the action was appropriately maintained as a class action covering appropriate individuals earning a salary in excess of the minimum requirement for enforcement of the code, (2) those city employees whose base pay did not meet the minimum requirement lacked standing, (3) the classification of those positions meeting the minimum salary requirements as managerial or policymaking in nature was not arbitrary and did not involve a curtailment of a constitutional right, (4) particularly in light of the fact that the city employees' contentions of vagueness were relatively speculative, it was reasonable that the ordinance require city employees, though not their spouses, to file the required reports, and (5) therefore the motion for summary judgment was granted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public officers -- financial disclosure -- right of privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 1106-5.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York (Local Laws, 1975, No. 1 of City of New York), which requires city employees whose base salary is $ 25,000 a year or more and their spouses to disclose personal financial data which is then made available for public inspection (New York City Charter, &sect;&sect; 1113, 1114), does not unconstitutionally violate such employees' rights of privacy. An expectation of privacy with respect to an individual's financial affairs is not a fundamental right entitled to special constitutional safeguards.  The methods of disclosure employed by the statute are &quot;reasonable and appropriate&quot; to accomplish the legitimate governmental purposes of discouraging and detecting corruption and the appearance of corruption, of avoiding conflicts of interests and of instilling in the public a sense of confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the public service. The city council reasonably concluded that those earning $ 25,000 or more presented entirely distinct problems justifying&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  disclosure even if some nonmanagerial personnel were drawn into the classification. Plaintiffs have not rebutted the statutory presumption that those positions in the classified civil service which fall above a minimum salary of $ 25,000 involve functions or responsibilities of such a nature as to require public disclosure of outside financial interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The broad scope of required financial disclosure, which might require reporting of financial data unrelated to any city activity or to the public office in general, does not warrant holding the financial disclosures law unconstitutional on its face.  It would be an insurmountable legislative task to tailor disclosure to each of a myriad of public posts and an anomaly to enact a statute designed to eliminate conflicts of interests so as to permit the person affected to decide when a financial interest relates to his public employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The availability of the financial statements to the public is not unrelated to the purpose of the statute of fostering public confidence in the integrity of the public service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The absence of administrative machinery to review the propriety of public disclosure in individual cases (cf. Executive&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Order No. 10; 9 NYCRR 3.10) does not render the statute constitutionally defective.  A requirement that a line be drawn which insures that no city employee whose responsibilities might not be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest will be subjected to unnecessary financial disclosure would unreasonably encumber effective administration and permit many clear violators to escape regulation entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The alleged infringement on the right of association which might result from the required disclosure of income sources, debts, gifts and honoria is highly speculative, and absent a showing of an actual chilling effect on associational activities, does not justify holding the statute unconstitutional on its face.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought to convict defendant of driving while intoxicated under N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. &sect; 1192(3). Defendant contended that at most he was driving while impaired and that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped after he was observed swerving. Defendant appeared intoxicated to a police officer. Defendant took a breathalyzer test, which registered a .15 percent level of blood alcohol. Prior case law had found the statute unconstitutional. The court convicted defendant of driving while impaired. While case law held the statute unconstitutional, new case law at least in part upheld its constitutionality. Driving while intoxicated required a finding that a defendant was &quot;very, very drunk.&quot; The court rejected the argument that a blood alcohol level beyond .09999 percent created a conclusive presumption that a person was intoxicated. Rather, a rebuttable presumption was created, and the use of a blood alcohol test did not alter the presumption. The State did not establish that defendant was &quot;very, very drunk.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under subdivision 3 of section 1192 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, a blood alcohol reading of .10 or greater merely gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that a person is driving while intoxicated. Consequently, even after a blood alcohol reading of .10 or greater has been admitted into evidence, any proof indicating that defendant was not &quot;very, very drunk&quot; would tend to upset the presumption of intoxication. In the absence of a blood alcohol test, the proof required to convict for driving while intoxicated must be overwhelming. If a person is intoxicated, he is no more or less so because a blood alcohol test has been administered. If the proof necessary to sustain a conviction without a test is that a defendant must have been &quot;very, very drunk&quot;, the same standard must apply when there is a test.  Accordingly, defendant, whose car was observed swerving slightly, who had some difficulty speaking and bloodshot eyes, and a blood alcohol reading of .15, is only guilty of driving while impaired (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 1192, subd 1).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner promulgated new regulations, N.Y. Comp.

The driver had one such conviction and was compelled to pay an increased fee to obtain a renewal of her operator's license. She filed suit for declaratory and injunctive relief. The Commissioner sought summary judgment and dismissal, asserting he was entitled to levy the additional fees to fund driver improvement programs. The driver claimed that the Commissioner was without authority to increase the fees. The court agreed, holding that the Commissioner had misconstrued 1976 N.Y. Laws ch. 50. His authority was limited to appropriating existing fees to fund driver improvement programs. The driver's license fees that could be charged were specified and limited by N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traff.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In seven consolidated actions, the state filed motions to dismiss as untimely filed claimants' causes of action for false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claims arose from a mass arrest of the claimants. The next day, after all claimants were formally booked, the criminal charges were dismissed and each claimant was released from custody. The state sought to dismiss the claims on the ground that they were untimely filed. The court granted the motion in part and denied it in part. Although the claims were timely filed under the Court of Claims Act, &sect; 10, subd. 3, the state argued that the limitations period for these claims was really only one year because of the language in N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 19 and the Court of Claims Act, &sect; 12, subd. 2. The court upheld the Court of Claims Act, &sect; 10, subd. 3 because it did not subject the state to less favorable time limitations than private citizens. The causes of action for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution were timely and constitutionally filed. The causes of action for malicious prosecution and negligence were sufficiently included in the notices of intention and therefore timely filed, except as to the alleged negligence of the state in training and supervising its police members. That allegation was stricken and the cause of action related to it was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the state's motion to dismiss as to the alleged negligence of the state in training and supervising its police members and struck that allegation. The court denied the motion as to the causes of action for false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and the remaining claims of negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- claims against State -- timely filing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On August 15, 1974, the day after claimants were subjected to a mass arrest, charges against them were dropped and each was released.  Within 90 days identical notices of intention were filed on behalf of each claimant, and within two years identical claims (except as to damages) were filed (Court of Claims Act, &sect; 10, subd 3), with each generally alleging causes of action for false imprisonment, malicious prosecution and negligence.  Based on the contention that if the false imprisonment and malicious prosecution causes of action had been brought between citizens a one-year Statute of Limitations would apply ( CPLR 215, subd 3), and that since both section 19 of article III of the New York State Constitution and subdivision 2 of section 12 of the Court of Claims Act state in substantially similar language that no action may be brought against the State that would be time-barred if brought as against citizens, defendant made a motion to dismiss these causes of action for untimely filing.  The motion is denied.  Subdivision 3 of section&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  10 of the Court of Claims Act does not conflict unconstitutionally with section 19 of article III of the New York Constitution. Since a notice of intention contains all that is required in a summons and more, the notice is deemed sufficiently comparable to a summons to find that the filing of such notice affords the State a more, not less, favorable time limitation than that applicable between citizens.  Moreover, the notices of intention filed here may be treated as claims with respect to false imprisonment, and satisfactorily include causes of action for malicious prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Allegations of negligence in the notices of intention were sufficient to support the claims of negligence against the State Police for participating in an unlawful arrest and search, with the resulting alleged deprivation of claimants' civil liberty, and of the negligence of agents of the State in failing to verify the existence of probable cause.  However, nothing in the notices referred to the State's alleged negligent training and supervision of members of its police, and the cause of action of negligence emanating from it is stricken. </SPAN></P>

In order to sustain an indictment or information for driving while intoxicated, a chemical blood test will be required, or in the absence of such test, the indictment or information and proof must show that the defendant was very, very drunk. Where a defendant has not submitted to chemical analysis and the indictment or information does not clearly show that defendant was very, very drunk, the charge must be limited to driving while ability impaired. Since defendant submitted to a chemical test his case is remanded for trial.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two cars collided. One of the drivers who was not at fault was seriously injured. Her insurance company compensated her for her injuries. The insurer of the not-at-fault insured then sought arbitration to recover first party benefits paid to its insured from the insurer of the at-fault insured pursuant to N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 674. The at-fault insurer petitioned the court to stay the arbitration proceedings. The court determined that the not-at-fault insurer was entitled to recovery of the money paid to its insured from the at-fault insurer and was not limited by the amount specified on the at-fault insured's policy.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The obligation of petitioner insurance company under section 674 of the Insurance Law to reimburse respondent insurer for payments of first-party benefits made to respondent's insured is not constitutionally limited by the underlying limits of petitioner's liability coverage for its insured. Petitioner's insured was allegedly the atfault party in causing the automobile accident in Suffolk County which seriously injured respondent's insured. In addition to containing provision for no-fault benefits, petitioner's policy provided liability coverage of $ 10,000/$ 20,000 for personal injuries and $ 5,000 for property damage.  The statutory mandate permitting respondent insurer to recover by arbitration the first-party benefits paid to its insured from petitioner insurer to the extent that petitioner's insured would have been liable, but for the no-fault act, to pay damages in an action at law (Insurance Law, &sect; 674, subd 1), does not unlawfully impose on petitioner a liability which it did not contract to assume.  Petitioner can have no greater right to a common-law action than&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  its insured has.  Its only redress is the arbitral process created by the statute to which a right of trial by jury does not attach.  Reallocation of loss through an intercompany arbitration procedure helps achieve the objects of the no-fault law of eliminating the vast majority of auto accident negligence suits from the courts and assuring prompt compensation to accident victims of substantially all of their economic loss without regard to fault. In writing insurance in this State, petitioner necessarily assumed the obligations imposed by the statute.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After several adjournments following defendant's arraignment on a felony complaint for assault in the second degree, for criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree, and for criminal mischief in the third degree, under N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 120.05, 265.01, 145.05, the original charges were reduced to misdemeanors of harassment and of criminal mischief in the fourth degree, under N.Y.

The court held that: (1) the delay was within the prescribed 90-day period, as calculated from the date of the filing of the new accusatory instrument; (2) there was no due process violation because a 90-day speedy trial rule was not a constitutional requirement for all misdemeanor cases; and (3) there was no equal protection violation as defendant was not being singled out for special treatment from among all those whose prosecution commenced with a felony complaint, which was then replaced or converted to an information, to a prosecutor's information, or to a misdemeanor complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  CPL 30.30 (subd 5, par [c]) which provides that where a &quot;felony complaint is replaced or converted to an information, prosecutor's information or misdemeanor complaint&quot; the 90-day period within which a trial must be commenced ( CPL 30.30, subd 1) is &quot;calculated from the date of the filing of such new accusatory instrument&quot; provided that the permissible time period, not counting that which is expressly excludable, does not exceed six months, does not deprive defendant of his constitutional right to due process.  Defendant was arraigned on August 20, 1975 on a felony complaint.  On November 5, 1975 after a number of adjournments, the original felony charges were reduced to misdemeanor charges and set down for trial for December 1, 1975.  Defendant's motion pursuant to CPL 30.30 to dismiss the charges against him on the ground of denial of his right to a speedy trial was properly dismissed since the delay involved was well within the 90-day period permitted by CPL 30.30 (subd 5, par [c]) as calculated from the date of the filing of the new accusatory&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  instrument. Where a criminal action is commenced by the filing of a felony complaint and is then replaced or converted to an information, prosecutor's information or misdemeanor complaint it does not necessarily follow that a defendant's constitutional rights have been abridged by reason of the fact that more than 90 days may have elapsed between the bringing of the initial charge and the start of trial.  The 90-day speedy trial limitations within CPL 30.30 are stricter than those required by constitutional standards.  The denial of a speedy trial depends upon such factors as the length of the delay, the reason assigned by the prosecution to justify the delay and prejudice to the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  CPL 30.30 (subd 5, par [c]) does not arbitrarily and capriciously deprive defendant of a speedy trial as guaranteed to others initially charged with misdemeanor offenses.  There are legitimate reasons why a criminal action may be commenced through a felony complaint and end up being prosecuted as a misdemeanor. </SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court found that the employee was not entitled to having his motion granted. If the employee succeeded, $ 5,000 would have been removed from the insurer's coffers and placed in the employees because an action was brought to judgment after June, 1975 rather than before June, 1975, the effective date of the statute. That would have been a very concrete substantive result of an adjective, procedure change. The insurer's lien on any third-party recovery was a vested right. The insurer's lien vested when it applied its first dollar to the employee's use. It was then a full lien. It could not have been diminished.</SPAN></P>

Prior to June 10, 1975 section 29 of the Workmen's Compensation Law granted compensation insurance carriers full liens against third-party recoveries, but chapter 190 of the Laws of 1975 provided for equitable apportionment of the costs of a third-party recovery between the insurance company lienor and the covered employee.  Upon plaintiff's motion that chapter 190 of the Laws of 1975 be construed retroactively and that one third of his costs in recovering the third-party claim be apportioned against the lienor carrier's lien, the motion is denied.

On appeal, the court held that: (1) section 280.20 was unconstitutional, and the conviction on the conspiracy count violated the Fifth Amendment double jeopardy prohibition because there was a judgment during trial discharging him of the conspiracy count; (2) retrial on the substantive crimes were permissible because they were not dismissed before the mistrial was declared; and (3) the trial of the indictment containing the conspiracy count were not precluded by res judicata or by collateral estoppel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant's conviction on a conspiracy charge, which had been dismissed by a trial order of dismissal prior to the declaration of a mistrial in defendant's first trial, is barred by the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment. Defendant was convicted of conspiracy, criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance and criminal possession of a weapon in his new trial, which resulted from the declaration of mistrial in the first trial.  CPL 280.20, which provides that an indictment in a new trial resulting from a mistrial, &quot;is deemed to contain all the counts which it contained at the time the previous trial was commenced, regardless of whether any count was thereafter dismissed by the court prior to the mistrial order&quot;, is unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this case.</SPAN></P>

The dismissal of the conspiracy charge in the first trial on the ground that there was no direct proof of an express agreement did not bar the subsequent prosecution for the substantive crimes under the doctrines of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and collateral estoppel. The findings of fact supporting the trial order of dismissal did not determine any issue necessarily decisive in the second trial.  There is no reasonable possibility that any evidence presented at the second trial was precluded by the prior trial order of dismissal.  The dismissal did not go to proof of the overt acts charged in the conspiracy or the substantive&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  crimes.  No finding was made with respect to the proof of the requisite knowledge or intent for the substantive crimes or whether defendant intentionally aided any other person in the commission of the crimes charged. The proof that defendant's actions constituted the elements of the substantive crimes either as a principal or an accessory, did not require direct proof of any express agreement. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner voters, on behalf of the people of New York, challenged a decision by respondents, two district boards of inspectors of election, in which the boards found they were entitled to vote in a general election for president, but did not afford them a reasonable means to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was determined on election day, by the boards, that the voters were qualified, and were improperly denied the right to vote. Each voter had appeared at his local polling place an hour or two before the closing time for the polling places, and had had their eligibility determined at 20 minutes before the closing hour. Upon determining eligibility, the board sent the voters back to their local polling place, but that was insufficient time for the voters to arrive at the local polling place in order to vote. This action was brought to determine if the boards' actions were correct. The court held that the board was required to do one of two alternate things under these circumstances. It was required to provide a facility for the exercise of the vote at the place where the voter's application was officially upheld, or it was required to direct the local polling place to remain open for a reasonable period to await the voter's arrival. The reasoning was that the right to vote was fundamental, and the administrative convenience of the board could not act to prevent the voter his fundamental right to vote.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found the board was required to either provide a central facility for the exercise of the unlawfully refused vote, or it must direct the local polling place to remain open for a reasonable period to await the voter's arrival.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed a motion to dismiss three health and building code violations on the ground that the summonses were issued pursuant to a plan of selective and discriminatory law enforcement of the Administrative Code against &quot;sex related&quot; establishments. Defendants were employees of an adult bookstore in the downtown area, which specialized in viewing machines for &quot;peep shows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The people claimed that the task force's concentrated prosecution of health and building violations against certain establishments was a legitimate response to the public concern over conditions in the midtown area which included the recognized, long-standing problem of the high incidence of crime and general deterioration of the area associated with the proliferation of businesses catering to commercial sex. At issue, was whether constitutional boundaries had been violated by the enforcement activities conducted by the task force. A decision had been made to deploy resources against sex-related establishments. Defendants claimed their right to nondiscriminatory prosecution under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated. The people conceded that defendants had been purposefully selected for intentional emphasis on prosecution. The court held the concentrated effort of the task force, assuming it was aimed at sex-related establishments, was rationally related to legitimate law enforcement objectives. The court held that until the city had resources to prosecute all code violations, the selective enforcement decided upon was both rational and permissible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although purposeful selective enforcement of building and health code violations has been shown against defendants, employees of &quot;sex related&quot; establishments, by the Midtown Task Force, defendants have been unable to demonstrate that the decision to concentrate enforcement upon members of their class was based upon an arbitrary classification. The test of whether a prosecutor has made a reasonable classification should be judged along lines of permissible prosecutorial discretion, as well as by whether a particular classification bears a rational relationship to the broad purposes of the criminal law and is reasonably related to law enforcement objectives.  The mandate of the Federally funded Midtown Enforcement Project is the &quot;identification, investigation, and prosecution of illegal activities endemic to the midtown area of New York County.&quot; As a result of past ineffective efforts to curtail these illegal activities, it was determined to concentrate efforts on insuring compliance with safety and health-related ordinances.  This concentrated effort, even&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  if aimed at sex-related establishments, is rationally related to legitimate law enforcement objectives.  Health and building codes are well within the police power. Accordingly, in view of the lack of resources to vigorously prosecute all such offenses, the selective enforcement of the Administrative Code of the City of New York decided upon herein is both rational and permissible.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was an attorney that was indicted for bribery of a witness in violation of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the jury panel selected for his trial did not fairly represent the community because females had been systematically excluded from jury service by allowing them to excuse themselves and there had been a delay in the trial that denied him a right to a speedy trial. The court determined that the jury panel that had been selected for his trial was not representative of the community in that it had a percentage of females that was not similar to the makeup of the community. The court further determined that after an objection was sustained to the jury panel, a jury panel was not selected that was consistent with the makeup of the community. Defendant was denied a speedy trial by the failure of the State to provide a forum for the charges brought against him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- composition of jury -- speedy trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charges against defendant arose out of incidents which occurred in early 1972, but an indictment was not signed and filed until April of 1974, with the case being set down for trial in February of 1975.  In January of 1975 the United States Supreme Court decided </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Taylor v Louisiana</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (419 U.S. 522), and thereafter defendant moved to dismiss the indictment because of the New York statutory exemption of women from jury service and their consequent underrepresentation on the Grand Jury which voted the indictment. A challenge was also made to the composition of the petit jury venire. The case was then adjourned to await reconstitution of the Richmond County venire or pool of qualified jurors to bring it into compliance with constitutional requirements.  The motion to dismiss the indictment in the interest of justice and because of the denial of the right to a speedy trial is granted.  The entire petit jury panel of Richmond County is hopelessly and irredeemably tainted by methods of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  qualification which are contrary to established constitutional requirements, State law and court rules in that the systems and procedures for selecting qualified persons for the jury pool precludes the obtaining of a fair cross section of the community as to age and sex, and is overly imbalanced by persons who have previously served.  Since defendant was ready for trial in February, 1975 and the county has had considerable opportunity to correct the unlawful condition, the State has failed to fulfill its obligation of providing a forum for the resolution of the charges it has brought.  Nor can the condition be corrected by a make-shift selection from the present jury roll, since there is no reason why, almost two years later, a court should have to invent an impromptu method of giving defendant a constitutionally acceptable jury.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, current and former public assistance recipients, filed suit against defendants, the New York City Department of Social Services and its commissioner, challenging their policy of obtaining confessions of judgment. Plaintiffs filed an application for a determination that the suit be permitted to be maintained as a &quot;class action&quot; pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 9 and that, as such &quot;class action,&quot; summary judgment be granted to plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose from the overpayments made by defendants to recipients in excess of the sum to which they were entitled or because of fraud or ineligibility. Plaintiffs sought summary judgment seeking to declare that defendants' practice of taking confessions of judgment from former and present recipients of public assistance who received overpayments of assistance be enjoined; that the confessions of judgment previously obtained from former and present recipients and filed in the state courts be vacated, and that defendants make restitution to those members of the class from whom payments were received or exacted through court sanctioned enforcement of judgment procedures. The court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint. The court was of the opinion that it could not be said that defendants' effort to recoup funds fraudulently or improperly obtained from defendants by unjustly or fraudulently enriched recipients was an act of assuming unauthorized power, power beyond legislative intended limits. The court held that the past or future acts of defendants in accepting, receiving, or even in demanding confessions of judgment for overpayments was not in derogation of the common law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint for lack of legal sufficiency in plaintiffs' action challenging defendants policy, procedure, and practice of obtaining confessions of judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant New York City Department of Social Services has the inherent right and implied power to demand and obtain &quot;confessions of judgment&quot; from former and present recipients of public assistance who received &quot;overpayments&quot; of assistance as the result of ineligibility or misrepresentation or concealment by the recipient. The department has no authority to enter into a &quot;stipulation&quot; relinquishing its right to recover &quot;overpayments&quot; of assistance.  The fact that the Social Services Law does not specifically authorize the department to obtain &quot;confessions of judgment&quot; in order to recover &quot;overpayments&quot; does not prohibit the department from utilizing said method of recoupment. To criminally or civilly prosecute recipients who have obtained public assistance illegally because of ineligibility or fraud, or to make legal efforts to seek reimbursement from those who have obtained &quot;overpayments&quot; erroneously is within the implied power of the department if not statutorily spelled out.  Section 106-b of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Social Services Law only requires the department to recoup &quot;overpayments&quot; from eligible recipients who received such &quot;overpayments&quot; through honest error on the part of the recipient or the department by reducing future payments to such recipient. Other &quot;overpayments&quot; whether made to &quot;ineligible&quot; persons or to persons who received assistance by fraudulent methods or representations may be collected by whatever legal means are available.</SPAN></P>

Since &quot;overpayments&quot; can have an innocent as well as fraudulent base, each matter must be considered separately. </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the award holding that the alleged &quot;unreasonableness&quot; of the arbitrator's findings was not a basis for vacating an award under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7511. The court concluded that if an arbitration award was reviewed for unreasonableness then the court would be required to pass on the record of innumerable arbitration awards and the parties would be forced into a second tier of litigation. The court further held that vacating an award because it was excessive under the circumstances, because it was &quot;unreasonable,&quot; an &quot;abuse of discretion,&quot; or &quot;shocking to one's sense of fairness,&quot; imported into N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7511 proceedings a degree of substantive review which it was the purpose of the statutory scheme to preclude.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The compulsory nature of arbitration of a claim for no-fault automobile insurance benefits does not subject the proceeding to a broader scope of review than that authorized under CPLR 7511, and review under CPLR 7511, utilizing a substantial evidence test, does not warrant interference with the fixing of attorney's fees.  To vacate an award because it is excessive, unreasonable, an abuse of discretion or shocking to one's sense of fairness would import into CPLR article 75 a degree of substantive review not therein intended.  So long as an award is not completely irrational, it must prevail, and it is not improper in a small but meritorious claim that the value of legal services rendered might exceed the claim.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to trial, defendant moved to suppress evidence and incriminating statements. The motion was denied but the court postponed its written order. Defendant was convicted him of murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree, and was sentenced to death. Defendant also moved for an order declaring the mandatory death penalty prescribed by N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 60.06&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree. Defendant claimed that certain statements he made to police and certain physical evidence should have been suppressed. The court held that defendant was adequately informed of his Miranda rights, and knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently elected to waive them when he made the statements he sought to suppress. Also, the court determined that facts were sufficient to warrant the police belief that fleeing fugitives were in defendant's apartment when they elected to make a warrantless entry into the dwelling. The police's warrantless entry into defendant's apartment was thus justified. Defendant's motion to suppress physical evidence and statements was thus denied. Further, the court found that the mandatory death penalty prescribed by N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 60.06 was unconstitutional as violative of U.S. Const. amends. VIII, XIV prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment, as it precluded a trial court from considering the character and circumstances of a defendant prior to imposition of a death sentence. Defendant's conviction was thus entered, and he was given a life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to suppress and entered judgment that convicted defendant on two counts of murder. However, the court determined that the New York statute that mandated imposing the death sentence on defendant was unconstitutional because it prohibited a trial court's consideration of the character and individual circumstances of a defendant prior to imposition of a death sentence. Defendant was thus sentenced to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- mandatory death penalty -- cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The mandatory death penalty prescribed by section 60.06 of the Penal Law upon a conviction for murder in the first degree (Penal Law, &sect; 125.27) is unconstitutional as violative of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against the imposition of cruel and unusual punishment.  Defendant, who killed a police officer while participating in an armed bank robbery with two other codefendants, is therefore sentenced to life imprisonment upon his conviction for murder in the first degree.  The death penalty for an aggravated form of murder is constitutionally permissible only if the sentence is discretionary and individualized within the framework of clearly prescribed and reasonable guidelines that safeguard against the arbitrary and capricious imposition of the death sentence (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Gregg v Georgia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 428 U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; 19 Cr L 3249). The Eighth Amendment does not sanction a death sentencing scheme which either rests upon unbridled jury discretion or which inexorably imposes a death sentence upon every defendant convicted of a capital offense.  Section 60.06 is unconstitutional since it proscribes any semblance of a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  discretionary sentence and fails to focus on the character, background and propensities of the convicted defendant.  The statutory scheme unconstitutionally accords neither the court nor the jury an opportunity to consider and assess any mitigating or aggravating factors respecting the offense or the offender. Developing standards of decency in a mature and stable society repudiate an automatic death sentence however heinous the condemned conduct may be.  The constitutional defectiveness of a mandatory death sentencing scheme is not corrected by legislative action that narrows the scope of capital murders to those where the defined attendant circumstances describe certain aggravating factors.  A bifurcated trial is required before the ultimate sanction of death is imposed upon a convicted murderer.  The United States Constitution requires that a jury, before recommending or fixing the death penalty, be accorded an opportunity to consider the character and background of the defendant as well as the attendant circumstances of the crime itself.  The sentencing authority must consider, after a guilty verdict, why the death penalty should be imposed and why it should not be imposed.  This&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  consideration must be made within the context of clear standards and guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant, a diabetic who was wounded in the upper arm during the course of the robbery, knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights.  Defendant's diabetic condition and the minor shoulder wound did not impair his ability to appreciate and understand his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights, nor did his physical condition impair his capacity to effectively waive such rights.  Defendant was not subjected to lengthy or harassing questioning.  His confessions to the police investigators were the product of a &quot;rational intellect and a free will&quot;.  Defendant was composed and in full control when he made the incriminating statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A steno pad containing the bank floor plan and a &quot;stickup note&quot; were lawfully seized from defendant's apartment pursuant to a valid search warrant. Defendant was seized immediately after the shooting.  However, his two codefendants escaped.  Defendant admitted that the robbery had been planned in his apartment the night before and then gave the police the keys to his apartment which was located less than one mile from the victimized bank.  The police lawfully proceeded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to make a warrantless and unannounced entry of defendant's apartment for the sole purpose of searching for and effecting the arrest of two dangerous and armed robbers who had just perpetrated a felony murder. Once inside the apartment, the police observed the steno pad and &quot;stickup note&quot; in plain view on a coffee table.  Once they determined that the two fugitives were not in the premises, the police left the apartment to obtain a search warrant which was issued at 8:40 p.m. without a &quot;night time&quot; search authorization ( CPL art 690).  The search was properly commenced before 9:00 p.m. The fact that one item of evidence was found and seized after 9:00 p.m. does not vitiate the validity of the warrant and the concomitant search and seizure.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Dead bodies -- funeral directing -- funeral directing by unlicensed person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A Health Department regulation, 10 NYCRR 77.7, which provides that only a duly licensed funeral director or undertaker shall make arrangements with one having the right to control the incidents of burial &quot;for the purchase, sale or rental of funeral merchandise, services or paraphernalia&quot; ( 10 NYCRR 77.7 [a] [5] [iii]) is not invalid insofar as it pertains to petitioner's funeral home operations.  The section is not unreasonable and does not conflict with the statutory scheme of the Public Health Law pertaining to the regulation of funeral directing, whereby the Commissioner of Health is empowered to &quot;govern and regulate the conduct and transaction of the business and practice of funeral directing, undertaking and embalming&quot; ( Public Health Law, &sect; 3401, subd 1, par [b]).  It is reasonable that only a licensed funeral director should arrange with one charged with the control or burial for the sale, purchase or rental of funeral merchandise or services, since such a requirement serves to carry out the legislative direction for regulation of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  funeral business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State moved to dismiss plaintiff property owner's action alleging that 1973 N.Y. Laws 348, which provided for a comprehensive and extensive system of land use controls applicable to privately-owned land within the Adirondack Park, constituted a &quot;taking&quot; of its property. The state contended that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that the claim failed to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole question presented was whether 1973 N.Y. Laws 348, which for the purposes of the motion was assumed to have substantial and severe economic impact upon the market value of the property owner's real property, might be considered as being tantamount to a de facto appropriation of such property for which just compensation must be awarded. The essence of the property owner's allegations of &quot;taking&quot; were that the controls imposed by the State were so restrictive that it had become infeasible to develop the property as planned or, in fact, to put it to any reasonable economic use. The court held that such were not the type of governmental acts that would constitute a &quot;taking&quot; as that term was used in appropriation law. On its face 1973 N.Y. Laws 348 was regulatory in nature. Its effect was not aimed specifically or directly at the property in issue. Rather, its restrictions were generally applied throughout the park, and would not necessarily be considered a &quot;taking&quot; of private property in all cases. The act was not an &quot;avowed taking statute.&quot; Thus, the court answered the question in the negative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the State's motion to dismiss the claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Environmental conservation -- Adirondack Park Agency Act -- de facto appropriation of property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Claimant's action for money damages is not a constitutional challenge to the validity of the Adirondack Park Agency Act (Executive Law, &sect; 800 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.), wherein the demand for money is merely incidental, but is a claim that the controls imposed under the act deprive claimant of almost all economic use of its property and constitute a taking.  Accordingly, the Court of Claims has jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Assuming a substantial and severe economic impact upon the value of claimant's real property, the land use regulatory act nevertheless does not constitute a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taking for which compensation must be awarded.  Although the restrictions are a direct legal restraint upon the economic use of the property, any interest taken is not compensable, since the restrictions merely alter the value of the property and make it infeasible for claimant to use the property as planned.  Allegations of such governmental action are more consistent with cases dealing with unreasonable exercises of police power than with those&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  brought under the theory of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appropriation. On its face the act is regulatory and the required filing of a map, rather than evidencing a taking, is a common feature of zoning law.  Proximity to State forest preserve lands, as a basis for project classification, is not an indicia of a taking but of regulation. Absent a systematic program of acquisition and condemnation, it cannot be said that a land use measure is necessarily a taking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The balancing of public and private interests required by the restriction of Adirondack Park lands would best be evaluated in an action in Supreme Court to have the controls declared unconstitutional in view of various policy considerations, including the vast financial impact which an award of money damages would entail.  Accordingly, the claim should be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that New York City, N.Y., Health Code &sect; 131.15 was designed to eliminate deaths and injuries and was within the powers to provide for security of life and health pursuant to New York City, N.Y., Charter &sect; 1706.

The court determined that defendants failed to explain how they had been singled out for unequal treatment, different from that afforded other defendants indicted in New York. The court held that because defendants were not public employees, it was all more unlikely that the mandate of the statute had an unequal impact upon them due to the exclusion of the group. The court further held that &sect; 598 was constitutional because it was not apparent that the exempting public employees from grand jury service posed any substantial threat to the remaining pool of prospective grand jurors.

The court held that there was no right to reimbursement for Medicaid correctly paid to a recipient from a responsible relative of the recipient. The department could recover Medicaid for medical assistance properly paid only from the estate of the recipient under certain conditions. The Legislature intended to meet all necessary Federal requirements under the Social Security Act. Thus, the court was required to interpret the law to insure that the Legislature's intent was carried out and so as not to jeopardize Federal reimbursement. The court determined that Congress did not want to permit the impoverishment of a recipient of medical assistance, or his otherwise responsible relatives, except in limited circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Social Services is not entitled to reimbursement from decedent's estate for Medicaid correctly paid to her husband during his lifetime. Prior to his death at age 78, decedent's husband had been paid Medicaid in the amount of $ 25,618.79.  Decedent, who was 82 years of age at the time of her death, had been paid Medicaid in the amount of $ 513.60.  The estate of decedent's husband had no assets which could be applied to the department's claim for reimbursement for the medical assistance paid him.  Decedent's estate, after payment of expenses totals $ 20,000.  It is the intent of Congress not to permit the impoverishment of a recipient of medical assistance, or his otherwise responsible relatives, except under limited circumstances.  No recovery for medical assistance properly paid may be had from the estate of a deceased recipient except from the estate of a deceased recipient who was 65 or over when he received such assistance and then only if he is not survived by a surviving spouse (US Code, tit 42, &sect; 1396a, subd [a]).  Recovery is permitted from a living spouse providing such spouse was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of &quot;sufficient ability&quot; during the period of assistance ( Social Services Law, &sect; 369).  However, there is no statutory authority allowing recovery from the estate of such spouse. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Chairman of the Public Service Commission of the State of New York filed a motion for summary judgment in a declaratory judgment action brought by plaintiff public employees to test the constitutionality of rules adopted by the Commission.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chairman argued that the rules concerning the disclosure of private financial holdings by the public employees were constitutional. The court stated that the rules under N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 74(3)(g) and (h) were intended to avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest by public employees who held any interest in public utility companies. The court noted that no disclosure was required at all if the public employees signed a sworn certification that they were in compliance with the statute. The court also determined that there was an exemption for the public employees if they disclosed to the Commission the names of the companies in which they had holdings, which threatened a conflict of interest and obtained permission to keep them. The court held that the public employees were not required to disclose all of their holdings and there was a process for judicial review of the Commission's decision. The court reasoned that the state had a compelling state interest in the financial privacy of its public employees and a limited intrusion was justified. The court concluded that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rules adopted by the Public Service Commission requiring covered employees to disclose conflict of interest financial holdings to the secretary of the commission, in accordance with the legislative policy of having public employees avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest (Public Officers Law, &sect; 74, subd 3, pars [g], [h]), are not unconstitutionally broad.  The rules prohibit the covered employees and their spouses and minor children from holding stocks, bonds or other interests in public utility corporations or in companies which derive 25% of revenues from supplying equipment to such utilities.  No exemptions are allowed for holdings in the utility itself except for the holdings of a spouse or minor child. An exemption may be sought by disclosing to the secretary of the commission only the names of companies in which they have holdings that threaten a conflict of interest and obtaining permission to keep them.  The State has a legitimate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  governmental interest in preventing conflicts of interest on the part of public officials and employees without unreasonably intruding into the personal privacy of such public employees. The rules adopted by the commission do not require an indiscriminate public disclosure of all holdings of every employee covered by the rules so as to invade constitutional privacy. No disclosure is required if there is private compliance and disclosure is only required in a questionable situation in which the employee desires to retain his holdings, and then the disclosure is only required to be made to the secretary of the commission for a ruling which is subject to judicial review.  Intrusion upon privacy is properly limited to matters of public concern by public employees and no employee is thereby barred from any investment that does not constitute a conflict of interest. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two cases, defendants filed motions to dismiss charges that they violated a village ordinance on the ground that the ordinance was a nullity. The ordinance prohibited the consumption of alcoholic beverages on any public street, public sidewalk, or public parking area within the village limits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended the village was without authority to enact the ordinance and that the ordinance deprived defendants of due process of law under the state and federal constitutions. The court disagreed. Under N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 10, and N.Y. Village Law &sect; 4-412, the village had broad power to regulate the use of the village streets, sidewalks, and parking areas and to provide for the preservation and promotion of the health, safety, and general welfare of its inhabitants. Any use of the streets that interfered unduly with the use of the streets by others for travel could doubtless be prohibited. The court found that the ordinance was unambiguous and left no question as to what conduct was prohibited. Further, the ordinance did not violate defendants' due process rights. It was a reasonable exercise of the municipal police power. In the light of local circumstances, the village board might reasonably have determined that the conduct prohibited would be unnecessarily offensive to the visual sensibilities as well as the safety, comfort, and general welfare of its citizens.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- restriction of public consumption of alcoholic beverages -- aesthetic considerations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Village Ordinance of the Village of Monticello, which prohibits any person from drinking or consuming &quot;an alcoholic beverage on any public street, public sidewalk or public parking area&quot; within the village limits, is a valid exercise of the municipal police power reasonably calculated to achieve a legitimate public purpose. The village has the broad power to regulate the use of the village streets, sidewalks and parking areas and to provide, by local law, for the good government of the village and the preservation and promotion of the health, safety and general welfare of its inhabitants (Village Law, &sect; 4-412; Municipal Home Rule Law, &sect; 10; NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2).  Aesthetic considerations and the appearance of the community are proper subjects of legislative concern in enacting reasonable laws designed to promote health and safety.  The ordinance does not prohibit the public consumption of nonalcoholic beverages nor does it prohibit the consumption of alcoholic beverages on private property or in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any place other than a public street, public sidewalk or public parking area. The village board reasonably determined that the conduct prohibited would be unnecessarily offensive to the visual sensibilities as well as the safety, comfort and general welfare of its citizens and would materially and economically detract from the community or impair good order or adversely affect trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The fact that the State has pre-empted the field in the regulation of the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages does not prohibit the enactment of the village ordinance which only restricts the public consumption of alcoholic beverages and does not deal with becoming intoxicated nor with the sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages. The village has not prohibited that which the State has specifically permitted.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a civil services employees association (CSEA), filed a suit against defendant county to recover damages on behalf of certain members who were not granted an annual salary increase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under a collective bargaining agreement executed by the county and the CSEA, employees were granted annual salary increases. After the county forecast a significant budget deficit, it directed administrative department heads to suspend the payment of the salary increases to county employees who earned more than a certain amount. The CSEA filed a complaint against the county and challenged the suspension of the salary increases. The court held that the suspension violated the collective bargaining agreement and that the affected employees were entitled to recover the monies withheld. There had been no legislatively declared emergency in the county, only an apprehension of an impending budget deficit. Judicial relief accorded to a nearby city, which had experienced a fiscal crisis and which was the object of a financial emergency act, was not applicable to the county in the absence of a legislatively declared emergency in the county. Moreover, the classifications relating to those employees whose salary increases were withheld violated equal protection. Withholding salary increases from one percent of the labor force would have a marginal impact on the projected deficit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the suspension of salary increases to a small group of county employees violated a collective bargaining agreement and that the employees could recover the monies that were withheld.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Counties -- fiscal emergency -- suspension of salary increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant Nassau County improperly withheld salary increments due on January 1, 1975 to employees earning in excess of $ 25,000 per annum in violation of the &quot;graded service plan&quot; in the parties' collective bargaining agreement which grants annual step increments to all county employees who are in the employ of the county on January 1 of each year.  The county Commissioner of Social Services, on his own initiative, improperly withheld the annual step increment from employees who had not been in the employ of the Social Services Department for less than one month prior to January 1, 1975.  In response to a forecasted $ 4,000,000 budget deficit for 1975, the County Executive directed administrative department heads to suspend the payment of annual step increments in salary to all county employees earning in excess of $ 25,000 per annum, who then numbered 45 employees out of 14,000.  Although the collective bargaining agreement provided that the head of a department could disapprove the granting of any increment, the parties by past practice interpreted the contract so as to allow the employer to withhold the increment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from an employee only for cause.  The county's fiscal emergency did not justify its actions against a handful of employees.  The suspension of benefits due government employees may be permissible in a time of extreme emergency. However, unlike the New York City fiscal emergency which caused the Legislature to suspend all &quot;increases in salary or wages of employees of the city&quot; (New York State Financial Emergency Act for City of New York; L 1975, ch 868, &sect; 2, as amd by L 1975, ch 870), there was no legislative declaration of fiscal emergency in the county, merely an apprehension by the Chief Executive of an impending budget deficit and the anticipated tax increase to flow therefrom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The selection of employees to be denied salary increments based only on the two standards of high income and late hirings created arbitrary unconstitutional classifications, which did not bear any reasonable relationship to the purpose put forth by the county.  The withholding of the step increment alone of 1% of the labor force would not do much to decrease a $ 4,000,000 budget deficit. Had there been State legislative action declaring a financial emergency in Nassau County followed by local legislative&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  enactments setting forth a plan at reducing or eliminating this deficit, such classifications may have been constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The county was not empowered to temporarily impair contract rights of its employees because of an emergency in the absence of a legislative declaration that a financial emergency existed.  </SPAN></P>

The County Legislature rejected the recommendation and its minority members, as permitted by N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 30(1), voted and appointed respondent. The court denied petitioner's application to have respondent's appointment set aside. Section 30(1) was passed to correct a quirk in the election law whereby the members of one party were asked to approve the Commissioners of Election of a second party. Section 30(1) was both governed and authorized by N.Y. Const. art. II, &sect; 8, and the court denied petitioner's application to declare it unconstitutional. The court held that there were no improprieties in the calling and conduct of the meeting. The court held that courts were reluctant to interfere with the internal affairs of an association as long as its procedures did not violate standards of fair dealing and the claimed irregularities did not violate such standards.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The procedures of subdivision 1 of section 30 of the Election Law, under which the minority members of the County Legislature select a Commissioner of Elections, are consistent with the home rule provisions of article IX (&sect; 1, subd [b]) of the State Constitution.  In 1963, article IX was adopted to replace former article X and provided that nonelected county officers would be &quot;appointed by such officers of the local government as may be provided by law&quot;, indicating a wider mandate than the former appointment by &quot;other county authorities as the Legislature shall direct&quot;.  Section 8 of article II provides for equal representation by the largest two political parties on boards and among officers charged with various election duties, creating an exception to local home rule requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner incumbent minority party Election Commissioner has no standing as a nonmember of his party's county committee to object to its procedures, but a member petitioner does have such standing, and the incumbent commissioner has standing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to challenge the section of the Election Law on which his ouster depends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The county committee properly gave notice that there would be &quot;New Business&quot; considered at its meeting, and no more particularized notice was needed that a new Commissioner of Elections would be selected, nor was it more than a mere irregularity that notice was sent to committee members who might be elected rather than those in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Proxies donated for vote on previously unexpressed opinions were valid and were properly included in the counting of a quorum of the party committee, notwithstanding that more than one donee's name appeared on some of the proxies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. It was reasonable and proper for the committee to take a preference vote for nominees for the office of Commissioner of Elections, rather than merely determine the fitness of candidates.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child's mother testified that she lived with the decedent without marrying him. The court found that N.Y. Est.

It held that even though the paternity proceeding was not brought within the first two years of the child's life, the filiation order was effective to legitimatize the child for inheritance purposes based on the decedent's voluntary admission of paternity during his life made in the paternity proceeding. The court found that the admission constituted a waiver of the statute of limitations and a voluntary relinquishment of that defense. The court found that the waiver was binding on the decedent's estate and that the child was, therefore, entitled to share in the estate as a distributee. The court did not reach the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 4-1.2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted by the Grand Jury of Kings County after a prior indictment on the same charges by the Special Narcotics Court of New York City (sitting in New York County) was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court dismissed the indictment. N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 210.20(4) provided that upon dismissing an indictment for the reason that it was defective within the meaning of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 210.25, the order of dismissal constituted a bar to any further prosecution of such charges in any criminal court within the county unless the court authorized the People to resubmit the charges to a Grand Jury. N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 210.25(2) stated that an indictment was defective when the allegations demonstrated the court did not have jurisdiction of the offense charged. The court noted that the Special Narcotics Court of New York City had citywide jurisdiction over cases involving the sale or possession of narcotic drugs in Kings County. Thus, since that court had not authorized a resubmission of the charges against defendant, the indictment was required to be dismissed. The court upheld the constitutionality of N.Y. Pub.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion to dismiss the indictment for failure of the People to procure authorization for resubmission to the Grand Jury, denied the motion to dismiss the indictment by reason of the unconstitutionality of the provisions of the New York Public Health Law, and granted the motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes to the limited extent that the court had examined said minutes in camera.</SPAN></P>

The court issued a judgment in favor of the SSI recipients, and found &sect; 158(a) was unconstitutional in denying them equal protection of the law. The court held that &sect; 158(a), insofar as it barred any individual citizen from asserting his right to public assistance where needed, so that it deprived him of privileges similar to those possessed by his fellow citizens was unconstitutional. The court further held that &sect; 158(a) had violated the SSI recipients' constitutional rights that were established by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution in that, although they were as needy as other recipients of assistance who also had income, the regulation had operated to their financial disadvantage.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision (a) of section 158 of the Social Services Law, insofar as it renders petitioners ineligible to receive State supplemental public assistance solely on the ground that they are recipients of Federal social security income (SSI), is unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause since it deprives petitioners of public assistance available to all other needy recipients of home relief and of petitioners' rights to receive &quot;care and support&quot; under article XVII of the State Constitution.  Public assistance to the aged, blind and disabled is administered by the Social Security Administration.  A basic grant is provided to every aged, blind and disabled person in the country with appropriate provisions authorizing each State to make an additional grant for each SSI recipient so that the Social Security Administration could issue one check for the combined total.  In replacing the need based public assistance grant (Social Services Law, &sect; 131-a) with a flat grant to persons receiving SSI, the State has failed to give due recognition to all of the defined standards of need for recipients&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  who fall into the SSI group.  The statute deprives a special class of citizens of the assurance that, when all other programs fail to meet their needs, other grants would be made available to them for that purpose.  Had the statute in establishing eligibility requirements contained additional provisions for supplementation of inadequate grants up to the subsistence level for all SSI recipients, its validity could not be questioned. The local welfare district is directed to accept applications on an individual basis, from SSI recipients, for public assistance based on home relief standards similar to those available to all other classes of citizens.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent father sought to dismiss petitioner mother's petition on behalf of the couple's two illegitimate children for their support on the grounds that &sect; 516 of the New York Family Court Act, dealing with the support of illegitimate children, provided that the performance of a judicially-approved agreement to support them, which the father had signed, barred any other remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was a physician who cohabited with the mother for 11 years. They resided together as a family with their two sons who were eight and seven years old when the couple separated. Until the separation, the father supported the children and their mother. Upon separation, the father acknowledged paternity of the two boys and signed a support agreement, which agreement was approved by a court. Thereafter, the mother filed the subject petition to increase child support and to provide for college expenses. The court denied the father's motion to dismiss and held that &sect; 516 was unconstitutional under the equal protection guarantee, as applied to illegitimate children whose paternity was clear at the time of the agreement. However, the court declined to rule on the constitutionality of &sect; 516 where the father had not acknowledged paternity of an illegitimate child. The court also entered a support order, increasing the amount of child support to be paid by the father, and held that the illegitimate sons were entitled to be supported in the same standard of living that approximated the father's.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 516 of the Family Court Act, providing that a judicially-approved agreement to support illegitimate children bars any other remedy, unconstitutionally deprives the children of equal protection where paternity is clear, since the support of legitimate children is subject to escalation on the basis of increased need of the children or increased means of the parent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Illegitimacy has not been determined to be a suspect category, but applicable United States Supreme Court cases indicate a requirement that the means taken by a State advance a State purpose unattainable by less discriminatory means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 516 does not advance the State purpose of promoting legitimacy, since it allows a father of an illegitimate child to escape escalating payments otherwise imposable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. While section 516 may supply an incentive to execute support agreements, the benefit thereof is no greater for an illegitimate than a legitimate child where paternity is clear, and the public interest in sufficiency of support should preponderate.</SPAN></P>

Based upon the father's substantial means and the modest request of the mother&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for child support consistent with her standard of living the amount of the support agreement should be modified upwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  Section 513 of the Family Court Act cannot constitutionally be read to require that a part of the burden of child support of an illegitimate child be allocated to the mother, in contrast to sections 413 and 414, which provide for primary support of a minor child by the father.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the recipient of benefits under the Aid to Dependent Children program, brought a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 38 proceeding against respondents, the New York State Department of Social Services and its Commissioner, to (1) annul the decision of the Department sustaining the Commissioner's determination, (2) restore statutory entitlements to the recipient, and (3) declare N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 352.7(g)(5) invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the recipient's request, the county social services department advanced benefits to prevent a shut-off of utilities. Such an advance was authorized by N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 352.7(g)(5). However, the regulation required that the recipient's grant be reduced over the next six months to repay the amount of the advance. The recipient argued that any reduction without a prior agency determination that undue hardship would not result was contrary to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 601 et seq., 45 C.F.R. &sect; 233.20, and N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 352.31(d)(4). The court rejected this contention. The recipient offered no evidence that hardship resulted. Further, the regulation limited the advance allowance to the four-month period immediately preceding the advance and permitted recoupment of the advance over the next six months. This built-in limitation would, in almost all cases, limit a budget reduction to 10 percent or less. Here, the monthly reduction amounted to less than 3 percent of the budget. This reduction was unlikely to result in undue hardship. Moreover, there was no assurance that a denial of recoupment would inure to the benefit of the children involved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner and her five children, recipients of Aid to Dependent Children at a monthly grant of $ 695, were advanced the sum of $ 197.32 to prevent a shut-off of utilities as authorized by 18 NYCRR 357.2(g)(5), which limits the advance allowance to the four-month period immediately preceding the advance payment and permits recoupment of the advance over the next six months.  The reduction in petitioner's monthly budget in accordance with the regulation, without a prior agency determination that it would not result in undue hardship, is not violative of or inconsistent with Federal and State laws and regulations. Petitioner has shown no evidence that hardship resulted, nor has she explained her failure to pay the utility bills with the moneys allocated to her for that purpose.  Moreover, the built-in limitation in the allowance and period of recoupment by its very nature, would, in almost all cases, limit a budget reduction to 10% or less.  Here, it is unlikely that the monthly reduction of less than 3% of the budget could possibly result in undue hardship. And, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  even if there were to be a denial of recoupment, there is no assurance that it would inure to the benefit of the children involved.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother filed three petitions pursuant to N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 171 over a three-year period for upwards modification of the court's prior order of child support against respondent father. The court dismissed two petitions and reviewed the modifications sought on the most recent petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties' child was born out of wedlock. The parties had stipulated to the amount in the prior child support order. The mother asserted that the amount of child support that the child was entitled to should have been governed by the father's standard of living from N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act art. 4, which governed the child support obligations of children born in wedlock. The mother asserted that the distinction between the amount due to legitimate children and natural children violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court noted that parentage was not a suspect classification for equal protection purposes. The court distinguished the mother's proffered case law as improperly based on sin, whereas the distinction between N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act art. 4, 5 were based on a reasonable and rational legislative goal of the preservation of harmony within the custodial family unit. The court was entitled to greater latitude for setting the child support obligations when there was great disparity of the standards of living of the parents. The court held that the child was entitled to less than the parties had stipulated to in the prior order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child denied the mother's petition for modification of the child support order against the father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Children born out of wedlock -- support -- father's standard of living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 513 of the Family Court Act which requires the father of an out-of-wedlock child to pay a &quot;fair and reasonable sum for the support&quot; of such child, does not deny an out-of-wedlock child equal protection of the laws notwithstanding the fact that section 413 of the Family Court Act establishes a different standard of support for a legitimate child requiring the father of such child to pay a &quot;fair and reasonable sum according to his means&quot; for support.  Although the father's standard of living should be given consideration in determining his ability to pay, an out-of-wedlock child is not allowed to receive support determined solely on the father's standard of living. The distinctions between the support awards test of sections 413 and 513 are not &quot;patently arbitrary&quot; or irrationally related to a valid governmental interest. Section 513, unlike section 413, does not make the father primarily responsible for support, but makes both parents jointly and severally liable.  Section 513 provides a reasonable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and rational test to determine support since it is within the best interests of an out-of-wedlock child to be within the relative lifestyle of the members of his household. Fixing support for an out-of-wedlock child solely according to the father's standard of living would tend to cause strife in that child's household where there is a great disparity between the standards of living of the father and mother.  On the other hand, a legitimate child in an article 4 support proceeding has usually lived in a household which included both of his parents.  Thus, the legislative reason for allowing the child to receive support according to his father's standard of living is to maintain that child's standard of living. Otherwise, the child would have to cope with adjusting to another economic standard of living in addition to dealing with the emotional crises that confront a child due to the breakup of his family.  The legislative interest in easing the burdens of a child from a separated family is a valid concern of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner mother is not entitled to an annual increase in the $ 125 weekly support order to meet inflationary trends since there has been no material change&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of circumstances between the parties since the prior support order. Petitioner, her out-of-wedlock child, and her disabled 26-year-old son from a prior marriage, reside as a family in the same house.  Petitioner is unemployed and the family income, other than the support for the child, is the disability payment received by her 26-year-old son from which he contributes $ 25 per week to her for his room and board. Respondent father is only required to contribute one third of the total family shelter bill as the share for the shelter of his son.  Respondent is required to pay for cost of tuition for a private school since the child has responded favorably to private school and respondent has the ability to pay for it.  The sum of $ 100 per year is an adequate amount to be used to defray the cost of medical treatment.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 31, a majority of the Democratic county committee in each county selected a person to be recommended for appointment as a commissioner of elections. In three counties including plaintiffs' county of residence, the chairmen of the county committees selected a person to be recommended pursuant to N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 51. Plaintiffs alleged that N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 51 was unconstitutional because their duly elected county committee members were not able to participate directly in the choosing of the commissioner of elections like committee members throughout the state. The court declined to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint solely on the ground of standing. The court concluded that N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 51 was presumptively valid and that it could not set aside the statute as unconstitutional unless that conclusion was inescapable. The court declared that &sect; 51 was constitutional, finding that plaintiffs had ample means to bring pressure to bear on the county chairman to conform to the wishes of the majority of the county committee members.

The court found that the city exercised proper discretion in continuing to impose and collect the tax. The court found that in prior cases the appellate division had found that city administrations, which had relied on the taxing authority granted to it to prepare its budgets, and which had collected taxes under that power, could not be forced to refund amounts later determined to have been illegally collected due to the impossible burden that it would cause. The court found that the city had not acted in bad faith and that no one could have predicted the result of the case on which the taxpayer had relied.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff's action to declare section 90 of the Judiciary Law&nbsp;unconstitutional is not barred by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, based upon a Federal three-Judge court decision dismissing his complaint for like relief, since such dismissal was not on the merits, where one Judge urged abstention, the second urged dismissal on the merits and the third dissented.  United States Supreme Court affirmance of the decision does not indicate that the decision was on the merits, since the latter decision implied that it was upholding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the lower court's dismissal, based upon the impropriety of Federal court interference in a State attorney disciplinary matter. Accordingly, neither the Federal nor State constitutional issues were reached, and they may now be raised in State court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff did not waive his right to raise the constitutional issues arising out of the disciplinary proceedings against him by failure to timely raise such issues, since it appears that he unsuccessfully sought review thereof before the Appellate Division and Court of Appeals, and the issue of deprivation of the right to appeal could not have been raised until his application for appeal were denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The quasi-criminal nature of attorney disciplinary proceedings does not mandate that an attorney be granted procedural rights identical to those of criminal defendants.  Accordingly, it was not improper for the Appellate Division to act as Grand Jury, prosecutor, Judge and jury, nor for that court to appoint a referee, and plaintiff was not deprived of due process by denial of any right to present his oral argument and summation before the trier of facts instead of the referee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The failure to accord plaintiff an appeal does not deprive him of due process or equal protection, since there is no constitutional right to appeal where due process has been accorded in the trial court, and equal protection does not require an appeal, absent a showing that there is no reasonable basis for treating attorney disciplinary proceedings differently from other professional disciplinary proceedings.  The relationship between courts and lawyers justifies the vesting of original jurisdiction in the courts instead of an administrative agency, affording the attorney an initial determination by the body which would otherwise conduct a review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant hotel was charged with three violations of Village of Larchmont, N.Y., Rev. Gen. Ordinances &sect; 2201, which required all hotels and clubhouses in the village to have a night watchman. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance. It also claimed that enforcement of the ordinance without a search warrant was unconstitutional and that the prosecution had not sustained its burden of proving the three violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended the prosecution was insufficient in that there was no proof that the hotel was occupied at the time of the alleged violations. The court rejected this contention. A reading of the ordinance clearly showed that occupation was not an element of the offense of having no night watchman. The court also rejected the contention that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The ordinance required that the watchman visit every portion of the building at frequent regular intervals, but in any case not less frequently than hourly. This was a precise standard of conduct that could reasonably be complied with by the property owner. The court rejected the contention that the ordinance was discriminatory, and thus a violation of equal protection, because of its separate classification for hotels and clubhouses. Hotels and clubhouses were open to the public. They had large kitchens. The danger of fire and other hazards was more likely in such accommodations. These facts justified the separate classification. Finally, no search warrant was required because the police officers only entered the public portions of the hotel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The only hotel in a village is found guilty of violating a village ordinance which requires all hotels and clubhouses located within the village to employ a watchman to visit every portion of the building between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., not less frequently than hourly, for the purpose of detecting fire or other sources of danger and giving immediate and timely warning thereof to all occupants. The ordinance is not unconstitutionally vague, but sets forth a standard of conduct which can be reasonably complied with, and, in view of the nature of hotel and clubhouse facilities, and the hazards and dangers inherent therein, has a reasonable basis and is not discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Occupation of the premises is not an element of the offense set forth in the ordinance. Accordingly, lack of proof that the hotel premises were, in fact, occupied at the time of the alleged violation is no impediment to prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Police officers had entered public portions of the hotel premises and remained there at least one hour without observing a night watchman. The officers did no more than any ordinary member of the public&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was permitted to do under the circumstances, and their conduct did not require a search warrant. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer submitted to the County a proposed subdivision map. The County directed the developer to install lateral sewer lines in the streets located within the plot, to make a cash contribution for the future construction of a sewage treatment plant, and to make another cash contribution in lieu of the sewer line installation along the public roads running along the developer's plot. The developer filed an action seeking an order directing the County to approve the subdivision map without requiring the developer to pay cash in lieu of the public roads' sewer lines. The developer also sought an order declaring N.Y. Town Law &sect; 277(5)(d), upon which the County made its decision, unconstitutional. The court found that the County was charged with the systematic regulation of its sewer systems, that there was no evidence that the County's mode of calculating the assessment made against the developer was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion, and that the developer failed to show that &sect; 277(5)(d) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed an application pro se for a writ of habeas corpus. Petitioner framed his application on the ground that his detention was illegal in violation of his constitutional rights. Petitioner contended that a revised penal law was enacted pursuant to an unauthorized delegation of legislative authority to the State Commission on the Revision of the Penal Law and Criminal Code. The court found the Commission merely proposed legislation to the Legislature; it did not enact the new law. Therefore, the Legislature did not delegate its legislative authority to the Commission, and as a result, the revised Penal Law of 1965, as proposed by the commission and enacted by the Legislature, survived petitioner's constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner was indicted and convicted of criminal possession and sale of narcotics, criminal possession of a hypodermic needle and criminal possession of a defaced revolver. An appeal is still pending.

The commission merely proposed legislation to the Legislature, it did not enact the new law. Therefore, the Legislature did not delegate its legislative authority to the commission, and as a result, the revised Penal Law survives petitioner's challenge.  Moreover, as documentary proof negates defendant's contention of an unauthorized delegation of authority, petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus can be denied on that ground without a hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Further, the pendency of petitioner's direct appeal from the judgment of conviction makes the granting of the petition in this proceeding improper.  The law is well settled in this State that habeas corpus is not available as a substitute for the normal process of appeal.  </SPAN></P>

The history of the legislation that made N.Y. Envtl. Conserv.

The court held that &sect; 9-0305 did not violate state and federal constitutional prohibitions on the taking of property without just compensation. The statute had a valid objective under the police power, the means employed were reasonably related to this objective, and it was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or oppressive. The statute did not violate the First Amendment guarantee of free speech because its restrictions were justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, they served a significant government interest, and there were alternative channels for communication of the information.

The First Amendment does not preclude the State from adopting reasonable measures to control the &quot;ugliness, distraction and deterioration&quot; which can result from the erection of advertising signs and billboards. The regulation is intended to serve the important governmental interest implicit in the exercise of the police power, and there are ample other alternative channels for communication of the information available in the affected area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  ECL 9-0305 does not require the payment of compensation for the removal of advertising signs for which compensation would otherwise be required by section 88 of the Highway Law, which was enacted to implement the Federal Highway Beautification Act (L 1968, ch 581, &sect; 1).  The majority of plaintiff's signs are located within 660 feet of Federally-aided primary highways running through the Catskill Park. Section 88 provides for the payment of compensation for the taking of such pre-existing advertising signs.  However, the subsequent enactment of ECL 9-0305 shows a clear legislative intent to provide an amortization period&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as an alternate to the payment of compensation for pre-existing advertising signs in the Catskill Park.  </SPAN></P>

Law &sect;&sect; 756, 757, 770, 772, 774, 775, statutory provisions for supplementary proceedings to collect money judgments, because the laws were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment debtor was detained, arrested, incarcerated, and confined in penal institutions under the supplementary proceedings to collect money judgments, N.Y. Jud. Law &sect;&sect; 756, 757, 770, 772, 774, 775. The same laws earlier had been found unconstitutional in a federal district court and the injunction against their enforcement was stayed by the United States Supreme Court pending appeal. The judgment debtor claimed damages from the state and a sheriff for the promulgation and enforcement of unconstitutional laws to which he was subjected. The state filed a motion to dismiss, which the court granted, and also sua sponte dismissed the sheriff from the action. The court held that even if the laws were unconstitutional, there was no cause of action against a state for the exercise of its sovereign function that could not be likened to functions that could be carried on by a private person or corporation. The state had only waived its immunity for its acts that could be carried on by private entities. The sheriff was not a state officer and could not be liable for the state's actions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Claimant has no cause of action against defendant State of New York based upon his three-month incarceration and confinement in a criminal penal institution for alimony arrears (Judiciary Law, &sect;&sect; 756, 757, 770, 772-775).  Even if the statutes pursuant to which claimant was arrested and confined in jail were unconstitutional, the State cannot in any event be held liable for the enactment of statutes which are later declared unconstitutional. The waiver of immunity by the State (Court of Claims Act, &sect; 8) is inapplicable where the activity complained of is sovereign in character and cannot be likened to functions which could be carried on by a private person or corporation.  Since the legislative acts attacked were sovereign in character, the claim must be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court allowed the Commissioner's claim. N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 24 was applicable to the case. That statute was not unconstitutional. There was no waiver of the claim.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants, charged with receiving unlawful gratuities while they were Suffolk County officials, a class A misdemeanor (Penal Law, &sect; 200.35), were not unconstitutionally denied a speedy trial by reason of a six-month delay in bringing the case to trial.  After defendants were indicted, the Special Prosecutor appointed by the Attorney-General, pursuant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to his authority to investigate &quot;any and all unlawful acts or omissions&quot; of members or employees of the District Attorney's office, commenced an investigation into whether any improper influence was brought to bear upon members of the District Attorney's staff to prevent the indictment of defendants on felony charges.  The Special Prosecutor issued subpoenas and questioned witnesses before an Extraordinary Special Grand Jury.  He requested that the case against defendants &quot;be held in abeyance&quot; until the files in the case were reviewed.  The six-month delay caused by the interest and activities of the Special Prosecutor was a justified delay occasioned by &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; ( CPL 30.30, subd [4], par [g]).  Any precipitous action by the District Attorney might have been construed as an attempt to thwart the ongoing investigation.  There is no proof that defendants' ability to defend themselves was prejudiced.</SPAN></P>

While CPL 440.40 grants leave to the People to move to set aside the sentence on the ground that it was invalid as a matter of law, it does not authorize the setting aside of the youthful offender adjudication.  The adjudication and the sentence involve separate component parts of the judgment and are not synonymous.  The People should have moved to vacate the sentence of probation as not being authorized by law instead of focusing the entire thrust of their attack upon setting aside the adjudication of youthful offender on the principal ground that subsequent decisions should be given retroactive application. In any event, the appellate decision upholding the constitutionality of CPL 720.10 should not be given retroactive effect in light of that court's statement that &quot;the issue remains open&quot; and should be appealed to Court of Appeals for an authoritative ruling.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being arrested in and adjacent to a hotel, four women were convicted of prostitution, and a hotel clerk was convicted of permitting prostitution. Pursuant to N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect;&sect; 2320, 2324, the State brought an action against defendants, claiming defendants were guilty of maintaining a nuisance and seeking permanent injunctive relief. In granting the injunction, the court held that pursuant to N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2324, the convictions and the community's reputation were presumptive evidence of the nuisance and prima facie evidence of defendants' knowledge, acquiescence, and participation. The court also held that it did not matter whether the clerk was on the hotel's payroll or not because &sect; 2324 applied to &quot;any person&quot; found guilty of permitting prostitution.</SPAN></P>
