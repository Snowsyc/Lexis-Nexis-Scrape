The trial court awarded judgment in favor of plaintiffs in their medical malpractice action and entered judgment against two doctors and the compensation fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A woman who received breast implants repeatedly complained to her plastic surgeon of discomfort in her right breast. The plastic surgeon told her that a hardening in the breast was a common result of augmentation surgery and did not send the patient for diagnostic tests. The woman also complained to her obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYN), who told her she should follow up with her plastic surgeon. When other doctors diagnosed breast cancer, the patient and her husband filed a medical malpractice action against her plastic surgeon and her OB/GYN. The trial court entered judgment for plaintiffs. The court affirmed. The jury did not commit manifest error in finding that the plastic surgeon was negligent in his treatment by not ordering a mammogram and that his negligence proximately damaged the patient; a medical review panel found that the surgeon failed to comply with the proper standard of care. The trial court did not err in awarding damages to plaintiffs under a cap for each doctor, rather than a cap for plaintiffs' total award. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.42(B) permitted the application of separate caps to each separate act of negligence by each liable health care provider.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of plaintiffs in their medical malpractice action, and the court affirmed the judgment that the statutory cap was applicable to each doctor and his negligence, rather than to plaintiffs' total recovery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged their conviction for attempted illegal use of a weapon by discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle on public highway and their sentences. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that one of the defendants was not entitled to a new trial because while there were discrepancies in the officer's testimony regarding the driver of the vehicle, the jury clearly decided that the officer's testimony was credible and decided to reject the discrepancies. Next, the court held that the ten year sentence was not excessive. Although the sentence imposed was greater than the maximum sentence for the alleged act, the trial court had discretion to deviate where the record supported the deviation and the specified aggravating or mitigating circumstances justified the departure. The court noted that the defendants opened fire on women and a baby and that such actions were deplorable and mandated a stiff sentence from the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), that convicted her of aggravated battery and criminal conspiracy, arguing that the district court erred in permitting the State to introduce the recorded statements of a key witness into evidence in violation of the rule against hearsay and that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the victim broke up with her boyfriend, he contacted his sister, the defendant, and expressed a desire that someone throw acid in the victim's face. The victim procured the assistance of two acquaintances and participated in mixing up the liquid. The defendant was subsequently charged with and convicted of aggravated battery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34 and criminal conspiracy in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:26. The defendant appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that the recorded statement of a key witness, one of the attackers, was properly used to impeach her where she evaded questions by claiming that she did not recall the prior statement made to police. The statement was thus properly admitted under La. Evid. Code Ann. art. 607 to impeach the witness's claims at trial that the defendant was not involved in the attack. Further, where the evidence included the defendant's admission of her involvement to a fellow inmate and the testimony of the attackers regarding the defendant's involvement, the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was injured in a diving accident and brought suit against defendants. The trial court found that plaintiff suffered general damages of $ 3,500,000. His parents were awarded damages for loss of consortium.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5106, which set a cap on damage awards against the state and its political subdivisions. The parent's loss of consortium claims were dismissed because plaintiff's general damages exhausted the monetary limits of the cap on damages. After The supreme court granted the plaintiff a writ, and remanded to the appellate court to reconsider the award of total damages on account of a supreme court decision declaring the cap in &sect; 13:5106&nbsp;unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee sought review of a judgment from the 21st Judicial District Court, Division F, Parish of Tangipahoa (Louisiana), which affirmed action taken by a municipal civil service board (board) in which the board failed to grant any relief to the employee with respect to his complaint of a discriminatory implementation of defendant city's pay classification plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a city police officer, complained that a new pay classification plan implemented by the city was discriminatory and unconstitutional because it did not provide uniform pay to persons who had the same pay grade code. The employee filed a complaint with the board concerning the discriminatory implementation of the pay classification plan. The board's action failed to grant any relief to the employee. The trial court then affirmed the board's action. On appeal, the court vacated the trial court's judgment and dismissed the employee's claim to the board. The court found that the employee's complaint did not pertain to a discharge or any corrective or disciplinary action, which were the only grounds that afforded him the appeal procedure to the board provided by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2501(A). The court determined that &sect; 33:2501(A) did not apply in this case. The court ruled that the board was without legal authority to entertain the employee's complaint or to render any decision with respect to the employee's allegations of unconstitutional discrimination. The court found that the board was not the proper forum for the employee to raise his constitutional issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of the trial court that affirmed the board's action. The court dismissed the employee's claim to the board.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the Second Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bienville (Louisiana) convicting him of distribution of cocaine, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(A)(1). He was sentenced to serve 150 months at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a conviction of distribution of cocaine, the court affirmed, holding that the record contained sufficient evidence upon which to base defendant's conviction. The court held that statutes were presumed to be valid, and the constitutionality of a statute should be upheld whenever possible. The facts in the instant case did not involve an extension of state criminal authority beyond the proper reach of government into a constitutionally protected area of defendant's life. Accordingly, the court did not reach the question of whether either La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:967(A)(1) or 40:961(13) were unconstitutionally broad in its scope. Further, where a statute was ambiguous and susceptible of two constructions, courts should give that construction which best comported with the principles of reason, justice, and convenience. Defendant's construction of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:961(13) was incorrect. Further, the language of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:961(13) and 40:967(A) made it sufficiently clear that selling $ 20 rocks of crack cocaine on the street to the general public was unlawful. Such conduct was not authorized by the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, holding that the evidence, when viewed in a light favorable to the prosecution, was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of distribution of cocaine. Accordingly, defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband began receiving military retirement benefits in 1978. In 1982, the parties were legally separated and they subsequently entered into a community property settlement, which did not mention the retirement benefits. At the time, case law provided that such benefits were separate property. In 1992, the wife filed a petition to partition the retirement benefits and sought retroactive application of 10 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1408(c)(1), which overruled existing case law on the subject of military retirement benefits. The trial court denied the petition and ruled that the retroactive application was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and held that Congress intended that the statute be applied retroactively. The court further found that retroactive application did not deprive the husband of vested substantive rights. The court noted that until the decision that held that the benefits were separate property, the parties must have reasonably expected that the pension would have been treated as community property. The court further determined that because the divorce settlement did not address the retirement benefits, the wife's right to the benefits had been preserved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment entered in favor of the former husband and held that the military retirement benefits were community property. The trial court remanded the case to the trial court for a calculation of the former wife's share of benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development appealed from the judgment of the 40th Judicial District Court, Parish of St. John the Baptist (Louisiana) awarding damages in the personal injury action brought by the provisional tutor of decedent's infant against defendants, the driver of the vehicle in which decedent was riding, the driver's insurance company, the state, and the Department. The Department was found liable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was riding in a vehicle, driven by one of the defendants, on a highway when the vehicle flipped out of control. The decedent died as a result of her injuries. While the driver's blood alcohol level was found to be .05, the state police trooper who investigated the accident did not cite her. Eyewitnesses on the scene soon after the accident all testified that they saw the condition of the highway and that there was no reconstruction going on or any obstacle in the road. It was alleged that the accident was caused by a defect due to the Department's improper testing procedures of materials used in the reconstruction of the highway. The court affirmed the judgment below awarding damages against the Department. The court found that the Department violated its own testing procedures thereby causing the material to be defective, and that such defect created an unreasonably dangerous condition. Further, where the Department was responsible for maintaining the highways and knew it did not follow the proper procedures, the court found there was constructive knowledge of the defect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment awarding damages against the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development in the personal injury suit against it and others brought by the provisional tutor of the infant of the decedent, who died in the single-car accident. The matter was remanded so that an increased damage award could be assessed against the Department.</SPAN></P>

Second, the court held the trial court did not err in denying defendant's challenge for cause as to one juror because the juror's acquaintance with some of the officers did not render him ineligible where the juror had been disassociated from his employment at the sheriff's office and expressed his ability to render a fair and impartial judgment and to hold the state to its burden of proof.

The trial court vacated and set aside defendant's sentence and sentenced him as a second offender to seven years at hard labor under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. The State contended that defendant's seven year sentence was illegal because it was below the statutory minimum sentence of ten years at hard labor under the habitual offender law. The supreme court remanded to the court to determine if defendant's original sentence was unconstitutionally excessive. The court held that, given the presumption that a sentence under the habitual offender law was constitutional, and considering that defendant was eligible for parole, the minimum sentence mandated by the legislature was not grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime. The court held that the trial court erred in finding that the enhanced sentence was excessive, and in reducing defendant's sentence below the minimum of ten years at hard labor without credit for good time mandated under La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant struck a car while driving and killed three people. Defendant was charged and convicted of three counts of vehicular homicide, and appealed his conviction. The court held that the evidence was legally sufficient for the jury to find that defendant was the driver of his vehicle at the time of the accident, because his passenger did not know how to operate a truck, and physical evidence indicated that defendant was the driver. The court also determined that it was error for a prosecution witness, the accident investigator, to testify that in his opinion defendant was the driver of the truck that struck the victim's, because under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 704, the expert witness was prohibited from giving an opinion on the ultimate issue. However, the court stated that the evidence was harmless, because defendant's guilt was overwhelming. Finally, the court concluded that defendant's sentence of 10 years imprisonment on each count was not unconstitutionally excessive, because the circumstances did not warrant a less onerous sentencing alternative.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81.2. Defendant was sentenced to pay a fine and to serve a 48-month term of imprisonment at hard labor.

Defendant, the victim's stepfather, contended that the trial court erred by finding him guilty on the basis of insufficient evidence. The court held that the testimony of the victim alone was sufficient to prove the elements of an offense. The fact that the trial court found defendant guilty indicated that the trial court accepted the victim's testimony and rejected defendant's testimony insofar as he denied committing the offense. On appeal, the appellate court would not assess the credibility of witnesses to overturn a fact finder's determination of guilt. The court found that the evidence proved all of the elements of molestation of a juvenile and defendant's identity as perpetrator. Also, in evaluating whether newly discovered evidence warranted a new trial, the test was whether the new evidence was so material that it ought to produce a verdict different from that rendered at trial. The court rejected defendant's contention that the district court allowed the prosecution to make improper remarks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The engineers employed by the City filed suit to obtain upward pay adjustments comparable to those received by six other engineers employed by the City. The engineers contended that the Civil Service Board Rule IV, Sec. 1.7, pertaining to incumbent salary realignment, was unconstitutional. The City countered that the engineers did not receive a pay adjustment, because they were either in a different classification or they lacked the requisite educational background and work experience. All parties filed motions for summary judgment, and the trial court ruled in favor of the City and the other defendants. On review, the court held that the suit had to be remanded for joinder and re-trial because the engineers failed to join the Attorney General as an indispensable party. According to the court, the Attorney General was an indispensable party because the civil service rule was alleged to be unconstitutional. The court also noted that only certain engineers in the same pay class would have standing to bring the suit.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 14:94, defendant appealed and asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motion for mistrial pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 775(3) because, during his trial, the prosecutor threatened to file a bill of information charging one of the defense witnesses with perjury. The appellate court held that defendant failed to demonstrate that he suffered any prejudice precluding a fair trial because of the prosecutor's conduct. Defendant also contended that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction and that the trial court erred by denying his motion for a post-verdict judgment of acquittal. The court held that the assignment of error lacked merit because, when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence demonstrates that defendant fired a gun at an occupied car. Finally, defendant argued that the sentence imposed was unconstitutional. The court held that defendant failed to sustain his burden on the issue and affirmed both the conviction and the sentence.</SPAN></P>

After denying defendant's motion for a new trial, the court sentenced defendant to 20 years at hard labor for the attempted aggravated rape of his stepdaughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a conviction of attempted aggravated rape, the court held that the elements which the prosecution must prove in a prosecution for aggravated rape of a child under 12 were (1) anal or vaginal penetration deemed to be without consent of the victim because of (2) the victim's age at the time of the rape. The jury could have found that the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was under the age of 12 at the time of defendant's sexual intercourse. Further, the court found no error in the trial court's failure to instruct the jury as defendant requested. Defendant's proposed instruction did not meet the requirements of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 807. Also, other sex crimes against the same victim were admissible in a prosecution for aggravated rape. The court held that a sentence imposed within statutory limits would not be deemed excessive in the absence of manifest abuse of discretion. The sentencing court had ample grounds for an upward departure from the guidelines grid range and correctly characterized that the case called for a greater sentence than that shown in the Louisiana Felony Sentencing Guidelines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction entered in the Ninth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Rapides (Louisiana), which accepted defendant's guilty plea to a reduced charge of attempted aggravated rape and sentenced him to 15 years at hard labor, subject to defendant's right to review the denial of his motion to introduce evidence of the victim's prior sexual activity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for aggravated rape. He pled guilty to the reduced charge of attempted aggravated rape and was sentenced to 15 years at hard labor and also ordered to submit to a psychological evaluation. Prior to pleading guilty to the reduced charge and before sentencing, defendant filed a motion to introduce prior sexual activity. After its denial, defendant entered a plea, reserving his right to review the denial of his motion to introduce prior sexual activity. Defendant attempted to argue that the medical records from a certain hospital established that the victim already had inappropriate knowledge of certain sexual activities and that the victim's knowledge and the alleged sexual abuse was possibly a result of the victim's biological father or uncle molesting her, and not defendant. The court found that defendant's motion was properly denied based on relevancy, because the timing of the victim's hospitalization and the timing of defendant becoming a member of her family raised the probability that it was defendant who committed these crimes upon the victim. The court upheld defendant's conviction, but amended his sentence to allow him credit for time served.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for attempted aggravated rape. However, the court amended defendant's sentence to allow credit for time served. The case was remanded to the trial court to amend the commitment and minute entry of the sentence to reflect that defendant was given credit for time served and to inform defendant of the prescriptive period for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On an application for writ of certiorari from the 14th Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu, State of Louisiana, defendant raised multiple claims of error related to pre-trial rulings in his capital murder trial which included a challenge to the finding of validity of the parole violation warrant used to arrest him, and a challenge to a ruling on the limitation on evidence of diminished capacity under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 651.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On defendant's writ application, the court determined that the Georgia parole violation warrant on which the Louisiana authorities relied to arrest defendant was not stale, and its execution was not unreasonably delayed. Defendant's whereabouts were not known for all but a total of three months from the time the warrant was issued until his arrest. The actions of the Georgia authorities, initiating the process for transfer of parole supervision to Louisiana, did not vitiate the warrant or establish a waiver of Georgia's right to enforce it. Until the transfer of parole supervision was completed, Georgia retained authority to execute the warrant. Therefore, there is no error in the trial court's ruling that the parole violation warrant was valid. Also, because the defense of diminished capacity was not recognized in Louisiana, defendant could not introduce evidence of a mental condition or defect which rendered him incapable of forming specific intent to commit a crime, unless he entered a dual plea of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. Art. 651. Therefore, defendant's motion to quash was properly denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's request for a stay of the capital murder proceedings was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defense counsel did not file a contemporaneous objection, so the issue of the constitutionality of the charge on the definition of &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; was not preserved for appeal. Because counsel's failure to object to the charge in this case occurred prior to Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U.S. 39, 111 S.Ct. 328, 112 L.Ed.2d 339 (1990), the failure to object could not have been deficient. The court held that there was sufficient testimony for the jury to conclude that the victim was not armed and defendant did not reasonably believe he was in imminent danger of losing his life or receiving great bodily harm. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational factfinder could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant did not act in self-defense. The court concluded that a rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, could have found that the mitigating factors of &quot;heat of blood&quot; and &quot;sudden passion&quot; were not established by a preponderance of the evidence, and the jury could have found that the defendant had the specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowner requested a zoning variance. The Board of Adjustment granted the request. The civic association filed suit pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:4727E(1) requesting judicial review of the Board's decision. The homeowner filed a dilatory exception pleading the objection of pleading nonconformity with La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 891. The city filed a similar dilatory exception and later filed peremptory exceptions pleading the objections of peremption and no right of action. The civic association filed an amended petition. The trial court sustained the exception of no cause of action based on peremption and overruled all other exceptions as moot. On appeal the court found that because the only difference between the original petition and the amended petition was that the latter added the verification required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:4727E(1), the trial court should have allowed the amended petition to relate back to the date of filing of the original petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant tax purchasers and their buyers appealed from the summary judgment of the Ninth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Rapides (Louisiana) annulling the purchase of certain land at a tax sale and setting aside the subsequent conveyance of the land by the tax purchasers to their buyers, whose exception of prescription was overruled. Plaintiff successors in title to the land had filed the petition to annul such tax sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyers of the subject land from the tax purchasers urged that the five-year period in which to file a petition to annul a tax sale had expired, and argued that the judgment below for the petitioners, the successors in title to such land, was error. The mortgagees of the land had conveyed it to the successors in title after the mortgagees had reacquired the land from the mortgagors, the original grantees, in a bankruptcy proceeding. However, unbeknownst to the mortgagors and mortgagees, the land previously had been sold in a tax sale, due to the mortgagors' unpaid tax debt, and then sold to the buyers. Yet the mortgagors remained in continuous corporeal possession of the land. The court, inter alia, affirmed the judgment and held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2180 required notice to tax debtors of tax delinquency and a pending tax sale and that the tax sale therefore was a nullity where the mortgagors, as tax debtors, received no notice thereof. Further, the petition to annul the tax sale had not prescribed, as the five-year period in which to annul a tax sale either did not commence or had been interrupted by the mortgagors' continuous corporeal possession of the land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended and affirmed the summary judgment annulling the tax purchasers' acquisition of the property in question and setting aside their subsequent conveyance of the property. The judgment was amended to require the successors in title to such property to pay the purchase price, inter alia, to the buyers to whom the subject property had been conveyed by the tax purchasers.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:281.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:281. The trial court found that several passages did violate the law and ordered them struck. After the decision, the president of the school board commented adversely about the trial judge's ruling, and the board's method of implementing the trial court order was not totally effective. The trial court therefore found the board and the president in contempt. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the trial court did not use an improper standard of review to evaluate the curricula. The trial court's findings that the statements regarding morals and sex violated the statute was not clearly wrong. The court replaced passages suggesting that students abstain from homosexual acts. The court affirmed the trial court's enjoining of statements concerning AIDS as factually inaccurate. The board's contempt citation was reversed because they only acted negligently. The board president's contempt conviction was reversed because even if she intended to show disrespect for the court, her speech was constitutionally protected.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the exception. The parents argued that the statute was unconstitutional since their daughter had been judicially separated from her husband for over four years, and her husband had not suffered any damages as a result of her death. The court affirmed the dismissal and held that, although they were separated, the decedent left a surviving spouse within the meaning of art. 2315. The court held that art. 2315 should be strictly construed and did not authorize the parents, as members of a secondary class of beneficiaries, to proceed even if the husband, primary beneficiary, renounced his rights. The court further held that the issue of the constitutionality of the statute was not properly raised in the trial court and would not be considered on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The amendment redefined &quot;domicile&quot; and provided that the only employees exempted from the domicile requirement were those employees who were hired prior to a certain date and they were denied promotional opportunities. The trial court upheld the amendment. The court reversed and rendered judgment that the amended ordinance, which denied promotional opportunities to certain employees was unconstitutional and violated the due process and equal protection articles of Louisiana's constitution. The court held that the attempt to permanently bar promotional opportunities to certain incumbent classified civil service employees destroyed the competitive promotional system based on merit and infringed upon the civil service commission's express and exclusive powers to adopt rules regulating promotion and establishing a general system of promotion pursuant to La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to crime against nature by solicitation. When she appeared for sentencing, the State filed a multiple bill charging her with two prior felony convictions entered on the same date.

In affirming the decision, the court held that a lesser sentence than the minimum under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 could be imposed, and the trial judge was entitled to find the imposition of the minimum sentence under &sect; 15:529.1 was excessive. The fact that the trial judge found the whole concept--that consensual sex for hire was a crime--to be repugnant did not mean that he found the crime or the penalty itself to be unconstitutional. The reasons given for the imposition of less than the minimum sentence were sufficient to support the decision to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The students sought the award of their high school diplomas and a declaration as to the invalidity of the board of education's GEE policy. The trial court held that the GEE had been unconstitutionally administered in violation of the equal protection clause of the federal and state constitutions. The court held that the board of education had authority to establish the GEE as a requirement for obtaining a state diploma and that the trial court erred in holding that the GEE was being administered in violation of the equal protection clause. Under constitutional proscriptions, the board of education could not dictate the curriculum or set exit exam requirements in non-public schools; to do so would be an &quot;excessive entanglement&quot; violative of U.S. Const. amend. I. The state could impose an exit exam requirement on students without violating equal protection provided the exam was specifically tied to the curriculum. The court held that the GEE did not violate the equal protection clause because its administration was rationally related to the state's legitimate interest of insuring minimum competency among persons obtaining a state diploma.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to armed robbery and was sentenced as an habitual offender to 49 1/2 years imprisonment. On appeal, defendant argued that the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, was an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers provided for in La. Const. art. 2, &sect; 2, because the legislature usurped the courts' sentencing discretion. The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's sentence. By imposing certain habitual offender statutes and corresponding penalties, the Legislature merely established a procedure which enabled a district attorney to seek and the courts to exact more severe sentences on defendants who repeatedly violated the criminal laws. The legislature acted within its constitutional authority which allowed it to determine and define a crime and provide its penalty. It did not delegate any of its duties to the judicial or executive branches, nor did it usurp the judiciary's discretion in sentencing a defendant. Accordingly, no separation of powers violation existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's Paymaster Profit Systems/Multi-Fax plan operated by allowing an individual to purchase an informational kit from a success consultant or sponsor for $ 179. Defendant would receive $ 79.00 and the sponsor would receive $ 100. The $ 100.00 payment placed the individual at the bottom of a payment chain. To maintain a place in the chain, an individual had to pay up-line sponsors a total of $ 1,000.00 per month. To receive money, the individual would have to line up new sales of the informational kit. The court affirmed the injunction. The court concluded that the trial court's determination that the Paymaster plan was an illegal pyramid scheme because it was a chain distributor system and therefore in violation of the Unfair Trade Practices Act was correct. Defendant's contention that he was not connected with the scheme was false as he maintained the program, referred to the program as his and admitted a direct financial interest in perpetuating the scheme. The purpose of the licensing statutes that defendant avoided was to protect the public from fraudulent conduct on the part of those operating endless chain businesses and was a valid exercise of state police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee challenged the ruling of the office of workers' compensation administration that denied and dismissed his claim for workers' compensation benefits. The office found that the employee's heart attack was not work-related under &sect; 23:1021(7)(3). The court affirmed and found that the employee asserted that &sect; 23:1021(7)(3) was constitutionally vague. The employee argued that he was required to prove that his physical stress that allegedly caused his heart attack was greater than that of the &quot;average worker.&quot; The court held that although the term &quot;average worker&quot; was not defined, there was nothing in the language of the statute that was so vague as to have deprived the employee of his due process rights. The court noted that the term took its literal meaning from the dictionary, and that the meaning of the term was clear and unambiguous. The court rejected the employee's equal protection claim, and held that a rational distinction existed for the employee's burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence that his heart attack was work-related, and the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence that other workers had to meet for other work-related injuries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Department of Public Safety and Corrections (DPS) sought review of the judgment of the 19th Judicial District Court (Louisiana), which found it solely at fault in breaching its duty under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:403.2 in its licensing of decedent driver with multiple sclerosis, resulting in damages to plaintiffs, a passenger and survivors of accident victims, when the driver allegedly failed to react to an emergency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a car switched lanes in front of his car, the driver swerved across the medial strip and collided head on with another vehicle, killing himself and a married couple and injuring a passenger. Pretrial settlements in the various ensuing suits eliminated several defendants, leaving only the DPS and the driver's liability insurer. On appeal from the adverse judgment, the DPS argued that the trial court erred in finding it liable and failing to find the driver liable. In reversing in part, the court ruled that, in issuing and renewing his operator's license, the DPS breached its duty under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:403.2 to obtain a detailed medical report on the driver and to adopt procedures for protecting the public from the risk presented by his potentially dangerous physical disability. The court held that state immunity did not arise under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2798.1 because no policy decision was involved. The court also ruled that the driver had a duty to refrain from driving if he were physically impaired, even if he were mistakenly licensed by the state, and that the failure to allocate 50 percent fault to him was error. The court affirmed the quantum of damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's finding of no liability of the deceased driver, amended the judgment to reduce the recovery against DPS to reflect the 50 percent fault allocated to the driver, and rendered judgment against the driver's liability insurer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the state's video gaming division, appealed from a decision of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, East Baton Rouge Parish (Louisiana), which declared La. Admin. Code tit. 55, &sect; 4215(A)(1)(e)(iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) to be invalid and unconstitutional, permanently enjoined future enforcement of the provisions and ordered issuance of a Type V video poker license to plaintiff, a truck stop operator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The video gaming division denied the truck stop operator a video gaming license on the basis of La. Admin. Code tit. 55, &sect; 4215(A)(1)(e)(iii), which provided that no truck stop facility constructed after September 6, 1991, would be allowed to apply for a license for a period of two years. The court affirmed the finding of invalidity, the permanent injunction against enforcement of the rules, and the issuance of the license to the operator. The court determined that the matter was properly before it in a judicial proceeding to review the validity of an agency rule under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:963 because the operator made a prior request for agency review and no remedy would have resulted from a contested adjudicated case. The administrative provisions establishing the two-year rule were invalid because the state police exceeded the authority given it by the legislature in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:4862.6A. The state police were not allowed to add the additional two-year qualification. The mandatory injunction was appropriate to enforce the declaratory judgment because the parties stipulated that the only reason for denying the license was the invalid two-year rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's determination that administrative code provisions were invalid, but reversed the determination of unconstitutionality as unnecessary and inappropriate, and affirmed the injunction prohibiting enforcement of the invalid rules and the mandatory injunction granting the truck stop operator a license.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 23:1225(C)(1)(b) to a set-off for old age benefits by the claimant when the claimant received those benefits before becoming employed by the employer and the employer did not contribute anything to the claimant's social security old age account.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retired claimant received old age Social Security benefits that had been equally funded by his contributions and those of his previous employer when the employer hired him. The claimant was injured while working for the employer and sought workers' compensation benefits. The court affirmed the determination that under La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23:1225C(1)(b) the employer could reduce the claimant's workers' compensation benefits due to the claimant's receipt of Social Security old-age benefits before he was employed by the employer and the employer did not contribute anything to the claimant's social security old-age account. Had the claimant been injured prior to the effective date of &sect; 23:1225C(1)(b) he would have been entitled to the relief sought; however, the governing law in workers' compensation actions was that which was in effect at the time of the alleged injury. The clear and unambiguous language of the statute indicated that the &quot;social security reduction&quot; of workers' compensation to which an employer might be entitled was applicable only to certain social security disability benefits, not to social security benefits payable by reasonable of attainment of a specified age.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1987 the decedent suffered a work-related heart attack and was rendered disabled. The condition required daily doses of medication and periodic visits to treating physicians. The decedent suffered a second heart attack in 1991 and died shortly thereafter. The estate sought death benefits under La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23:1231. The court affirmed the denial of Risk Management's peremptory exception because the legislative amendment of &sect; 23:1231A could be applied retroactively to revive a claim extinguished by preemption more than three years prior to the amendment's effective date. The statute created a right of action and defined its existence with reference to a specific time period within which death of the worker had to occur; thus, the time period was neither prescriptive nor preemptive. The statute applied retroactively because it was procedural and did not disturb Risk Management's rights, as it provided that the time from which the two year period would begin to run was suspended as long as the injured worker was being treated for his work-related accident. The court reversed the death benefits award because the only issue before the hearing officer was the peremptory exception.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The drug possessor was arrested for the possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute. During the course of the arrest, his vehicle and a small amount of cash were seized. He was sentenced to one year in prison.

He appealed and claimed that the proceeding was a violation of his rights against double jeopardy. The court reversed and found under the facts of the case that the forfeiture of the automobile did constitute punishment in violation of the double jeopardy clause. The court held that the forfeitures did not occur because the items were contraband and they were not instrumentalities of the crime. And the forfeiture of the vehicle could not be said to serve a solely remedial purpose. The court noted that single proceedings for both the criminal action and the forfeiture would have solved the double jeopardy problem.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied. Defendant appealed and alleged that the resentencing judge erred in determining that the original sentencing judge intended to impose the conditions, because he failed to state them in the sentence and, therefore, his intent could not be determined. The court affirmed the sentence and held that the resentencing judge reviewed the facts and circumstances, including the entire record, and did not err in his sentence, which was within the guidelines and therefore not excessive.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had pleaded guilty to simple robbery six months previously, pled guilty to possession of cocaine and was sentenced by the trial court to a suspended sentence of four years at hard labor, with two years of active probation on various conditions. The trial court denied the state's motion to correct sentence, and the state sought a writ of certiorari. The court granted the writ and vacated the sentence. The court held that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893(A) and (B) permitted a court to suspend a sentence on a second offense only if it found that the offense occurred at least five years after satisfaction of the sentence imposed for the first conviction. The court held that because less than five years had elapsed from the defendant's plea in the prior case the trial court erred by suspending the defendant's sentence and placing him on probation. The court held, however, that if the sentence was the result of a plea bargain, the guilty plea would be constitutionally infirm where the state could not fulfill the bargain. The court remanded the case for a hearing on whether the guilty plea should be vacated based upon breach of a plea bargain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by bill of information with possession of cocaine, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(F)(3), and being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1. Previously, the State had sent a notice of a pending forfeiture pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2608(3)(A) with respect to $ 976 seized from defendant at his arrest. A magistrate signed a judgment granting the State's request for an in rem forfeiture of the $ 976. A jury then found defendant guilty of possession of cocaine. Defendant contended that the forfeiture constituted punishment and that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibited successive punishment for the same conduct. The trial court granted defendant's motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's ruling. The court found that the amount forfeited, $ 976, did not constitute a sanction overwhelmingly disproportionate to the damages defendant caused. The court ruled that the amount forfeited to the government did not qualify as &quot;punishment,&quot; but rather was rationally related to the goal of compensating the State for its loss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of distribution of marijuana. Almost three months later, she was charged with twelve similar counts. Subsequently, after defendant pled guilty to seven counts, she was sentenced to seven concurrent five-year terms of imprisonment. While the trial judge was inclined to grant probation, he did not, finding that she was ineligible under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893, which prohibited a suspended sentence for a defendant charged with any other felony since the date of first conviction. On appeal, defendant contended that art. 893 was unconstitutional. The court noted that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1(B), overrode the requirements of art. 893, so that a sentence in the discretionary sanction zone was subject to probation even though probation was barred by art. 893. Because the trial court improperly relied on La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893 in denying defendant probation where her criminal history index classification fell within the discretionary sanction zone, the court vacated her sentence and remanded the case with instructions for the trial court to consider probation in accordance with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court denying defendant a sentence suspension was vacated and the case was remanded to the trial court so that it could consider imposing probation as provided by statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of one count of distribution of marijuana, a schedule I controlled dangerous substance. The trial court sentenced defendant to serve 782 months in the custody of the Department of Corrections to run consecutively with the sentence for which he was incarcerated at the time of the trial. The conviction was the result of a transaction in which defendant helped undercover officers purchase marijuana. Despite 18 assignments of error raised by defendant on appeal, the court affirmed his conviction and sentence. Among the court's numerous findings, the court found that the trial court had not erred in charging the jury on the definition of reasonable doubt. The court also found that the trial court had not erred in charging the jury on circumstantial evidence or in charging the jury on intent. Moreover, in light of the clear instructions given to the jury, the court found that the placing of the verdict of not guilty after the guilty verdict did not negate or dilute the presumption of innocence. Finally, the court found that other crimes evidence was properly admitted because its probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for six counts of armed robbery and two counts of attempted armed robbery based upon four separate incidents whereupon several of the victims either directly identified defendant or the shotgun and vehicle used in the crimes. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. Defendant's request to approach the jury so they could compare his actual features with those described by the victims was properly denied because defendant was either seated or standing at the defense table at all times during trial. Thus, defendant was allowed to exhibit his scar to the jury although he was not allowed to physically approach them. In addition, defense counsel thoroughly cross-examined all witnesses about any discrepancies in the identification. Although the trial judge could have elaborated more on the reasons for imposing consecutive sentences, the sentences were not excessive and did not violate La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 883. Defendant created a &quot;reign of terror.&quot; The victims were placed in very grave danger and could have easily been killed. Given the serious nature of the crime, consecutive sentences were not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's refusal to grant post-conviction relief. It held that, where defendant failed to contemporaneously object to the jury instruction on reasonable doubt, as required by La. Code Crim. Proc.

The court further held that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict that defendant was guilty of both counts of first degree murder. The court also held that information regarding the identity of three witnesses sought by defendant did not constitute exculpatory evidence, and that where defendant was given ample opportunity at trial to cross-examine two detectives about statements taken from the witnesses and defendant knew of the existence of the witnesses and could have subpoenaed them himself, no actual prejudice was shown to defendant, and thus any failure by the state to disclose was not reversible error. The court finally held that a review of both trial and appellate counsels' performances reflected that defendant was afforded effective legal representation within the guarantees of the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department sued the father seeking child support pursuant to La. Rev. Stat.

After filing an answer denying paternity of two of the children, the father then filed a petition to disavow paternity. The Department filed an exception of prescription under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 189, and an exception of lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The juvenile court granted the exceptions. The court affirmed the grant of the exception of jurisdiction holding that because there were no special statutory provisions granting the juvenile court authority to adjudicate an action to disavow as part of its duties to set and enforce child support, the juvenile court was not clearly wrong in granting the exception. The court held that once the juvenile court determined it had no authority to render a judgment for lack of jurisdiction, pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. arts. 2 and 3, it also lacked authority to determine issues related to that subject; thus, it vacated the judgment on the exception of prescription.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving a pick-up truck that ran into the back of a semi-truck stopped on the shoulder of a highway. As a result of the accident, the passenger in defendant's truck was killed. Defendant's blood alcohol was tested at .27 percent, and the trial court convicted defendant of vehicular homicide in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:32.1. On review, defendant alleged, among other things, that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the chemical analysis of his blood sample. The court concluded that the procedures were sufficient to insure the integrity and reliability of the chemical test and that the State properly complied with those procedures in this case. However, with respect to sentencing, the court found that the trial court followed the old sentencing guidelines, despite the fact that the new guidelines took effect on January 31, 1992 and the defendant's sentencing took place after that date. According to the court, the failure of the trial court to indicate consideration of the new guidelines mandated that defendant's sentence be vacated and the matter remanded for resentencing in compliance with the sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded nolo contendere to five counts of indecent behavior with juveniles. He was sentenced to five concurrent sentences of seven years at hard labor, with credit for time served. Five years of each sentence was suspended, and defendant was placed on active, supervised probation for four years with special conditions of probation. In affirming the decision, the court held that the sentence imposed was not excessive. Although five concurrent sentences of seven years at hard labor were imposed, five years of each sentence were suspended. As a result, defendant received, in effect, five concurrent sentences of two years at hard labor. The period of probation was not illegal, because the two-year period of imprisonment was not imposed as a condition of probation and was not added to the four-year term of probation. However, requiring defendant to register as a sex offender pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:540-549 was an unconstitutional violation of the ex post facto provisions in U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9 and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. Finally, the sentences imposed were not excessive. Considering the reasons for sentencing, the record amply supported the sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, and affirmed his sentences as amended to delete the special condition of probation and/or the order for defendant to register as a sex offender.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected appellants' contention that the statutes were vague because they failed to address the situation where the commercial lessor was also an active member of the organization.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conservation commissioner revised the ownership interests in three wells in which the oil company owned a lease interest based on new geological information, and the oil company filed an application with the commissioner for a determination of the reasonable cost of each of the wells. The commissioner used the dollar-for-dollar method of depreciation and determined that because the production from the wells had exceeded costs, the owners of the original units were not entitled to charge costs to the subsequent owners of the revised units. The oil company brought an action in the district court in which it claimed that the unit of production depreciated well cost method was proper. The trial court agreed, and the commissioner appealed. On review, the court held that the plain language of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 30:10A(2)(d) mandated the dollar-for-dollar method of depreciation. The trial court erred as a matter of law in interpreting the statute, and the trial court's conclusion that the depreciated well cost analysis should have been used was an erroneous substitution of the trial court's judgment for that of the commissioner's.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:193 was constitutional and denied the dealership's requests for a permanent injunction, a declaratory judgment, and attorney's fees in its suit against defendant State to allow it to open on Sundays. Intervenor automobile association joined the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealership sold auto parts and did repair work in addition to selling new and used cars and trucks. It claimed that &sect; 51:193 caused it to lose business to other parts stores and repair shops because it prohibited licensed motor vehicle dealers from opening on Sunday. The court found that &sect; 51:193 was not per se unconstitutional, and that it did not create arbitrary and unreasonable business classifications that had no bearing on the public health and welfare considerations that prompted enactment of Sunday Closing Laws. The classification was rationally related to a legitimate state interest. If Sunday dealership openings were determined by local legislation under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:191, large city dealers would benefit over small rural dealerships who would have to remain open on Sundays to remain competitive and who would likely go out of business. Also, most consumers preferred that dealerships be closed on Sunday to give them an opportunity to examine the vehicles by themselves, so La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:193 encouraged consumers to make informed decisions. It also gave sales personnel a forced day of rest, which safeguarded their health and general welfare.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the district court finding that the law prohibiting Sunday openings by car dealerships was constitutional and denying the dealership's request for a permanent injunction, a declaratory judgment, and attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After learning that he was HIV-positive, the defendant began engaging in sexual intercourse with his victim.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:43.5. The defendant appealed. In affirming, the court rejected the defendant's constitutionality challenge for vagueness. The conduct proscribed was unambiguous in prohibiting the intentional exposure to another to the AIDS virus through sexual contact without the victim's knowledge and consent. The statute offered a clear and definite standard of conduct, and the words were readily understandable by an ordinary person of reasonable intelligence. The court likewise rejected the defendant's argument that the statute violated his right to privacy by interfering with the right of an HIV-infected person to engage in sexual activities. The right of privacy was not absolute, and the state had a compelling interest in discouraging the spread of the HIV virus.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, vacated the conditions of probation, and remanded the case.

The court held that the trial court set conditions of probation that were legally incorrect and the trial court erred in failing to set a specific amount of restitution to be paid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions of aggravated rape and aggravated burglary stemming from a brutal attack upon his estranged wife.

Further, although the house into which defendant entered had served as the family home, defendant no longer lived there, the burgled property was the separate property of the victim, and the victim had made it known to defendant that she did not want him to come into her home. The court likewise rejected defendant's argument that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury on all possible responsive verdicts. The district court correctly excluded guilty of sexual battery, guilty of simple rape, and guilty of attempted simple rape from the list of responsive verdicts applicable to defendant's aggravated rape charge because each was inapplicable where the victim was the offender's spouse.</SPAN></P>

The employer filed an exception of lack of subject matter jurisdiction asserting that OWCA was not the proper forum for litigating a wrongful discharge claim. The trial court granted the exception and dismissed the employee's claim. On appeal, the court affirmed OWCA's decision. As a preliminary matter, the court denied the employer's motion to dismiss the appeal because the record indicated that the appeal was timely filed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The twenty-first Judicial District Court (Louisiana) entered a judgment against the appellant Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development in a personal injury action that was filed by the appellees, driver and passengers, after they were injured when the truck they were riding in hit a bridge that was under the garde of the department. The department appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver of a pickup truck encountered a sudden downpour. The truck fishtailed when the driver applied the brakes, and slid into the exposed railing of a bridge. The department contended that the sole cause-in-fact of the accident was the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and that the sole legal cause was the driver's negligence in failing to maintain control. The department also argued that the condition of the bridge, however defective, was not the cause of the driver's losing control of his vehicle. The court held that the department's duty to maintain reasonably safe highways and shoulders was not to be defined in terms of the driver's conduct because, under comparative fault principles, there could be more than one cause in fact, which would make both wrongdoers liable. The court stated that the negligence of the driver merely reduced, but did not bar, his own damages, and his negligence made him solidarily liable with the department for his passengers' injuries. The court found that the trial court's conclusion that the driver was not at fault was manifestly erroneous. The court allocated fault between the driver and the department at 50 percent each.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed in part, amended in part, and affirmed as amended.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' son was killed in an automobile accident. The driver collided with the son's vehicle while he was having an epileptic seizure. The parents alleged that the department of transportation was negligent in automatically renewing the driver's operating privileges. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the trial court's finding that the department of transportation did not have notice of the driver's epileptic seizure was supported by the evidence. There were discrepancies in the driver's testimony regarding whether he disclosed his medical condition to the department of transportation and it was for the trier of fact to resolve the issue of credibility. The court further held that imposing a duty on the department of transportation under the facts of the case would expand the department of transportation's liability beyond the legislature's intent. Next, the court determined that the department of transportation was immune from liability because any liability imposed would be for negligent policymaking and the rules and procedures for the issuance and renewal of drivers' license was a discretionary act.</SPAN></P>

The bar owner and exotic dancers filed a petition for a temporary restraining order in state court and it was granted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On three dates, defendant sold rock cocaine to undercover police officers. Defendant was charged by grand jury indictment with three counts of distribution of cocaine, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967. Defendant pleaded not guilty and, after a jury trial, was found guilty as charged. Defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 240 months (20 years) on each count, to be served concurrently, with credit for time served. On appeal, defendant filed 23 assignments of error. The court held that defendant's assignments of error were all meritless because they were raised for the first time on appeal. The court noted that there was no requirement for a trial court to instruct the jury about the presumption of innocence during preliminary instructions. The court further noted that during the entire examination of the informant and the officer, defendant did not make any objection and therefore could not now challenge his testimony. The court determined that the state properly established that the cocaine introduced into evidence was the same cocaine purchased from defendant and satisfactorily explained why some of it was in powder form.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents of the survivors were killed in a vehicular collision on a highway. Their car, which was off to the side of the road, was hit by a State Police trooper's car, which was being driven in excess of the legal speed limit. The trial court concluded that both the decedents and the State Trooper were negligent and apportioned fault at two-thirds to the decedents and one-third to the Trooper. The trial court also awarded damages totaling more than $ 3.3 million to the survivors for which the State was held liable for one-third. Both parties appealed the judgment as to the apportionment of fault. The court held that the conclusions that the state trooper was partially at fault in causing the accident, that the decedents' conduct also contributed to the accident, and as to the apportionment of fault, were not manifestly erroneous. The court noted that while the decedents' stalled vehicle was not readily apparent at the time of the accident, it was discernible to a prudent motorist. The court noted that the decedents had ample time to realize that they would not be able to restart their vehicle and should have taken other measures to protect themselves from oncoming traffic.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs argued that the liability cap for damages under the Medical Malpractice Act, specifically La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.45A, was unconstitutional, and the limitation was not available to an insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to plaintiffs' assertion that the $ 100,000 liability cap for damages for a qualified health care provider was unconstitutional, the court pointed out that the state supreme court had recently considered the issue in an opinion in which it was stated that overall the Louisiana Medical Malpractice Act represented a reasonable but imperfect balance between the rights of victims and those of health care providers, and did not violate the state or federal constitutions. As to the argument that the limitation was a &quot;personal defense&quot; not available to the liability insurer, it had not been directly addressed by the state courts, but the court noted that in another opinion the supreme court, when considering another malpractice issue, stated that the limitation of the Louisiana Medical Malpractice Act, specifically La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.45A, applied to the insurer as well as the health care provider. Despite plaintiffs' counsel's urgings, the court refused to presume that the supreme court inferentially overruled the opinion when that court did not expressly do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which on remand by the court denied defendant's second motion for a new trial. Defendant alleged numerous errors, including that he was denied the right to a fair and impartial jury, that he was denied the right to a new trial, and that it was error to determine that defendant was competent to stand trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first degree murder of his children and attempted first degree murder of his wife. After his conviction for first degree murder, defendant was twice denied motions for a new trial. The second motion alleging juror misconduct was denied on remand by the court, on the grounds that it was untimely and not based on new evidence, and defendant appealed. The court conditionally affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that because it was unclear as to whether illicit contact between a juror and the deputy sheriff occurred after the verdict but before sentencing, which was not prejudicial, or before the verdict, which could be prejudicial, an evidentiary hearing was needed to decide defendant's motion. The court therefore remanded the case. Notwithstanding its remand, the court addressed the denial of the motion and held that under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 851, defendant did not show grounds for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, because the new information about jury misconduct was not admissible. The court held that defendant was competent to stand trial, because his mental capacity to proceed was supported by expert testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court conditionally affirmed defendant's convictions. The court remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether illicit contact between a juror and the deputy sheriff occurred before or after the verdict, because contact before the verdict that was found to be prejudicial was grounds for a new trial. Defendant was properly found competent to stand trial, because his mental capacity to proceed was supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's petition alleged that the Superintendent of the board, in return for appointment to his position, promised the board that he would dismiss the employee and others, solely for reasons of political patronage. The petition also alleged that the dismissal without notice or a hearing, coupled with the board's failure to adopt rules for dismissal of non-tenured employees pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:81.5 violated his statutory and due process rights. On appeal, the court reversed the dismissal, and held that the petition stated a cause of action. The court ruled that the employee was not terminable at will, because &sect; 17:81.5 specifically regulated that employment relationship. The court held that the board's authority was subject to legislative limitation under La. Const. art. VIII, and that &sect; 17.81.5 purposefully removed such employees from &quot;at will&quot; status, entitling them to due process. The court held that without having enacted the required rules, the board exceeded its authority by terminating the employee in the absence of some demonstrable compelling need.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents filed suit seeking to hold the driver, police officer and the alcohol provider liable for injuries sustained by the parents' minor child. The police officer, driver and alcohol provider filed motions for summary judgment, which were granted. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in the part the motions. As to the police officer, the court held that generally the duty owed by a police officer was to the public and not individuals. Thus, no liability occurred individually to any one person. The court concluded that even if the officer owed a duty to children, there was no breach because the officer had no reason to believe that the driver was intoxicated and to arrest her. Second, the court held that the driver was not entitled to summary judgment because there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the driver was actually the driver. Credibility issues were not appropriate for summary judgment. Third, the court held that the alcohol provider could not escape liability for acts of the immediate purchaser of those items and where the quantity purchased by the minor indicated that more than one person would probably consume the items.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that there was sufficient evidence to support the hearing officer's finding that the employee did not demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that his work stress was extraordinary and unusual in comparison to that of the average layout and fitter. The court also determined that the employee did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that his work stress or exertion was the predominant and major cause of his heart attack. The court concluded that the employer should not pay benefits for health complications that began in the employee's bed. The court affirmed the hearing officer's decision, and denied the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The putative father was ordered to undergo blood testing in the State's paternity suit. On appeal from the trial court's judgment decreeing parentage, the father argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:396 authorizing mandatory testing was unconstitutional. In affirming, the court ruled that an order for blood testing to determine paternity was a search and seizure within the meaning of the U.S. Const. amend. IV and that the issue was whether a court-ordered blood test was reasonable and justified under the circumstances. The court noted that a blood test was minimally intrusive, relatively painless, and medically safe and that, in facilitating a determination of paternity, blood tests were highly reliable and unequaled in evidentiary value. The court found that the father had voluntarily submitted to the test as ordered and waived the issue by failing to request a protective order or a hearing, but ruled that any failure of the trial court to conduct a preliminary hearing was harmless error in light of the mother's trial testimony regarding exclusive sexual contact with the father during the time of conception.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed the judgment from the 34th Judicial District Court, St. Bernard Parish (Louisiana), which found that 1988 La. Acts 938, &sect; 3 did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to approve the workers' compensation settlement between the employee and defendants, the employer and its insurer, and which dismissed his suit to annul the judgment approving the settlement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee was injured in the course of his employment and received workers' compensation (WC) benefits. The employee and his employer and its insurer reached a settlement of the employee's claim. The trial court approved the settlement on the same day that the parties filed a joint petition to compromise the claim. After the employee received his payment, he filed suit to annul the judgment approving the settlement, and the trial court dismissed his suit. On appeal, the court reversed and granted the employee's petition. 1988 La. Acts 938, &sect; 3, which divested the trial court of jurisdiction to approve WC compromise settlement claims, became effective before the parties filed their joint petition. Although the amendment to La. Const. art. V, &sect; 16 became effective after the settlement was approved, the amendment was retroactive to the effective date of 1988 La. Acts 938, &sect; 3 because Act 938 was procedural rather than substantive. Thus, under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. arts. 3 and 2002, the judgment approving the settlement was void and had to be annulled.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that the latter did not violate La. Const. of 1974 art. I, &sect; 20. The sentencing guidelines suggested a four and one-half year sentence. However, defendant was a second felony offender. Hence, his sentence was required to be imposed without the benefit of probation or suspension, and La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authority sought to obtain land adjacent to its convention center in order to expand. After negotiations for the purchase of land from the prior owners failed, the authority instituted expropriation proceedings. The prior owners then sold the property as part of a larger tract to defendant buyer for 11 million dollars and added the buyer to the suit. The trial judge found that the authority met all statutory prerequisites to its expropriation suit and that it had met its burden of proving that the property was for a public necessity. A jury awarded 13 million dollars to the buyer. On appeal, the court held that the evidence established the right to expropriation based on public need. The evidence established a public need for the expansion of the convention center and that such an expansion would promote economic growth. The court rejected the authority's assertion that the buyer, as the new owner, could not be compensated for more than he paid for the property, where he knew the property was gong to be subject to expropriation. The court also held that the trial judge did not err in instructing the jury to determine the value of the property as of the date of the trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and remanded for a determination of attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three assailants approached the victim and her husband and attempted to rob them. The victim was shot and died later that night. Information implicating defendant and two others was obtained from an anonymous call to a tip line. The three were indicted for first-degree murder. The charge against defendant was subsequently amended to second-degree murder. A jury found him guilty of manslaughter. He was sentenced as a second felony offender to 35 years at hard labor to be served consecutively with any other sentence he was serving. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant's enhanced sentence was within the statutory limits and less than the maximum sentence allowable. The trial judge's stipulation that the sentence was to be served consecutively with other sentences was within his discretion. The circumstances of the crime and defendant's extensive criminal history put him in the most egregious class of offenders. There were no mitigating circumstances. A more severe sentence than that recommended by the sentencing guidelines was warranted. The record supported the trial court's deviation from the sentencing guidelines and the sentence imposed was not unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole, probation, or suspension for second degree murder under &sect; 14:30.1. The court granted defendant a new trial. The court held that the instruction on the definition of reasonable doubt was erroneous because it contained a misdescription of the burden of proof that vitiated all of the jury's findings. The court determined that the deprivation of defendant's right to a jury trial under the Sixth Amendment was a structural defect worthy of departing from the policy against the plain error doctrine and overruling State v.

The use of the state's Long Arm Statute was justified where there were minimum contacts within the state to make it reasonable and just according to traditional concepts of fair play and substantial justice. The court held that if the absent spouse was served pursuant to &sect; 13:3201and claimed that the court did not have jurisdiction, that spouse had the right to challenge jurisdiction by an exception.

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred by ruling that statements made by defendant to the officers following his arrest would be admissible for impeachment purposes if defendant took the stand. The court found no merit in defendant's argument, concluding that defendant's direct examination was subject to impeachment by the State. Further, defendant did not preserve the issue for review because he did not file a pretrial motion. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in imposing an excessive sentence.

</DIV>

On appeal, the insurer argued that &sect; 9:180(A) was unconstitutional because it resulted in a taking of property without just compensation in violation of La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 4. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the appellate court held that &sect; 9:180(A) allowed property to be presumed abandoned even though the obligation had prescribed as between the owner and the holder. The court noted that the insurer was the holder of an obligation in favor of its insured and that the expiration of a prescriptive period merely barred the insured's remedy but did not extinguish the cause of action itself.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on an informant's tip, police executed a search warrant at a house owned by appellant. A narcotics dog sniffed out cocaine and $ 851 in one bedroom, and in another bedroom sniffed out over $ 15,000 that was stashed in a footlocker. Police also found a handgun in this bedroom. In reversing the judgment, the court held that the $ 15,000 was not in proximity to the cocaine for the purpose of permitting an inference under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2611(G) that it was proceeds of drug sales made by appellant's son. The court noted that appellant also supplied evidence that the $ 15,000 and handgun were not connected to the cocaine sufficient to rebut the presumption under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2611(H) that these items were subject to forfeiture. The court noted that appellant testified that the $ 15,000 was hers and was related to financing she obtained to build a house, and that the owner of the gun, appellant's ex-husband, testified that he had given it to appellant as a safety precaution because their children lived with appellant in the house and the house had been the target of attempted break-ins.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contractor sought review of a judgment of the First Judicial District Court, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), which granted appellee tax commission summary judgment in the contractor's action to recover $ 48,833 paid in protest through the tax commission to the city as a use tax. The contractor argued that he was entitled to a credit against the city's use tax for sales tax paid to the parish school board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school board and the city imposed a sales and use tax on tangible personal property purchased or used within its boundaries. The contractor, a road and bridge builder, had purchased equipment, some of which it later used on highway construction projects within the city limits. When the contractor purchased the equipment, he paid the state sales tax and the school board tax. The contractor argued that he should have been credited with the tax it paid to the school board under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2718.2A. The court reversed the summary judgment in favor of the commission. Specifically, the court held that &sect; 33:2718.2A mandated that the contractor be credited against the sales and use tax imposed by the city where he had paid sales and use taxes to the parish school board based upon the same tangible personal property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The law firm filed an action for mandamus, injunction, and declaratory relief seeking the right to examine, copy, and microfilm motor vehicle accident reports in the city's custody. Defendants had denied an earlier written request. The trial court denied relief, holding that the law firm did not have the right to examine the public records because it was not an interested person under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:398(H). The law firm did not represent anyone involved in an accident, but sought access to the reports to solicit business. On appeal, the court reversed. The law firm made its written request to examine the reports and the trial court rendered its decision prior to the effective date of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:398(H). Because the statute affected a substantive right guaranteed by La. Const. art. 12 &sect; 3, it could not be given retroactive effect. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:31 gave the law firm the right to free and unrestricted access to the records. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:398(D)(4) entitled the law firm to inspect, copy, or reproduce the reports.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1985 the patient was given a blood transfusion that contained the HIV virus which can lead to the development of AIDS. At the time, no test was available to test the hospital's blood supply. In 1989 the patient was diagnosed with HIV when she took a blood test for an insurance policy. The district court dismissed the claim as barred by &sect; 9:5628. On review, the patient argued that she should have been advised by her doctor to test for HIV after her surgery, and that because of the failure, the doctrine of contra non valentem suspended the operation of the statute until her condition was diagnosed. The court rejected the argument, holding that the Louisiana Supreme Court had held that the doctrine did not apply in medical malpractice cases. The court found the result to be unfortunate but was nevertheless constrained to affirm the dismissal. The court determined that &sect; 9:5628 was peremptive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates contended that the legislation,&nbsp;La. Code Crim. Proc.

They contended that all of the inmates in the prison shared in this common right, so that the commonality prerequisite, La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 591(1), for a class action was met. In reversing the judgment, the court held that the trial court abused its discretion in certifying the class. The court noted several ways in which the inmate population did not share the same right with respect to post-conviction relief. For example, the court observed that many inmates had already exhausted their right to relief, so that the curtailment of the right had no effect on them. The court also noted that if even one inmate successfully obtained a declaration that art. 930.8 was unconstitutional, all of the similarly situated inmates would benefit from the declaration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the department of transportation and development (DOTD), appealed from the Twenty-First Judicial District in and for the Parish of Tangipahoa (Louisiana), which rendered judgment in favor of plaintiffs, the family of a deceased who was struck and killed by a train as she drove over a railroad crossing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The crossing in question had a warning sign, a cross buck, and a stop sign. The DOTD contended that it had no duty to provide protective devices or signalize railroad crossings on roads which were not part of the state highway system. The trial court determined that the DOTD owed a duty to the decedent to see that this crossing was properly upgraded with the installation of active warning devices because it was aware of the high volume of traffic and the high number of trains traveling through the crossing, and because it was aware that the existing signs were inadequate. The court held that such circumstances constituted the assumption by the DOTD of the responsibility to upgrade the crossing. The failure to do so within a reasonable time after assumption of the responsibility constituted a breach of duty. Consequently, the court concluded that the trial court was not manifestly erroneous in determining that the DOTD had ample time to install the protective devices and upgrade the crossing and its failure to timely do so was a breach of duty. Moreover, the court agreed with the trial court that had active safety devices been installed, the accident would not have occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in favor of the deceased's family and against the DOTD.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company sought review of a judgment of the Twenty-Second Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. Tammany (Louisiana), which denied its petition for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against defendant village.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A company sought to mine a gravel deposit on property that was located within the limits of a village. The village had an ordinance that prohibited the digging of a gravel pit within a 1,200 foot radius of any building that was used as a residence, unless those affected would waive the prohibition. Because the property owners within the 1,200 foot radius would not waive the prohibition, the company filed a complaint against the village in which it argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional, or in the alternative, the ordinance was invalid because it violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:4723. The trial court dismissed the petition, and the company appealed. On review, the court reversed the judgment below. The court held that the village did not have a general plan, and there were no definitions, descriptions, or classifications for use in property development. Rather, the ordinance under scrutiny was a solitary, single industry restriction. Because there was no comprehensive plan, and the ordinance was not a comprehensive plan, the enactment of the ordinance did not comply with the statute and was invalid. The court did not address the constitutionality of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and rendered an order that a judgment be entered that declared an ordinance of the village invalid and unenforceable.

On appeal, he argued that the evidence was insufficient for his conviction, his post-trial motions were improperly denied, his sentence was improper, and his motion to reconsider the sentence should have been allowed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed pro se post-trial motions and his counsel filed an amended motion for new trial. On appeal, the court held that the pro se motions were not validly before it. Defendant could not be both represented and representative at the same time. Also, defendant's motions had no basis in law under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 859. The court held that the evidence was sufficient for conviction. Although defendant did not get away with the victim's purse, the facts were sufficient to establish the &quot;taking&quot; element under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64. The court held that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements necessary to sustain the armed robbery conviction. Therefore, defendant's counsel's amended motion for new trial was properly denied. The court held that defendant's sentence of 49-1/2 years at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence with credit for time served was not excessive, and the record supported the sentence. Despite the trial court's failure to follow La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 (effective Jan. 31, 1992), the court affirmed the sentence. The court amended the sentence form to correct an error patent.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 17:1201,1202, the board could deduct no more than the amount paid a substitute in the event of an unauthorized absence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties' agreement provided for additional authorized sick days beyond the 10 days provided in La. Rev. Stat.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:1202, the deduction should be no greater than the amount paid for a substitute. The trial court found in favor of the union. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 17:1202 was intended to give teachers a fringe benefit, and the fact that the agreement provided additional sick days could not be construed as a waiver of the teacher's benefit under &sect; 17:1202. The court found that this result did not create the potential for abuse of sick leave, because the board could remove such an abuser under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:443. The court ruled that this construction of the statutes and the agreement did not amount to an unconstitutional gift, because it was a benefit earned by the employment itself.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the wildlife and fisheries commission was not required to comply with public bidding procedures before it granted shell dredging leases because the harvesting of live oysters was not a mineral right as defined by La.

The court held that the leases were not disguised sales of navigable waterbottoms which was prohibited by La. Const. art. IX, &sect; 3 or a donation of state property in violation of La. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was married to his wife for one week when he murdered her. He was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced. He sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment on the grounds that defendant could not have used the insanity or intoxication defense because the fact that defendant was drinking before he committed the murder was not, of itself, sufficient to negate specific intent. The court held that defendant failed to establish a specific statutory provision to disqualify the district attorney's secretary from service on the grand jury. The court further ruled that voluntary intoxication was a defense to a prosecution for a crime only when the condition precluded the presence of a specific criminal intent or of a special knowledge required in that particular crime. The court concluded that defendant understood what he was doing and what was happening because he continued to refuse to give a statement until he spoke to an attorney his father was hiring.

On appeal, the court held that the legal sentence in the transcript prevailed over the illegal sentence in the minute entry. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:966(A)(1), 40:966(B)(1) did not require a minimum amount of heroin in order for defendant to be convicted of heroin distribution and sentenced to life imprisonment. Thus, under La. Code Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association (LIGA), appealed from a judgment of the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), in a personal injury action arising from an automobile accident, which granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiff's insurer, finding LIGA's coverage on behalf of an insolvent insurer to be primary, and held LIGA liable for plaintiff's damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was involved in an auto accident with another driver, whose insurer was insolvent. The LIGA was substituted for the insolvent insurer. The trial court found LIGA, in lieu of the insolvent insurer, had primary coverage, and not plaintiff's uninsured motorist (UM) insurer. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that under the 1992 amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1386, plaintiff was required to exhaust his UM coverage before making a claim against LIGA. The court held that plaintiff's claim against LIGA was still &quot;pending&quot; under 1992 La. Acts 237, &sect; 3, which amended La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1386, when the trial court considered the issue of primary coverage between the UM insurer and LIGA, thus the trial court should have applied the 1992 amendment to &sect; 22:1386 then in effect, which made the UM coverage primary. The court held that the legislature intended the amendment to be retroactive, and that this did not unconstitutionally interfere with any vested rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court judgment which granted partial summary judgment to plaintiff's insurer and found LIGA's coverage to be primary, and rendered judgment in favor of LIGA, holding the plaintiff's insurer primarily responsible for plaintiff's claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a body shop and its owner, appealed a decision of the 19th Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which convicted them of illegal transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Defendants argued that the trial court erred in denying their motion to quash and in finding that the evidence was sufficient to convict them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged by grand jury indictment and convicted of illegal transportation of hazardous wastes and illegal disposal of hazardous wastes under La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30:2183G(2). The trial court found that the body shop owner paid a third party to dispose of containers of spent paint thinner at two uninhabited houses. Tests conclusively proved that the substances were hazardous waste. Finding guilt, the trial court deferred sentencing, placed defendants on active supervised probation for three years, and applied special conditions to the probation. Defendants appealed. The court held that as the trial court accepted the testimony of the State's witnesses and rejected those presented by the defense, a rational trier of fact could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that every element of the offenses had been established. However, the statutory scheme did not define the felony offense; it merely set guidelines for the definition of the offense. Thus, the definition of hazardous waste and penalties for violations were left to the executive branch, and the court found that this constituted an unconstitutional delegation of constitutional authority to the executive branch.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which had refused to quash the indictment as unconstitutional, and the motion to quash was granted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his sentence from the 21st Judicial District Court, Tangipahoa Parish (Louisiana) on remand from the court. He was sentenced on each count to concurrent terms of 99 years at hard labor, without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence after pleading guilty to six counts of armed robbery, violations of La.

Defendant pleaded guilty to violations of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64, was sentenced, the sentence was overturned by the Louisiana Supreme Court, he was resentenced, and he appealed that sentence of 99 years at hard labor. His contentions were that the sentence was excessive and that the trial court erred in using an uncharged murder count as criminal history, and that a former prosecutor's testimony as to a sentencing judge's findings violated his right to confrontation. The court held that the trial court adequately limited the consideration of the prosecutor's testimony and that under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1, prior history was not limited to convictions. The court then considered defendant's contention that the sentence was not proportionate and found that claim to be without merit due to criminal conduct, the severity of the crime, and the ongoing criminal history of defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an injured diver and his parents, and defendants, the City of Morgan City and the State of Louisiana, appealed from a judgment of the 16th Judicial District Court, St. Mary Parish (Louisiana), which found the diver, the city, and the State equally liable for damages awarded to the diver and his parents for injuries sustained by the diver in a lake leased from the State by the city, limited by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5106.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The diver, an experienced swimmer, had been trained to dive in the Coast Guard, but dove from a bulkhead into two feet of muddy water when he saw swimmers in chest-deep water 20 feet ahead, resulting in quadriplegia. A sign erected by the city after a similar accident three years earlier stated &quot;Swim and Dive at Your Own Risk.&quot; The trial judge found each party 1/3 liable, awarded the $ 500,000 limit against both the city and the State, denied the parent's claims for emotional distress, and awarded the parents damages for loss of consortium. On appeal, the court amended. The court held that the &quot;recreational immunity&quot; statutes did not immunized the city from liability arising from its use of the leased property, and that the lease did not transfer garde from the State to the city so as to relieve the State of its duty to the diver. The court found that the city and State owed a duty to the diver to warn of the danger, and the city's sign did not warn of the nature of the risk. The court held that the parents had no cause of action without being present at the scene, and their derivative claim was subject to son's &sect; 13:5106 cap, which limited total damages against both parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the district court judgment, which awarded damages to the diver and his parents for injuries sustained by the diver in a lake leased from the State by the city, and otherwise affirmed. The court reversed the award to the parents for loss of consortium, re-allocated fault, reduced damages for loss of wages, and applied the statutory limit to total both the city and State awards.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 14:28.1, after he attempted to hire a hit man to kill a witness who was going to testify against him in a criminal trial. The hit man was actually an undercover police officer. The court reversed defendant's conviction on the basis of one assignment of error without discussing the remaining assignments. On appeal by the State, the supreme court reversed the court's judgment and remanded the case for consideration of the remaining assignments of error. In affirming the conviction, the court held that &sect; 14:28.1 was not unconstitutionally vague because the State needed to prove incitement of either first or second degree murder to prove defendant guilty. The court also held that &sect; 14:28.1 was not duplicative of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:28, incitement of a felony, because it dealt with incitement of two of the worst types of felonies. The court further held that it was irrelevant whether the jury found defendant guilty of soliciting first degree murder or second degree murder because solicitation of either was proscribed under the same statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:28.1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State and its Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) appealed from judgments of the Twenty-Seventh Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. Landry (Louisiana) finding them liable to plaintiffs, parents for the death or injury of their minor and for loss of consortium. The parents of one minor appealed claiming that damages awarded for the injuries to their child and for their loss of consortium were inadequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A minor was killed when he drove his vehicle into a hole in a highway that was under repair. Two other minors, who were passengers, were seriously injured. The minors' parents recovered judgments for personal injury, wrongful death, and loss of consortium against the State and DOTD. The court affirmed a judgment that the State and DOTD were 80 percent at fault, but reduced the damages awarded to one minor to the maximum established by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5106. The State and DOTD did not in fact contract away their responsibility to the general public for the road construction and the placement of warning signs, and that duty was nondelegable in any event. La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315.6, providing for compensation for the mental anguish of bystanders did not apply to limit the damages for mental anguish awarded to one of the injured minors, which were for anguish from the injuries he suffered in the accident, and not for witnessing the deaths of his companions. The damages awarded for the injuries and future medical expenses of one of the minors and for the loss of consortium of that minor's parents were inadequate and an abuse of discretion, and were increased accordingly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was modified to reduce the damages awarded to one minor against the State to the statutory maximum, and to increase the damages awarded for the injuries and future medical expenses of one of the minors, and for loss of consortium of that minor's parents. As so modified the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:92(7). Defendant waived formal arraignment and entered a plea of not guilty in the 15th Judicial District Court, Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana). The jury found him guilty on both counts. Defendant was sentenced to two years at hard labor on each count, to run concurrent, with credit for time served. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile and was concurrently sentenced to two years on each count. He contended the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. He claimed the district court erred in overruling his objection to the admission of testimony as a victim's &quot;first report&quot; of sexually assaultive behavior. He claimed there was no &quot;sexually assaultive behavior&quot;, nor any act or conduct of a sexual nature proven. As there was no need for actual physical contact for the actions of a person to have been considered sexually assaultive behavior under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 801(D)(1)(d), the testimony was properly admitted. He also claimed the district court erred in imposing an excessive sentence. Yet, after a review of the record and a request to the clerk, the court found that no motion to reconsider was made at sentencing or later filed, so defendant was precluded from raising this point on appeal. The district court's failure to have informed him of the prescriptive period for post-conviction relief was not grounds to have reversed the sentence, but notice of the period was required within 10 days of this opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions and the sentences imposed were affirmed. Instructions were provided regarding the requirement that defendant be notified of the prescriptive period for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The invalid was involuntarily admitted to the hospital, and his brother petitioned for judicial commitment and interdiction. Following several hearings, the trial court committed the invalid to a nursing home and ordered an interdiction. The invalid appealed, and the court found that the trial court erred in ordering the involuntary judicial commitment and full interdiction of his person and property. It ordered the invalid, under a limited interdiction, to pay three-fourths of the brother's attorney fees and all expenses. The invalid appealed, and the court held that the trial court was correct in awarding fees to the brother for fees in the limited interdiction action. Yet, the trial court abused its discretion in determining the appropriate amount of the attorney fee award. Further, it determined that any argument as to the constitutionality of the statutes was not properly before the court. As the invalid had an opportunity to be heard and to defend his position, his constitutional attack on the interdiction proceeding was without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment ordering the invalid to pay the attorney fees and expenses of his brother, but amended the award, calling it unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in December 1989 with theft of over $ 500.00 in violation of La. Rev. Stat.

The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to quash on the basis of the expiration of the two-year time limitation for commencement of trial in felony cases pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 578. Under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 580 the running of the period of limitation was suspended upon the filing of a motion to quash or other preliminary plea; defendant's filing of a joint motion for a continuance in April 1991 constituted a preliminary plea such that the limitation period was suspended, giving the State a minimum of one year after the granting of the continuance to commence trial. The trial court did not err in failing to declare a mistrial after the jury became aware of a courthouse bomb threat; the trial court was in the best position to determine whether defendant was prejudiced and there was no indication in the record that the bomb threat affected the jury's decision.</SPAN></P>

On appeal from defendant's conviction the court affirmed. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motions for new trial and for post verdict judgment of acquittal; the evidence that defendant aimed the gun at the victim, announced his intention to kill somebody, and laughed after firing the shot was sufficient to establish specific intent. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion in arrest of judgment; La. Rev. Stat.

Code &sect; 14211 did not violate La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 28. Defendants, the City's mayor and council members, were also parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax enacted in New Orleans, La., Mun. Code &sect; 14211 required any person who furnished telecommunications services for compensation to pay a tax for the privilege of engaging in such business in the City. The tax was based on a percentage of the gross receipts of the business. The corporation filed suit for a declaratory judgment that the tax was an occupational license tax that exceeded the maximum limits imposed by La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 28, which prohibited a local government from imposing an occupational license tax not greater than that imposed by the state. Both the corporation and the City filed motions for summary judgment, and the trial court found in favor of the City. On appeal, the court held that the tax violated art. VI, &sect; 28 because the operational effect of the tax was to raise revenues, which was an exercise of the City's taxing power rather than its police power. The court found that no matter how &quot;occupational license tax&quot; was defined, the City's tax fell within that definition for purposes of the prohibition set forth in art. VI, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 47:2402(6), exempted not only educational institutions located in Louisiana, but also those located in other states offering reciprocity to Louisiana institutions. The court found that there was no conflict between the city's ordinance and &sect; 47:2402(6), because the state exemption applied only to the state inheritance tax. The ordinance thus did not conflict with the state statute. Further, the Louisiana Constitution granted home rule to the city, which thereby retained the power to tax.</SPAN></P>

The mother filed a peremptory exception of no cause of action and a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment and the father appealed. The father contended that the trial court erred in determining that he was prohibited from litigating paternity of the child 13 years after his birth, under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 189. The court affirmed and held that the father's right to disavow paternity was extinguished under the statute. The court rejected the father's argument that the legal presumption of paternity under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his manslaughter conviction, based solely on circumstantial evidence and a jailhouse informer's testimony, finding that he had aided and abetted three other minors in abducting, raping, and murdering a 13-year-old boy more than five years before trial. On appeal, the court held that the juvenile bindover statue, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1570 (1984), was constitutional even though it did not require a preliminary hearing to decide whether defendant were mature enough to be tried as an adult. Defendant lacked standing to raise the issue of whether the Fifth Amendment rights of a co-defendant, the State's star witness who unexpectedly recanted on the stand his previous statements implicating defendant, had been violated. The State was permitted to declare the recanting witness hostile and to cross-examine him pursuant to La. Code Evid. Ann. arts. 607 and 613. The jailhouse informer was not an &quot;agent&quot; of the State because he received nothing of value in exchange for his testimony against defendant. The trial court properly restricted defense counsel's repetitive voir dire examination. Circumstantial evidence of defendant's complicity was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

The in-field identification in this case was not so suggestive. The identifications were made shortly after the burglary, and they were not the products of a lineup. Identifications based on clothing, where the clothing had been suppressed, were not unconstitutional where the evidence would have been discovered or obtained in a legal fashion.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that defendant did not file a motion to suppress at any time before, during, or after trial; therefore he could not argue that the objects were seized pursuant to an unconstitutional search. The court concluded that the cocaine seized was not the fruit of an illegal seizure of defendant. The State proved beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements necessary to sustain defendant's conviction for possession of cocaine. The court ruled that the record proved that defendant's counsel informed the trial court that defendant wanted to plead guilty to the charge. Defendant stated that he agreed with the plea and understood his right to a hearing, but wished to waive the hearing and enter his plea.

The court reviewed the evidence rulings and held that the trial court determination of relevance was afforded great weight and was not disturbed absent an abuse of discretion, which the court did not find. The court held that admission of the record of defendant's prior drug conviction to impeach his testimony was error because the record included a nolle prosequi of another charge, contrary to La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Employer claimed that the trial court erred by: (1) failing to properly control the proceedings; (2) failing to confine closing arguments within proper bounds; (3) excluding the testimony of its expert economist; (4) allowing punitive damages; (5) allowing $ 17.00 per day in maintenance cure, and (6) awarding prejudgment interest. The court amended its judgment but affirmed. The court said that a trial court had a wide berth when it came to control of the proceedings and that it would not have reversed unless a clear abuse of that discretion was shown. In addition, the court said that the trial court had abused its discretion in excluding the testimony of a substitute witness, but that the error was harmless. The court also held that the maintenance award should have been calculated at $ 8.00 per day, not $ 17.00 per day. Additionally, the court said that prejudgment interest was only proper from date of judgment, not the date of suit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant district attorney appealed from the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Division &quot;L&quot; (Louisiana), which entered judgment granting plaintiff inmate's petition for a writ of mandamus compelling the district attorney to produce to a third party all documents relating to the inmate's criminal case. The district attorney claimed that the trial court improperly applied La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:32(C)(2) (amended 1992).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the district attorney denied the inmate's request for documents in the district attorney's possession relating to his case to be provided to a third party, the inmate obtained a writ of mandamus compelling production. On appeal, the court affirmed. The district attorney claimed that the trial court improperly applied La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:32(C)(2) (amended 1989) instead of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:32(C)(1)(a) (Supp. 1992). The court disagreed, pointing out that the 1989 amendment did not change the language of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:32(C)(2) (amended 1989). The court held that the legislature intended to legislature to establish the procedure for obtaining access to public records from the custodian of non-state agencies, clerks of courts, and state agencies. The district attorney's office was a state agency; hence, the trial court did not err when it applied La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:32C(2) (Supp. 1992). The court also held that &sect; 44:32(C) was not unconstitutionally ambiguous. The court further denied the inmate's request for damages under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 44:35 (Supp. 1992) and La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 2164 (1961).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which issued a writ of mandamus compelling the district attorney to provide copies of the requested documents.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.39 et seq. The trial court limited plaintiffs' recovery to $ 500,000 pursuant to &sect; 40:1299.39.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs filed motions to supplement the record on appeal to assert that the hospital was liable for its primary or independent negligence, as well as vicarious liability. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that (1) there was no error in the finding that the hospital breached the standard of care that it owed the decedent based on evidence that the decedent's condition was treatable and that he would have survived if he had received appropriate medical treatment, (2) there was no abuse of discretion in the award of loss of future earnings and the damages payable to the decedent's children, (3) the motions to supplement the record were denied because of plaintiffs' failure to previously allege the hospital's direct liability, and (4) plaintiffs' challenge to the limitation of damages under &sect; 40:1299.39 would not be considered because the attorney general was not served as a party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for aggravated crime against nature, aggravated rape, and attempted second degree murder. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion for mistrial due to a reference by the prosecution to inadmissible evidence of other crimes allegedly committed by him. Defendant also claimed that there was insufficient evidence to convict him, and that the trial judge failed to adequately articulate the reasons and factual basis for imposition of sentence as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1(C). The court rejected these arguments. The court held that the victim's testimony and the factfinder's discretion in weighing credibility, together with the physical evidence introduced at trial, when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, the sentence pronounced by the trial court was proportional to the seriousness of the offenses and the offender's criminal history.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

A year after the insurance company stopped making payments, the law governing such payments was enacted, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6:1124. The statute provided, inter alia, that it applied retroactively. The insureds brought this action, and the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the bank. On review, the court held that in this particular case, the statute did not apply retroactively because the rights of the insureds vested under the contract a year before the legislation became effective.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:134, and sentenced him to four years at hard labor, two years suspended, placed him on active supervised probation for five years, fined him, and ordered him to pay restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mayor was found guilty of malfeasance in office. He alleged that the evidence had not supported a finding of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:404 imposed a duty on all mayors to administer in conformity with the ordinances adopted by the board of aldermen. This was an affirmative duty, a violation of which could have constituted the crime of malfeasance in office. Looking at all of the evidence, a reasonable trier of fact could find the mayor knew that payment of accrued annual leave and sick leave was in violation of ordinances. Therefore, his actions not in conformity with the statute breached his duty and constituted malfeasance. As for the mayor's claim that the indictment was fatally defective, the omission of &quot;sacramental language&quot; was a defect of form only and was cured by amendment before trial. Although the indictment was not dated as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 462, the filing dates of the original and amended indictments were noted on both indictments. As for the mayor's argument that the amended indictment was defective as not signed by the jury foreman, no requirement mandated his signature on an amendment of this nature.</SPAN></P>

He was also adjudicated to be in contempt of court. The court terminated the wife's right to alimony because the court was not convinced that the wife could not obtain employment. The court affirmed the award of child support, and believed that it was in the interest of all that the remaining issues of visitation, place of visits, and length of visits should be reconsidered by the trial court because the circumstances of both parties have changed and the children have grown older. The court further remanded regarding the issue of contempt. The court stated that the contempt proceedings should be abated until reconsideration by the trial court, so that the father could visit with his children without fear of arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor child nearly drowned and suffered severe brain damage as a result of an accident near the State's fender system. The parents, individually and on behalf of their son, filed a personal injury action against the State claiming the electrical system on the fender, under the control of the State, was defective, causing electrical currents to leak into the water. The trial court awarded the victim $ 3,453,781.42 in special damages for past and future medical care and loss of earning capacity. With respect to general damages, the trial court held that his general damage claims, along with his parents' loss of consortium claims, constituted &quot;one claim&quot; and were subject to the $ 500,000 cap. The court found no manifest error in the trial court's conclusion that there was a light bulb in the southwest navigation lantern and that the parents' evidence established that wire to be the source of the leaking electrical current. The court determined that the cap on general damages was not unconstitutional because it was reasonably related to the legitimate state interests in providing compensation for tort victims and protecting the public welfare.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision of the trial court and held that the provisions of the City's Home Rule Charter did not empower the City to require the Board to comply with the City's zoning regulations in the construction and development of the marina. The court held that the municipal zoning ordinances could not control the state's use of its property when it is performing a governmental function.

The police jury appealed from an adverse judgment claiming that the lower court erred: (1) by enjoining it from applying the termination ordinance to plaintiffs; (2) in holding that the form of agreement constituted a &quot;valid written franchise&quot; with the police jury; (3) in failing to reach the issue of the constitutionality of the franchise fee ordinance and; (4) in failing to grant the exception of no right of action as to the claims of each of the individual plaintiffs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former civil employee sued the State for unpaid wages, penalty wages, and attorney's fees, following her discharge. The State had failed to inform the employee that her term of employment had ended, and she was inadvertently allowed to work hours at no pay. The trial court denied the State's exception of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter. The sole issue on appeal was whether the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to render a money judgment in favor of the employee pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:631 et seq. Because her cause of action for unpaid wages, penalty wages, and attorney's fees did not arise until after her discharge, the court held find that it was not an employment related matter subject to the exclusive authority of the State Civil Service Commission. The Commission had no authority to adjudicate this type of dispute. Constitutional provisions, which delegated judicial authority to the Commission, were narrowly construed since they represent exceptions to the general rule that district courts have jurisdiction over all civil matters under La.

The trial court held that the state was not entitled to the statutory rate because it did not plead &sect; 13:5112(C) as an affirmative defense.

The state was not required to plead that judgments against the state were limited by statute because legal interest was not an affirmative defense since it did not have the effect of defeating the suit on the merits. The court also held that &sect; 13:5112(C) did not violate La. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a decision granting an injunction to a city to enjoin the expansion of a nonconforming use by a company and individual, the court reversed and rendered the decision. The location was zoned two-family residential. The nature of the business was selling and leasing construction equipment. The company supplied contractors with equipment. The types of equipment supplied were backhoes, bulldozers, and large equipment. The company argued that it enjoyed an exception of a legal nonconforming use. The city argued that to do so, the business had to meet the same nonconforming use classification enjoyed by its two predecessors. The court considered whether the company's predecessor continued the light industrial use or whether it changed the use to the restrictive use of special industrial. The court held that a zoning ordinance, being in derogation of the rights of private ownership, had to be construed, when it was subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, according to the interpretation which allowed the least restricted use of the property. The company fell within the light industrial classification provided for in the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled in favor of the horse trainer. In reversing, the court held that prior decisions had already found the rules to be constitutional. The horse trainer argued that the rules were not designed to promote safety and did not detect if the drug use occurred during the professional practice. The court found that the government did have a legitimate interest in protecting the integrity of the horse racing industry, along with ensuring its safety. The horse trainer also argued that the rules were arbitrary, with no written procedures, and gave unbridled discretion to the stewards to determine who to test. The court acknowledge that the Louisiana Supreme Court should revisit the constitutionality of the rules, particularly in light of the passage of La. Rev. Stat.

On appeal, defendant raised 29 errors, including 17 allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel against his attorneys. The trial court's judgment was affirmed on appeal. The court found no error in the trial court's determinations that the initial police report had not been altered and that the cocaine used as evidence had not been tampered with. The court also found no evidence, as contended by defendant, that defendant had been coerced or otherwise forced to abandon his right to testify at trial. The court found no error in the sentence handed out by the trial court because the sentence was within the allowable sentencing range and complied with the provisions of La. Rev. Stat.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2612.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer stopped the claimants' vehicle for an expired license tag. The claimants' demeanor aroused suspicion, and the officer obtained permission to search the car. He found beepers, a small scale, and $ 5,530 in cash in one claimant's purse. A check revealed that the claimants had a history of drug-related offenses. The beepers and currency were seized. The district court struck the bond and answer filed by the claimants and the State obtained a default judgment. The district court had authority to strike the bond under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 5123 when it had no proof of the surety's solvency. The answer was then properly stricken under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2612(E). The claimants were not entitled to notice of same. They waived their argument that the forfeiture statute was unconstitutional because they failed to specifically plead such in the district court. The court found that there was sufficient probable cause under the totality of circumstances to justify the seizure as required under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2606(B). The claimants did not meet their burden to prove by a preponderance of evidence that the money came from an independent, non-drug-related source.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the record supported the finding that the city's choices were reasonably related to a public policy-based governmental objective to protect life. The court determined that the chief made discretionary tactical decision, which he should have been able to make without worry about allegations of negligence and the city was immune under the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The first year of each sentence was without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, as required by statute. Defendant appealed the sentences as unconstitutionally excessive. On appeal the court held that defendant's claim was not properly before the court due to defendant's failure to comply with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.1, which provided that a defendant could file a motion to reconsider his sentence within 30 days following imposition of the sentence or within such longer period as the trial court might set at sentencing. Article 881.1(A)(2) required that the motion set forth the specific grounds on which the motion was based.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which convicted him of purse snatching under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:65.1 (1986), and which sentenced him as a second offender under the Louisiana Habitual Offender Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 (1992), to 15 years at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a woman was walking home from a store, defendant pushed her to the ground, grabbed her purse, and ran.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed a disputed claim for compensation with the office of worker's compensation administration. The employee sought compensation benefits and medical expenses for an on-the-job injury to his right hand from an accident. The employer admitted that the accident occurred, but asserted as an affirmative defense that due to claimant's intoxication at the time of the accident that he was not entitled to compensation pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1081. The workmen's compensation hearing officer rendered judgment in favor of the employee and awarded him compensation benefits and medical expenses. The court held that the test results were inadmissible under the statute to prove the employee's use of a controlled substance at the time of the accident; thus, defendants were not entitled to the presumptions that would otherwise apply the statute. The court concluded that the hearing officer was not manifestly erroneous in concluding that the steel company and insurer failed to carry their burden of proving that the employee was intoxicated at the time of the accident, or that the use of marijuana by the employee resulted in intoxication causing the accident.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of carnal knowledge of a juvenile, a violation of La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty and was convicted. On appeal defendant alleged that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:80(A)(1), carnal knowledge of a juvenile, was unconstitutional, and that the trial judge should have granted his motion to quash the bill of information because it excluded females and, therefore, discriminated on the basis of sex and violated the equal protection clauses of the United States and Louisiana Constitutions. On appeal the court held that the protection of young females from pregnancy, and from possible injury to their reproductive systems as well as lingering mental impairment, was a legitimate area of state concern justifying the gender classification involved in the statute. As such, the gender classification in the statute does not violate the Equal Protection Clauses in the Constitutions of the United States or Louisiana. The court also found that that portion of defendant's sentence imposing time in jail if he could not pay the court costs was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1785. The sole assignment of error was the district court's denial of defendant's motion to quash the jury based on the prosecution's alleged discriminatory use of peremptory challenges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged Batson violations. The prosecutor used all six of her available peremptory challenges on African-Americans, after conversing directly with only one of the dismissed jurors. Upon objection, the prosecutor gave four reasons: (1) she is African-American, (2) some dismissed jurors were inattentive, (3) two had either criminal or civil arrest records, and (4) one served on a jury which rendered an acquittal. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the defendant had established a prima facie Batson violation, requiring the State to provide race neutral explanations in rebuttal. The court found the prosecutor's reference to her heritage was merely an assertion of good faith, which alone did not suffice. The court noted that the defense had no notice of arrest records, and none were produced, and neither of venireperson dismissed for that reason expressed any resentment toward the State or police. The court also noted that two white venirepersons also served on acquitting juries, and were not rejected. The court thus found that for three peremptory challenges, the State did not meet its burden.</SPAN></P>

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 930.8. Petitioner also filed a writ of mandamus to obtain his transcribed court record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted and sentenced in 1983. He filed an out-of-time appeal over a year later. The supreme court ultimately ordered the district court to treat the appeal as an application for post-conviction relief and to allow him more time to amend his application. The court amended petitioner's sentence but twice denied his application for writ of mandamus to compel production of transcribed court records. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 930.8 was then enacted, which limited the time for filing for post-conviction relief and allowed a one-year grace period for previously convicted felons to file for such relief. The district court denied petitioner's motion for extension as untimely. The court found that art. 930.8 was not an ex post facto law. It did not alter the definition of the crimes or increase petitioner's punishment. The legislature could shorten the statute of limitations to make application for relief where it provided a reasonable time for petitioner to bring his application. Promulgation of the law was deemed adequate notice to petitioner. Petitioner could seek production of the trial records under the Public Records Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:35.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a corporation, appealed from a decision of the Twenty-Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Charles (Louisiana), which dissolved a restraining order and declared that an ordinance concerning obscenity was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Parish of St. Charles adopted an ordinance that declared illegal the distribution of obscene video material. The corporation filed suit alleging that it was in the business of leasing certain videos which could be determined to be obscene under the terms of the ordinance. The petition alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutional because the specific designation of the relevant community standard from which to judge whether the material was obscene was that of St. Charles Parish. The court held that the reference to St. Charles Parish as the community standard by which to judge what was obscene was illegal and had to be removed from the ordinance. The declared purpose of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106E was to promote uniform obscenity legislation throughout the state and proscribed ordinances which exceed its provisions. The subject ordinance did that, for by declaring with specificity that the standards of St. Charles Parish be applied, it exceeded the general standard of any contemporary community standards. The rest of the ordinance was proper and could be enforced.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2601 et seq. and that the claimant failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the money was not subject to forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state police received information from a customs agent that the claimant would be arriving at the regional airport carrying narcotics or a large sum of money. When the claimant left the airport, a trooper stopped her for a traffic violation. The trooper found a large sum of money after the claimant consented to a search. Upon reconsideration, the court adhered to its original decision to reverse the trial court's judgment. The court concluded that the State did not meet its burden under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2601 et seq. to connect the claimant's money to illegal narcotics violations. The court found no evidence, direct or circumstantial, that connected the claimant to drug trafficking. The evidence connecting the money seized to drug trafficking was based upon the fact of the seizure, the claimant's previous trips out of town, and inferences and conclusions drawn by an expert witness. Although there was testimony that a drug detection dog gave a positive alert to the presence of drug residue, the State did not have the tote bag and money analyzed at a laboratory. The court found more reason to believe that the money was generated by prostitution than by drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to consecutive terms of 21 years at hard labor and life imprisonment without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 15 years old when he shot his parents during the course of a family argument. On appeal the court rejected defendant's numerous claims of error. The court concluded that the failure of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1570 to provide a transfer hearing and a rebuttable presumption in favor of a juvenile remaining under juvenile court jurisdiction did not render the statute unconstitutional. The court also found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress his three statements to the police. The court determined that defendant and his 23-year-old brother signed waiver of rights forms and that defendant's statements were voluntary. Although defendant asserted that he was denied the right to fully present evidence related to long-term mental abuse, the court concluded that under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 651 such evidence was inadmissible because defendant failed to plead not guilty by reason of insanity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Thirtieth Judicial District Court, Parish of Vernon, State of Louisiana, which convicted him based upon a guilty plea to theft and simple escape and sentenced him to serve 37 months at hard labor. Defendant claimed that the sentence was unconstitutionally excessive and unduly harsh because the district court did not properly consider the guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the district court failed to properly consider the guidelines of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. The court found that those sentencing guidelines were no longer in effect when defendant was sentenced on February 24, 1992. Instead, under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.1, defendant had to make or file a motion to reconsider his sentence, based upon a specific ground such as excessiveness, within 30 days of its imposition, or he could not argue that ground or object to the sentence on appeal or review. Defendant had objected to the sentence at the sentencing hearing, but he had not filed a motion to reconsider his sentence. The record was prepared 30 days after sentencing, so he was precluded from raising the claim of excessiveness on appeal. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.1 was to become effective on January 1, 1992, or 30 days after the effective date of the sentencing guidelines, whichever was later. Under an emergency rule, the sentencing guidelines had become effective on January 1, 1992. Therefore, art. 881.1 became effective 30 days later on January 30, 1992, and defendant's assignment of error was not properly before the court on appeal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the conviction and sentence for distribution of cocaine because the trial court was found to have erred in failing to grant a mistrial or admonish the jury based on the district attorney's statement in closing argument which told the jury that they could convict defendant of distribution to two individuals, even though the bill of particulars specifically stated that the cocaine was distributed to only one of those two individuals. Although testimony was introduced at trial as to the distribution to the other individual, the court found hat the scope of the indictment should not have been widened without an amendment to the indictment. Defendant's conviction for possession with intent to distribute was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested as a result of an undercover police operation. At trial, two police officers both identified defendant as the man who sold the heroin to another officer. Defendant denied he sold heroin to the officer and testified that while he was a heroin user, he preferred to steal and not deal drugs to support his habit. Defendant was convicted and sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court rejected defendant's argument that a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification was created by a suggestive identification procedure and unreliable identification testimony. The court held that testimony concerning an out of court identification was permissible to support in-court identification. The court found that based on the testimony of all three officers, it could not be concluded that their identifications of defendant were unreliable. The court ruled that defendant had not received ineffective assistance of counsel because ineffectiveness claims which fell within the ambit of trial strategy did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted of aggravated rape, aggravated kidnapping, and armed robbery, appealed the sentences imposed by the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which ordered defendant to serve 40 years at hard labor on the rape conviction, life imprisonment on the kidnapping conviction, and seven years at hard labor on the robbery conviction, but without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant jumped into a woman's car and directed her to drive to a vacant lot where he produced a knife and raped her. The victim was then forced to go to her automatic teller machine, withdraw money, and give it to him. Upon defendant's conviction of aggravated rape, aggravated kidnapping, and simple armed robbery, defendant challenged his sentencing. The court refused to entertain defendant's contention that the statute under which his mandatory life sentence for kidnapping was imposed, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:44, was unconstitutional, as he did not raise his constitutional challenge in the trial court. The court also rejected defendant's assertion that the maximum sentences he received for the rape and simple robbery convictions were excessive. Recognizing the seriousness of the offenses, the court refused to disturb the term of the sentences imposed, noting defendant's previous attempted rape conviction, and that the judge acted within the guidelines set by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. However, the restriction against parole, probation, or suspension violated the sentencing provision of the robbery statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:65B and needed to be vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the sentence imposed on defendant for simple robbery, vacating that portion ordering that the sentence be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, but affirmed the judgment in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Disguised as police officers, defendants stopped the victims, conducted a search, and misappropriated money under the guise of searching the victims and the vehicle for drugs. They were charged with and convicted of attempted simple robbery and simple robbery. They appealed their convictions, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and the sentence imposed. In affirming, the court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions where the defendants misrepresented themselves as police officers, ordered the victims from their vehicle, and used intimidation in attempting to take and actually taking valuables from the victims. The victims were clearly intimidated by the display of a badge, the threat of trouble, and a general demeanor and aura of authority. Further, the sentence imposed was not unconstitutionally excessive. Although one of the defendants had no prior record, he had an extensive arrest record, including a prior arrest for impersonating a police officer. Because the trial court determined that defendants would likely commit other offenses if not incarcerated, there was not error in concluding that a need existed for a corrective environment.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:981.3 and 40:967 for distribution of cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of selling cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school. He contended that the definition of school property in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:981.3 was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that &sect; 40:981.3 was clearly and readily understandable, gave adequate notice of what conduct was proscribed, and provided adequate standards for determining the guilt or innocence of the accused. Any reasonable person could understand that &sect; 40.981.3 proscribed trafficking controlled dangerous substances while on or within 1,000 feet of school property, and the statute's definition of school property clearly encompassed the school property involved in the case. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the statute was overbroad. Section 40:981.3 did not violate the equal protection clause by not making an exception for periods when school was not in session because the legislature had a legitimate goal of protecting school age children from the dangers of drugs and drug related crime and &sect; 40:981.3 was rationally structured to effectuate that purpose. Section 40:981.3(E)(1) was not ambiguous. The court reduced defendant's sentence to give him credit for time served.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but amended his sentence to reflect credit for time served.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' 13-month old daughter died in of wasting and nutritional deprivation. Defendant mother had been entitled to receive government-provided health care services and food for the child, but did not avail herself of those services. Defendants were convicted of manslaughter under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:31A(2)(a) for unintentionally causing the child's death while engaged in perpetrating a felony, and were sentenced to serve 21 years at hard labor. The court held that the predicate felony of cruelty to juveniles supported the convictions under &sect; 14:31A(2)(a), and that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because any person of reasonable intelligence was able to understand it. The mother's motion to withdraw a plea of guilty, and to plead not guilty by reason of insanity, was properly denied as untimely. Accordingly, evidence relating to the mother's mental condition was properly excluded, as it was not relevant to the mother's defense, and could not relieve the father of his duty to see that his children were properly cared for.

The trial judge's failure to sustain defense objections did not constitute reversible error, and defendant showed no prejudice as a result of the trial court's ruling on his counsel's opening statement.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to a charge of vehicular homicide, reserving his right to seek review of pretrial motions.

The fact it did not require the State to obtain two blood samples at separate time intervals to more accurately determine a defendant's blood alcohol level at the time defendant was operating the motor vehicle was not a violation of due process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, ship operator and insurance company appealed the judgment of the Twenty-Third Judicial District Court, Parish of St .James (Louisiana), which held that they were liable to plaintiff boatswain for an injury he received while working on a ship.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The boatswain was working on a ship when an accident occurred damaging his leg. The boatswain sued the ship operator and his insurance company under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.S. &sect; 688, and unseaworthiness. The trial court found in favor of the boatswain, and an appeal was taken. The court held that the trial court correctly refused to hold a jury trial, because only the boatswain in an admiralty case could request trial by jury. The court also determined that the boatswain successfully proved that his injury was caused by the ship's unseaworthiness, and therefore he was entitled to recovery under negligence and the Jones Act, because the ship operator failed to properly train or supervise the ship employees. In addition, the court observed that the boatswain was entitled to future medical expenses, but prejudgment interest on the award was unavailable. Finally, the court concluded that the boatswain was not entitled to recovery for the amount of money that the ship operator would have spent on the boatswain if he actually lived on the ship, because he failed to present any loss. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the unmarried partner of a testator, appealed from a judgment of the 16th Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. Martin, State of Louisiana, which denied her request to annul the testament based on the subsequent birth of an illegitimate child to the testator, pursuant to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1705. Article 1705 provided that a testament was revoked by the birth of an illegitimate child only under certain conditions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testator was divorced. He lived with his new partner after his divorce, but never married her. His partner gave birth to a child less than one year before the testator's death. In an olographic will, made 18 years before his death, the testator left a portion of his estate to his former wife. Following the testator's death, a court order recognized the testator as the father of the partner's son. In her action seeking to annul the testament, the partner contended that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1705 was unconstitutional because it provided that a testament was revoked by the subsequent birth of a legitimate child but did not provide revocation by the subsequent birth of an illegitimate child, except on certain conditions. On appeal, the court noted that classifications based on illegitimacy were not suspect. The court found that the classification based on illegitimacy was based on a legitimate state interest because the difficulty in proof of legitimacy constituted a permissible state interest. Therefore, the court concluded that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the district court and assessed all costs of the appeal to the partner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife filed a medical malpractice action against defendants after the husband contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion and later transmitted it to the wife. The husband subsequently died. The district court granted an exception of prescription filed by the hospital. The wife filed a motion for new trial, requested a Sibley hearing, and argued that the district court had granted the exception without allowing her an opportunity to amend her petition. The district court denied the motion and issued an amended judgment maintaining the exception of prescription. The wife appealed and argued the constitutionality of the statute of limitations. The court vacated the amended judgement because a substantive change was made, and it reversed the original judgment because it did not give the wife time to amend. The court held that the district court erred in failing to rule on the constitutional issue and in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing as requested by the wife. The court also set aside an order which granted an exception filed by the laboratory, based on the rulings related to the other judgments.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with and convicted of simple robbery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:65. He appealed his conviction and sentence, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence. In reversing, the court concluded that the defendant was not guilty of simple robbery, and the appropriate charge was theft of property, which was not a responsive verdict to simple robbery. The defendant engaged in no force or intimidation, which was necessary for a robbery conviction, and the court rejected the State's argument that a victim could be intimidated by a look in a perpetrator's eye. While the defendant cheated and defrauded the tourist, he did not commit simple robbery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The basis of the State's exception was that the taxpayer failed to pay the tax under protest and failed to follow payment with a timely suit for a refund.

The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, finding that under the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1576, a pre-requisite to the taxpayer's exercise of access to the trial court was that the taxpayer had paid under protest. The court found that the taxpayer, who paid without protest and whose claim was rejected by the Board of Tax Appeals for the State of Louisiana, had exhausted his remedies, was barred by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1846 from appealing the rejection, and was barred from a trial de novo by his own failure to satisfy the requisites of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1576. Further, the court rejected the taxpayer's claim of right of action under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2301 et seq., finding that the cited articles did not apply to a claim by a taxpayer against a taxing authority for a refund. The court dismissed the taxpayer's suit.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the Department had failed to follow the procedure imposed by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:957.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parish police juries applied, and the Department issued a water-quality certification for a watershed project. The Department's secretary denied any requested post-issuance relief, and the mayor and parish council sought review in the trial court, which reversed the certification. On appeal, the court found that the reversal was based on La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:957, which required that as the assistant secretary that issued the certification did not hear the case or read the record, the parties had to be served with a proposed order, and the opportunity had to be afforded to adversely affected parties to respond to the proposed order; this was not done. Based on the facts, the court found that &sect; 49:957 mandated that the proposed order be served and that the police juries, the mayor, and the parish council be given the opportunity to file exceptions, submit briefs, and make oral argument to the assistant secretary before he made his decision. The court also ruled that the hearing officer's apparent consideration- -no matter how minimal- -of aerial-survey information was erroneous because the record showed that no aerial-survey information had been admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the doctor did not argue that he was not an &quot;employing unit&quot; subject to the Louisiana Employment Security Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1471 et seq. Rather, he argued that the routine practice of random audits by the Department of individual citizens' private papers violated U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court affirmed the judgment ordering him to comply with the administrative subpoena and held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1660 could be constitutionally applied to an unincorporated individual. The records required to be kept pursuant to &sect; 23:1660 had a public aspect for purposes of constitutional analysis and were not private papers entitled to the protection of U.S. Const. amends.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bus driver filed a suit for declaratory judgment, contending that the statute upon which her discharge was based was unconstitutional. The school board joined in her request that the injunction be issued until a declaratory judgment was entered recognizing that theft was not a ground upon which a removal proceeding could be based. The trial court issued a restraining order to the school board prohibiting any further proceedings. The trial court then heard from the parties, and found the statute constitutional and denied the bus driver injunctive relief. The trial court vacated the prior injunction order. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court judgments, stating that the trial court had applied the correct legal principles to the issue presented. The court agreed that the statute under which the bus driver's employment could be terminated, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:493, was constitutional because there was a governmental importance and objective in the school board ensuring that its employees who came into contact with children were of good moral character and influence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for armed robbery and aggravated burglary. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The trial court properly required defendant to reveal his gold tooth to the jury because the victim described her assailants, specifically testified as to the gold tooth, but failed to positively identify defendant. Thus, the evidence was admissible under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 401, 402 because defendant's identity was a fact of consequence and whether he had a gold tooth was relevant to the identity issue. Furthermore, requiring a defendant to exhibit identifying characteristics was demonstrative evidence and not violative of the Fifth Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination. Defendant's sentence was not excessive because the trial court adequately articulated the factors that it considered in imposing the sentence under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. The trial court considered defendant's prior felony convictions and acts that involved guns and violence, his young age, the fact that he came from a broken home, and that because of financial difficulty his family was forced to live in a high crime area.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted the phraseology that the crime of obstruction of justice is any of the following when committed with the knowledge that such act has, reasonably may, or will affect an actual or potential present, past, or future criminal proceeding was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that a statute was unconstitutionally vague if it did not give individual adequate notice that certain conduct was proscribed and punishable by law, and if it did not provide adequate standards for those charged with determining the accused's guilt or innocence. Here, defendant claimed the term &quot;affect&quot; was vague because it presumed an adverse effect and was not modified by the necessary adverbs to clarify the statute's intent. That argument construed &quot;affect&quot; out of context however, and overlooked the fact that the statute required that an offender act with the specific intent of distorting the results of any criminal investigation or proceeding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board operated an airport and the rental car companies, which were located off-site, picked up customers at the airport. The board adopted a resolution requiring off-site rental car companies to pay a privilege fee for the privilege of access to the airport to conduct business at the airport. The city filed a declaratory judgment action, which was joined by the rental car companies, alleging that the privilege fee imposed by board was an unconstitutional, illegal, invalid, and unenforceable tax. The trial court granted the preliminary injunction and the board sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the permit fee agreement clearly violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2:605D because &sect; 2:605D only permitted imposition of a fee that was fair, reasonable, and not unjustly discriminatory. The court found that &sect; 2:065D specifically forbid the fees from having the effect of substantially lessening competition and mandated that the fees be based on cost to the airport of the particular facilities or services used by the offsite companies.

Therefore, the mortgage holder had not met the burden of proof that the sale was invalid for failure to afford proper notice to the mortgage holder pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2180.1. The court also found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2180.1B(2) prohibited annulment of a tax sale due to lack of notice to the mortgagee.

He was tried by a jury for one count of distribution of cocaine within 1000 feet of a school and was found guilty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The transaction occurred after school hours. One of the officers present testified that it was about 7:45 p.m., that it was dark outside, and that only adults were present. However, the evidence was clear that defendant distributed cocaine outside in a parking lot. The court affirmed the judgment of his conviction and sentence. In response to the challenge raised by defendant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:981.3, the court opined that the application of the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad. Further, the court found that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt the existence and location of the school zone, and that the transactions occurred within 1000 feet of the school property. The court found that such question was for the jury to decide, and that the jury was free to believe the civil engineering expert, who testified as to his opinion of the official boundary of the school property. Finally, from the testimony of the officers who purchased the drug and transported it to the crime lab, and the chemist who analyzed and identified the cocaine, the state established the chain of custody of the alleged crack cocaine beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the minute entry was admissible to prove defendant's prior conviction. The portion of the minute which mentioned a firearm was extraneous but did not cause such prejudice to require a mistrial. Second, the court held that the trial court had great discretion in determining whether the state established a proper chain of custody and that the trial court's finding was not an abuse of discretion. Third, the court held that the trial court's sentence of eight years at hard labor was within the statutory limits for the crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case was before the court by writ of certiorari on remand from the Louisiana Supreme Court. The writ application concerned the request for payment of reasonable attorney's fees and expenses filed by relator attorneys, who were appointed to represent indigent defendants charged with murder. During the criminal prosecution, motions for payment of compensation and expenses were filed. The writ arose from the denial of the payment request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case turned on the violation of the attorneys' rights to substantive due process, which protected against an oppressive interpretation of the law and which was, in many ways, similar to the La. Const. art. I, &sect; 4 &quot;taking&quot; clause. The court appointments, from a non-voluntary list, to defend a person charged with a capital offense without compensation was, in itself, onerous and oppressive. Given the extreme nature of the burden of a capital case appointment, it was unrealistic to conclude otherwise. Involvement in a capital case required the attorney to forego profitable employment. The attorneys' involvement directly and adversely impacted on the attorneys' financial resources. Furthermore, a capital case placed the most demands on the attorneys' skills and time. Although there was no evidence as to the total number of hours devoted to the case, the guilty pleas were not accepted until a significant time after appointment. Therefore, not compensating the attorneys constituted an abusive extension of their professional obligations, so the Indigent Defender Board was ordered to compensate them for the maximum amount paid to appointed voluntary attorneys.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's denial of the motion for reasonable compensation was reversed. It was ordered that the Indigent Defender Board pay the attorneys the maximum amount allowable according to law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action filed by plaintiff against defendant Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association (LIGA) seeking a declaration of the validity of a consent judgment, the City Court, Alexandria Ward, Rapides Parish, Louisiana, held the judgment was valid and enforceable. The trial court made an alternative ruling that if its ruling was reversed, then the statute under which LIGA had proceeded was unconstitutional. LIGA appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">LIGA, which chose to contest the consent judgment, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1382(A)(4), alleged that: (1) the settlement was not authorized by an insurer, and (2) the settlement was excessive and not supported by medical evidence. The trial judge maintained plaintiff's exception of no cause of action, but overruled her exception of res judicata. The instant court concluded that the allegations asserted by LIGA, even if true, did not constitute grounds for nullity. Thus, the trial court correctly maintained plaintiff's exception of no cause of action. Regarding the constitutionality of &sect; 22:1382(A)(4), the instant court observed that LIGA could not simply refuse to pay a judgment upon its own unilateral review of the settlement or release upon which a judgment was based. The statute did not grant LIGA that right. Because the operation of &sect; 22:1382(A)(4) did not deprive plaintiff of her property without due process of law, the statute did not violate the due process clause of the United States or Louisiana Constitutions. Judgment in favor of plaintiff was premature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case was remanded for a full trial on the merits. The instant court affirmed the trial court's decision maintaining plaintiff's exception of no cause of action. However, the trial court erred in finding the statute unconstitutional. Costs of the appeal were to be paid by LIGA to the extent allowed by law.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that there was jurisdiction over the husband, who was living in Florida when the rule was filed, since service of process was made pursuant to La. Rev. Stat.

In affirming the judgment, the court held the state had sufficient minimum contacts with the husband to establish jurisdiction over him for the purpose of awarding alimony pursuant to &sect; 13:3201A(6) because he formerly resided in the state with the wife. The court further held that the trial court was correct in awarding alimony to the wife. The court stated that the husband could raise the issue of the wife's fault at the hearing on the rule even though he filed no answer asserting fault on her part as an affirmative defense. After a review of the record, including the husband's proffer of proof, the court found that there was no evidence in the record of fault on the wife's part that would preclude her from receiving permanent alimony.</SPAN></P>

The daughter's eye was bleeding as a result of her beating, and the daughter had multiple healing wounds and scars on her back and extremities. Thus, the evidence supported the conviction and the sentence was not excessive. Pursuant to La. Code Evid. arts. 607(C) and 403, the trial court properly limited defendant's right under La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which convicted him of attempted simple burglary, and which sentenced him under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's fingerprints were found on an office safe that had been pried open and paper towels with defendant's blood type were found in the office. As a result, defendant was convicted of attempted simple burglary and sentenced as a habitual offender to 12 years at hard labor without benefit of probation, suspension of sentence, parole, or good time. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction but modified the sentence to allow defendant the benefit of parole and good time. Defendant's counsel was not ineffective for not filing a motion to suppress the evidence taken from the office, because under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 703, only unconstitutionally seized evidence could be suppressed. Under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 806, the trial court properly declined to instruct the jury on whether defendant was left or right handed, because the issue was a fact of the case. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 did not prohibit parole, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:571.3 permitted defendant to earn good time. Therefore the judgment was proper, but the sentence had to be amended to allow parole and good time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment which convicted defendant of attempted simple burglary, and which sentenced him as a habitual offender to 12 years at hard labor without probation or suspension of sentence. The court modified the sentence to allow defendant the benefit of parole and good time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were traveling in two boats on the Intracoastal Waterway when an agent of the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries stopped them. Agents of the department were conducting game violation and boat safety checks in that location. The agent recognized one of the defendants as someone he knew had past hunting violations. The agent saw a buck head in the boat, and a fully dressed and quartered deer that had not been tagged. Defendants were charged with possession of untagged deer meat, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:125(B). After hearing testimony, the trial court denied defendants' motions to suppress evidence and statements and they sought review on a writ of certiorari. The court reversed the denial of the motions to suppress, holding that the stop of defendants' boats was conducted illegally under the La. Const., art. I, &sect; v. The court concluded that reasonable suspicion did not support the stop and that the limitations on sobriety roadblocks were also applicable to the State's random stops for game violation checks. The illegality of the initial stop required suppression of the resulting evidence and statements.</SPAN></P>

The third party admitted paternity and the parties entered into a consent judgment which awarded appellant $ 420,000 for past, present and future support of the child. While the child support/paternity action was ongoing, appellee State was proceeding against the third party for violations of the drug racketeering act. The State obtained a writ of seizure and while attempting to execute it, the State learned appellant had seized some assets under the support judgment. The trial court declared the support judgment null and void. The court noted that appellant and the third party lived together and during that time appellant was the bookkeeper for the third party's company. Appellant was aware of the drug activities and benefited from them. The court noted that the lump sum figure of $ 2,000 per month was for a child who was not yet 2 years old at the time of the filing of the suit, and was an excessive amount under ordinary circumstances. The trial court did not abuse its great discretion when it concluded that the support judgment was rendered through &quot;fraud or ill practice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendant's post-conviction motion to correct an illegally lenient sentence and resentenced him to 45 years at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence and with credit for time served. Defendant appealed. The court held that, absent an allegation of prejudice, defendant was not denied the right to the assistance of counsel under La. Const. art.

The court held that the correction of the sentence was not unconstitutional or unfair, particularly because defendant raised the issue that his sentence was illegally lenient.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant permit applicant appealed from the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which dismissed its petition to review a permit denial by appellee, department of environmental quality (DEQ), for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. At issue was the retroactivity of an amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:2024(A) vesting jurisdiction in the trial court to conduct a de novo review of DEQ permit decisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DEQ denied the applicant's application for a permit to construct a solid waste landfill. The applicant contended that &sect; 30:2024 was unconstitutional because it vested jurisdiction to review DEQ actions directly in the appellate court, thereby bypassing the trial court. The court found that the provision vesting jurisdiction in the trial court to review the DEQ's action was a procedural one because it prescribed a method of enforcing a right of judicial review of an administrative decision which previously existed. This provision in no way impaired vested rights; it merely changed the forum in which the applicant could exercise its previously existing right of judicial review. Further, the vesting of subject matter jurisdiction to entertain an appeal in the trial court did not effect a change in the substantive law which gave an aggrieved party the right of judicial review of adverse administrative decisions. Moreover, the provision requiring the trial court to conduct a de novo review was a remedial and procedural provision entitled to retroactive application because it changed the form of the judicial review proceeding to be conducted in the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the matter to the trial court to conduct a de novo review of the DEQ's denial of the applicant's permit application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employer hired an independent contractor to perform drilling work on a barge. An explosion prematurely occurred during a wireline perforating, and two employees were injured, while another died. A lawsuit was brought against the employer and the drilling companies.

The court held that admiralty law did not apply, because even though the accident occurred on a barge that was in navigable waters, the drilling did not involve maritime nexus, and was an activity related to the oil and gas industry. The court also determined that the employer could not avoid liability on the grounds that the explosion was incurred by an independent contractor, because the employer could not avoid liability for an ultrahazardous duty, such as wireline perforating. In addition, the court observed that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the admission of videos of the employers receiving treatment because it was not prejudicial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, who was a flagman, was injured when the truck improperly changed lanes into a construction zone and ran into equipment owned by the road construction company that was the employer. Plaintiffs brought an action against the truck owner. Subsequently, plaintiffs petitioned the trial court for a declaratory judgment as to the proper apportionment of the insurance proceeds. The trial court rendered a declaratory judgment in favor of the employee, giving him preference in payment from the insurance proceeds for his general damages before the insurer could recover any reimbursement. The insurer sought review arguing that the trial judge erred, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1103, in rendering a declaratory judgment holding that the employee would receive all sums awarded him for his non-economic damages arising from the accident in preference to payment of reimbursement to it. On appeal, the court reversed and rendered the judgment. The court held that the 1989 amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1103(B) was interpretive and retroactive. The court found that the trial court erred in failing to apply the 1989 amended statute, thus, the insurer was entitled to recover.</SPAN></P>

The main issue presented in the appeal was whether the Commission erred in summarily disposing of portions of the appeal prior to a public hearing on the merits by concluding that some allegations by the employees either had not been pled with sufficient factual detail or was not a violation of La.

The court noted that the allegations of discriminatory treatment were not supported by any facts and that the allegations, as pleaded, were conclusory and failed to allege sufficient detail as required by Civ. Serv. R. 13.11(d). The court held that the allegations that the layoff plan was approved too quickly and that the Department of Civil Service had failed to issue appropriate orders to insure that the layoffs were fair satisfied the pleading requirements of Rule 13.11(d) and reversed the Commission's summary disposition of those issues. The court found no merit in the allegations relative to a duty to review outside agency contracts. The court found that the allegations that the layoff plan failed to address the budgetary measures taken to avoid the layoff was preserved for a hearing on the merits.

</DIV>

The court noted that the natural father failed to raise the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2422.1 in the juvenile court and failed to join the attorney general. The court held that the evidence supported the determination that the adoption was in the best interests of the child. There was no error in the finding that the stepfather was well suited as a prospective adoptive parent. Also, the court held that any meaningful parenting bond that existed between the natural father and the child had dissipated prior to the filing of the adoption petition. Further, the court found that the juvenile court properly considered evidence of the natural father's misconduct that occurred after the petition was filed. The testimony was offered as additional proof of the nonexistence of a parent-child relationship between the natural father and the child. The testimony did not expand the pleadings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee operated an after-hours club and allowed patrons to bring in alcohol beverages. Patrons 18 and older entered for a cover charge. After several months of operation under an occupational license, the municipality informed the licensee that the business violated Ordinance 14:63 and would be closed down if it continued to operate. In affirming, the court noted that there was no fundamental right or suspect class involved that required heightened scrutiny of the ordinance. The police testified that there was an increase in both criminal activity and the number of arrests in the area of the club, and that minors were arrested on the club's premises. The court found that the ordinance was rationally related to the legitimate government objectives of reducing alcohol consumption by minors and crimes committed by intoxicated persons, and protecting minors from the corrupting influences of older patrons. Thus, the ordinance was constitutional under substantive due process and equal protection analyses. Further, the ordinance was designed to accomplish a purpose and properly fell within the scope of the municipality's police power. Finally, the ordinance was not broad or vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court at the licensee's costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred by granting the state's challenge for cause and by imposing an excessive sentence. The court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting a challenge for cause directed to a juror who testified that she had known defendant most of her life and knew his sisters &quot;real well.&quot; The court found that the record clearly indicated that the prospective juror's relationship with defendant and his family could have influenced his verdict. Although the juror had not had any contact with defendant for 10 years, she testified that it would be hard for her to be fair and impartial as a juror. Under the circumstances, the court concluded that the trial court properly granted the challenge pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 797. The court determined that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, the maximum sentence that defendant could have received as a second offender was 12 years.

The court held that defendant's sale of the two ounces of cocaine to the investigator, and the paraphernalia for distribution, consisting of the baggies, the metric scale, and the walkie-talkies, was sufficient evidence to support the inference of the intent to distribute cocaine. Defendant did not raise properly the issue of the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:130.1 in the trial court either by way of a motion to quash under La. Code Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a classified civil service employee, insisted upon the fiscally irresponsible actions of delaying recoupment of state funds and issuing a check to a vendor without the proper authorization in spite of contrary advice by his fiscal officers.

In particular, the court held that La. Civ. Serv. R. 1.40 and 12.2 did not contravene La. Const. art. X, &sect; 8(A). The court next held that La. Civ. Serv. R. 13.15, 13.17, and 13.18 did not infringe impermissible on the employee's due process right to a speedy resolution of his case. The court also held that the essentials of due process were met in the pre-deprivation proceedings. The court further held that the Commission had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the employee's invasion of privacy and defamation claims. The court held that the Commission's decision was not arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State Board of Dentistry challenged a judgment of the 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) to the extent it found venue proper in East Baton Rouge Parish in appellee dentist's action to recover costs for administrative proceedings under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:965.1 after fines and discipline against him were overturned by the Louisiana Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dentist was the subject of disciplinary action that resulted in fines and suspension. He appealed, and the case was ultimately heard by the Louisiana Supreme Court which found in his favor. He thereafter filed an action to recover costs and attorney's fees under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13:5101, and 13:5104, and the Board filed a change of venue motion under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:964(B) of the Louisiana Administrative Procedure Act, seeking venue in Orleans Parish, where the Board had its offices and was therefore domiciled. The trial court denied the request, holding that because the dentist and the witnesses were largely in East Baton Rouge Parish, venue was proper there. The board appealed, and the court reversed and remanded for transfer. The court held that because his claim for litigation expenses was brought under the authority of the Act, it should have been filed in the district court of the parish in which the agency was located, and the trial court erred in denying the Board's requested change of venue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant proprietor sought review of a judgment from the 21st Judicial District Court, Livingston Parish (Louisiana), which granted plaintiff parish police jury a preliminary injunction prohibiting the proprietor from operating a salvage yard site without a permit and in violation of Livingston Parish, La., Code &sect; 10-8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parish police jury brought suit against the proprietor seeking injunctive relief from his alleged violation of Livingston Parish, La., Code &sect; 10-8 governing the establishment and operation of automobile salvage yards. The trial court granted the parish police jury a preliminary injunction, which enjoined the proprietor from operating a salvage yard site without a permit and in violation of &sect; 10-8. The proprietor contended that &sect; 10-8 was unconstitutionally vague, overly broad, and indefinite. On appeal, the court determined that the parish police jury had no right of action and reversed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the parish police jury was a creature and a subordinate political subdivision of the state, and, as such, possessed only those powers conferred upon it by the state's constitution and statutes. The court ruled that the parish police jury had no right to enforce its ordinance with an injunction because there was no constitutional or statutory authority for it to do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court that granted the parish police jury a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>
