<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to quash the indictment and the challenge to the array. The court found that the jury commissioners succeeded in fulfilling their duty to familiarize themselves fairly with the qualifications of the eligible jurors of the county without regard to race and color. There was no evidence of a studied attempt to include or exclude a specified number of Negroes. On the contrary, there was a studied and forthright attempt to review the names of all prospective jurors, Negroes and whites, and include or exclude them as jurors according to their qualifications as individuals and not as members of a racial group. The court held that Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 59-106, 92-6307, which required that the names of grand jurors were to be chosen from the tax digest and that the names of whites and Negroes were placed in separate places in the tax digest, respectively, were not violative of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the term &quot;vandalism&quot; applied only to acts that resulted in an injury to property, not to bodily injuries that were unaccompanied by injuries to property. Finally, the court refused to consider the father's attack on the constitutionality of &sect; 105-113 because &sect; 105-113 was not applicable to the father and therefore, his rights were not affected by it.</SPAN></P>

The commissioners contended that although the municipality had adopted regulations that provided for grants of liquor licenses pursuant to that statute, they had been repealed, and filed general demurrers to the writ. The trial court issued the writ and denied the general demurrers. The court affirmed on the ground that although the statute, which legalized the sale of alcoholic beverages, vested the commissioners with wide discretion in the regulation of businesses that had been authorized to sell liquor, they were not vested with the authority to prohibit such sales. The court found that because the repealing ordinance issued by the commissioners made the manufacture or sale of alcoholic beverages prohibited, they had attempted to frustrate the intent of the statute and exceeded their authority. The court held that mandamus was the proper remedy in the matter because the issue involved a public right or enforcement of a duty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayer filed an action against defendant city-county board of tax assessors, seeking a declaratory judgment that the board was not legally constituted and that the board acted without legal authority in assessing taxes against the taxpayer, and seeking an injunction prohibiting the board from collecting assessed taxes. The board filed general demurrers. The Fulton Superior Court (Georgia) overruled the demurrers. The board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer leased property for a railroad operation. Each year, the taxpayer returned the property for an assessment of taxes to the State. For three tax years after the board was created, the taxpayer failed to return the property to the city and county for an assessment of taxes. The board assessed an ad valorem tax against the taxpayer for the taxpayer's failure to return the property for assessment by the board. On appeal, the court determined that 1952 Ga. Laws 2825 was not unconstitutional. The court found that the legislature's adoption of the law before an amendment to the Georgia Constitution was ratified by the people did not constitute an ex post facto law as the effective date of the law depended upon ratification of the constitutional amendment and was after such ratification. The court concluded that the constitutional amendment was submitted by the Governor of Georgia in the proper form. The court determined, therefore, that the board was legally constituted and that the board acted with legal authority in assessing taxes against the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everette H. Acrey, a citizen, property owner and taxpayer of the City of Cornelia, brought this equitable suit in Habersham Superior Court against Ralston Purina Company, Inc., seeking to enjoin the defendant's alleged violation of a zoning ordinance of the City of Cornelia.  The petition alleged that the Mayor and City Council of Cornelia adopted the zoning ordinance on June 4, 1962; that the defendant maintains, uses and operates a rendering plant located in an industrial zone within 400 yards of the plaintiff's home which is located in a residential zone; that the defendant completed construction of the rendering plant in November, 1963, and within a few days thereafter commenced operation of the plant; that the defendant has been operating the plant 24 hours a day, five days a week, since commencing; that the defendant daily brings to its plant the offal from approximately 180,000 chickens and processes and reduces the offal by cooking and pulverizing various portions into meal and by rendering it to produce large quantities of fats and oils; that such process gives off offensive and obnoxious odors; that more than&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  100 dwelling houses are within one-fourth mile of such illegally operated plant and unless equity intervenes a multiplicity of suits will result; that the operation and maintenance of the plant as described is violative of certain portions of the city's zoning ordinance; that the plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law and is entitled under Georgia law and specifically Ga. L. 1946, pp. 191, 202 (Code Ann. &sect; 69-839), to equitable relief in the form of temporary and permanent injunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pertinent provisions of the zoning ordinance are attached as an exhibit to the petition.  The enacting clause sets out that the city commission &quot;deems it necessary in order to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire panic and other dangers; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land, to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate provisions of transportation, water sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements and otherwise to promote the public safety, health, convenience and general welfare in accordance with a comprehensive plan.&quot; The ordinance recites that it was adopted &quot;in pursuance of the authority granted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the Charter of Cornelia as amended by the Act approved March 9, 1959 (Ga. L. 1959, p. 2178), as amended.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the purposes of the ordinance are: &quot;to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water sewerage, schools, parks, and other public requirements; to sustain the stability of neighborhoods; to protect property against blight and depreciation; to secure economy in governmental expenditure; to conserve the value of buildings; to encourage the most appropriate use of land and buildings . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the provisions relating to industrial districts the ordinance states that the following uses are prohibited within an I (Industrial) Zone: distillation of bones; garbage, offal, dead animal reduction or dumping; rendering or refining of fats and oils; any other use that is noxious or offensive by reason of the emission or creation of odor, dust, fumes, smoke, gas, noise, vibration or similar substances or conditions which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the opinion of the planning commission would be detrimental to the community interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant demurred to the petition on the following grounds: that the petition sets forth no cause of action; that the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief sought; that the zoning ordinance upon which relief is sought is null and void because the 1959 Act, supra, upon which it is based contravenes Art. I, Sec. IV, Par. I of the Georgia Constitution (Code Ann. &sect; 2-401) since the 1959 Act is a special law for which provision had been made by a general law, Ga. L. 1946, p. 191; that it affirmatively appears from the petition that the City of Cornelia has not elected to come within the provisions of the 1946 Act; that the zoning ordinance is null and void because the special law upon which it is based contravenes Art. III, Sec. VII, Par. VIII of the Georgia Constitution (Code Ann. &sect; 2-1908) in that it contains matter different from that expressed in the title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge overruled all the grounds of the defendant's demurrer, to which judgment exception is taken.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant rendering plant appealed the judgment of the Habersham Superior Court (Georgia), which overruled all grounds of its demurrer in plaintiff property owner's action that sought to enjoin the plant's alleged violation of a city zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The plant claimed that it had commenced its operations that were sought to have been enjoined almost a year and a half after the adoption of the zoning ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that it was incumbent upon one seeking to have used property for a nonconforming use after a rezoning ordinance to have shown that his prior use of the property was legal and not unlawful. The court ruled that even a nonconforming use would not have been protected unless it appeared that it was lawful at its inception. The matter was within the province of defensive pleadings and the property owner was not required to negative the possible defense. Additionally, the court found that the plant's general demurrer asserting that no cause of action was set forth had not raised the question whether the property owner was barred by laches and that because no ground upon which the doctrine of laches might have been applied appeared affirmatively from the allegations of the petition, it was not subject to demurrer. The court concluded that the ordinance was within the terms of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 69-835, which gave full power to cities to adopt zoning ordinances for certain specified purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the property owner in his action that sought to enjoin the plant's alleged violation of a city zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Injunction.  Cobb Superior Court.  Before Judge Manning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clifford Frasure and W. J. Brackett filed their petition against the Ordinary of Cobb County and alleged: The petitioners own real property and reside in the area of the alleged city limits of the City of Elizabeth.  Under the provisions of an act of 1964 (Ga. L. 1964, Ex. Sess., pp. 2179-2201) the defendant is required to hold an election on the first Tuesday in October, 1964, for approval or rejection of the provisions of the act, which act attempts to amend, revise, and supersede an act incorporating the Town of Elizabeth in Cobb County, approved October 8, 1885 (Ga. L. 1885, p. 377).  The 1885 act required the election of a mayor and five councilmen within six months or as soon as practicable.  There has never been an election or any action of any type to effectuate the act of 1885.  Citizens in the area embraced therein have never paid any taxes, no city officials have been elected or appointed, and no city services of any nature have been performed.  The charter of the Town of Elizabeth has been abandoned, no attempt having been made to activate it for 79 years.  It is impossible&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to determine the location of the engine house of the American Marble Cutting Company, which constitutes the basis for determining the boundaries of the Town of Elizabeth, and it is therefore impossible to prepare an accurate or valid voters' list.  The act of 1964 establishes the same criteria for the boundary of the City of Elizabeth.  The act of 1885 is null, void, and of no legal effect because of laches.  It is unconstitutional and void in that it violates the Constitution, Art. I, Sec. I, Par. II (Code Ann. &sect; 2-102), which provides that &quot;protection to person and property is the paramount duty of government, and shall be impartial and complete,&quot; for the reason that &quot;said act, while granting the town of Elizabeth the power to levy a tax on all property within its boundary, exempts therefrom all land, houses, stock or other property used for agricultural purposes.&quot; Such discrimination violates the quoted provisions of the Constitution of Georgia and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution (which is quoted) because of the discriminatory tax exemption.  The act of 1885 is null and void for the reasons stated, and the act of 1964 is also&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  null and void since &quot;it is merely an attempt to revive that which is dead.&quot; In 1963 certain persons alleging themselves to be residents of the area embraced in the corporate limits of the Town of Elizabeth filed a petition requesting the defendant to call an election under the act of 1885.  The housing Authority of the City of Marietta filed pleadings in Cobb Superior Court asking that the defendant be enjoined from holding this election, and the election under the act of 1885 was enjoined and restrained.  This order being unreversed, it is res judicata as to the validity of the act of 1885.  The act of 1964 is a local act and in conflict with Ga. L. 1963, pp. 251-252, which provides in Section 2: &quot;No local act granting a municipal charter shall be enacted wherein any part of the proposed corporate boundary shall be less than three (3) miles distant from the corporate boundary of any existing municipality.&quot; Code Ann. &sect; 69-1402.  All of the lands embraced in the alleged city limits of the City of Elizabeth are within three miles of the City of Marietta.  The petitioners are residents and taxpayers of the area described in the acts of 1885 and 1964, and they will be subject to all of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the provisions of the act of 1964 and will become residents of the City of Elizabeth unless equity intervenes and enjoins the election provided for in the act of 1964.  The petitioners have no adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayers were for process; for rule nisi requiring the ordinary to show cause why he should not be temporarily and permanently enjoined from conducting the election called for October 6, 1964, and from performing acts as provided by the act of 1964; that the court decree the acts of 1885 and 1964 null, void, and of no effect; and for other relief.  Rule nisi was issued on September 29, 1964, requiring the ordinary to show cause as prayed, and until further order of the court he was enjoined from holding the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John T. Brown and seven other named persons, alleging themselves to be citizens of the area described in the acts of 1885 and 1964, prayed that they be made parties defendant and be allowed to appear, plead, and defend as though they had been named parties defendant.  On October 5, 1964, the petition of Brown and others to be made parties defendant was allowed by the trial judge, and it was ordered that they be allowed to plead and defend in as complete&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  manner as though they had been named parties.  On the same date Brown and others filed their general and special demurrers to the petition, and an answer.  On the same date (October 5, 1964) the Marietta Housing Authority filed a petition praying that it be allowed to intervene as a party plaintiff, and this intervention was allowed.  On the same date (October 5, 1964) the City of Marietta, alleging that the proposed City of Elizabeth is within three miles of the corporate limits of the City of Marietta, moved that it be made a party plaintiff.  This motion was allowed.  On October 5, 1964, the judge of the superior court modified his restraining order of September 29, 1964, by providing that the ordinary &quot;may hold the election&quot; pertaining to ratification of the charter of the City of Elizabeth on October 6, and that the ordinary be enjoined only from certifying the results of the election.  On October 24, 1964, the petition of Mrs. J. C. Patterson, Sr., to intervene as a party plaintiff was allowed.  On November 5, 1964, the judge overruled the demurrers of the defendants John T. Brown and others, and the exception is to this judgment.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 15, 1964, in the City Court of Springfield the State filed an accusation charging plaintiff herein with the criminal offense of &quot;Fishing on Sunday.&quot; This accusation was founded on Ga. L. 1961, p. 157, as amended by Ga. L. 1962, p. 2344.  The 1961 Act amended Code &sect; 26-6908, which prohibited all fishing on the Sabbath, to permit fishing on the Sabbath to all except commercial fishermen, and by Section 1 A excluded from the operation of the law all counties having a population of not less than 6,515 and not more than 6,650, according to the United States census of 1960 or any future such census.  This exclusion applied only to the County of Clinch.  The 1962 Act struck Section 1 A of the 1961 Act and enacted a new Section 1 A providing for the additional exclusion from operation of the law of all counties having a population of not less than 10,140 and not more than 10,150, which affected only Effingham County, and all counties of not less than 500 and not more than 2,000, which affected only Echols County.  Thus, the new Section 1 A merely had the effect of excluding not only Clinch&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  County, but also Effingham and Echols Counties from the operation of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff filed his motion to quash the accusation on the ground that the law on which it was founded is unconstitutional in that it violates the provision of Art. I, Sec. IV, Par. I of the Constitution of the State of Georgia (Code &sect; 2-401) in that it attempts to enact special legislation in the nature of a local Act while there is a general State law covering the subject matter of said Act.  Plaintiff subsequently amended his motion to quash to allege that the Act is unconstitutional in that it violates the provisions of Art. I, Sec. I, Par. II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia (Code &sect; 2-102) in that it denies to defendant the equal protection of the laws.  Plaintiff, however, states in his brief that &quot;the attack as to unconstitutionality of the Acts only goes to that portion of the Acts as attempts to exclude the three counties from the operation of a general State statute.&quot; The motion to quash, as amended, was overruled, and the exception is to that judgment.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with the criminal offense of fishing on Sunday, a violation of 1961 Ga. Laws 157. The act amended O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-6908, which prohibited fishing on Sunday, to permit fishing on Sunday to all except commercial fishermen. The act excluded from its operation counties with a narrow population range. Only one county fit the description. The act was amended to exclude two more counties based on population. Defendant filed a motion to quash the accusation. The motion, as amended, was overruled. Reversing, the court found that the statute under which defendant was charged was unconstitutional because it attempted an arbitrary classification, which was discriminatory and repugnant to the Constitution of the State of Georgia. The act was special legislation, based on unreasonable classifications, because it attempted to classify one county at a time by population brackets so narrow that they could apply to just the one county. The act was also violative of Ga. Const. art.

The compensation carrier shared no part of the expense of procuring the settlement. Based on that, the claimant challenged the constitutionality of Ga.

The court affirmed the judgment and held that the statute did not violate either federal or state constitutional rights because the claimant, by invoking a judgment in his favor for benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Act, waived any privileges he may have had to deny the constitutionality of the act under which the benefits were payable.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that state action was involved and that her conduct was protected by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The court affirmed the conviction and held that there was no prohibition against private discrimination; the Fourteenth Amendment reached only state action. There was no state action that denied equal protection in the mere enforcement of trespass laws in relation to private business establishments from which the management, of its own free will, had chosen to exclude persons of the Negro race. A person's right to freedom of expression did not carry with it a right to force a private property owner to furnish his property as a platform to criticize the property owner's use of that property. A private restaurant differed from that of a public innkeeper, and laws applicable to the latter did not apply to the former. Because the trespass was committed in the presence of the police officer, no warrant was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoners alleged that they were requested to leave the premises due to the proprietor's policy of segregation, the attempt by State and local authorities to maintain such policy, the discriminatory enforcement of &sect; 26-3005, and the State's invoking of such statute to effect such discrimination. The court held that the contentions had been decided adversely to the prisoners in prior decisions of the court. The statute's absence of adequate warning that because one was African-American he was brought within its provisions was immaterial because the statute was directed to all persons. The statute recited standards of conduct to guide the owner and the persons on the property as being the owner's request that a person leave and such person's duty to do so. The claim that the statute was applied so as to abridge the prisoners' rights to make and enforce contracts for services and accommodations on the same basis as white citizens, in derogation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1981, was not sustained by the evidence. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 could not be given retroactive application to violations of O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-3005 (1960) that occurred prior to enactment of such Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equitable petition.  Bibb Superior Court.  Before Judge Long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The will of A. O. Bacon (which was probated in solemn form) in Item Nine gave in trust described property, to be known as &quot;Baconsfield,&quot; to named trustees for the benefit of his wife and two named daughters for their joint use, benefit, and enjoyment during the term of their natural lives.  It was provided that upon the death of the last survivor, the property, including all remainders and reversions, &quot;shall thereupon vest in and belong to the Mayor and Council of the City of Macon, and to their successors forever, in trust for the sole, perpetual and unending, use, benefit and enjoyment of the white women, white girls, white boys and white children of the City of Macon to be by them forever used and enjoyed as a park and pleasure ground, subject to the restrictions, government, management, rules and control&quot; of a board of managers consisting of seven persons, not less than four to be white women and all seven to be white persons.  In order to provide for the maintenance of the park, income from described real property and bonds was to be expended by the board of managers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  E. Newton and others, as members of the Board of Managers of Baconsfield, brought an equitable petition against the City of Macon (in its capacity as trustee under Item Nine of the will of A. O. Bacon), and Guyton G. Abney and others, as successor trustees under the will holding assets for the benefit of certain residuary beneficiaries.  It was alleged: The city as trustee holds the legal title to a tract of land in Macon, Bibb County, known as Baconsfield, under Item Nine of the will of A. O. Bacon.  As directed in the will, the board through the years has confined the exclusive use of Baconsfield to those persons designated in the will.  The city is now failing and refusing to enforce the provisions of the will with respect to the exclusive use of Baconsfield.  Such conduct on the part of the city constitutes such a violation of trust as to require its removal as trustee.  It was prayed that: the city be removed as a trustee under the will; the court enter a decree appointing one of more freeholders, residents of the city, to serve as trustee or trustees under the will; legal title to Baconsfield and any other assets held by the city as trustee be decreed to be in the trustee or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trustees so appointed for the uses originally declared by the testator; and for further relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City of Macon filed its answer asserting that it can not legally enforce racial segregation of the property known as Baconsfield, and therefore it is unable to comply with the specific intention of the testator with regard to maintaining the property for the exclusive use, benefit, and enjoyment of the white women, white girls, white boys, and white children of the city.  The city prayed that the court construe the will and enter a decree setting forth the duties and obligations of the city in the premises.  The other defendants admitted the allegations of the petition and prayed that the city be removed as a trustee.  The petitioners thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reverend E. S. Evans and others, alleging themselves to be Negro residents of the City of Macon, on behalf of themselves and other Negroes similarly situated, filed an intervention in the cause and asserted: The restriction and limitation reserving the use and enjoyment of Baconsfield Park to &quot;white women, white girls, white boys and white children of the City of Macon,&quot; is violative of the public policy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the United States of America and violative of the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia.  The court as an agency of the State of Georgia can not, consistently with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and the equivalent provision of the Constitution of the State of Georgia, enter an order appointing private citizens as trustees for the manifest purpose of operating, managing, and regulating public property (which passed to the City of Macon under a charitable trust created by will) in a racially discriminatory manner.  Although the charitable devise at the time of its creation was capable of being executed in the exact manner provided by the will, by operation of law it is no longer capable of further execution in the exact manner provided for by the testator.  The court should effectuate the general charitable purpose of the testator to establish and endow a public park by refusing to appoint private persons as trustees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By amendment to the petition it was alleged: By the will of A. O. Bacon a trust was established for his heirs.  The trust has been executed as to four of his seven heirs now living, A. O. B. Sparks, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Willis B. Sparks, Jr., Virginia Lamar Sparks, and M. Garten Sparks.  The interests of three remaining heirs, Louise Curry Williams, Shirley Curry Cheatham, and Manley Lamar Curry, are still held under an executed trust by four trustees holding under the authority of the will, these trustees being Guyton Abney, J. D. Crump, T. I. Denmark, and Dr. W. G. Lee.  These seven persons have an interest in the litigation since, if the trust purpose expressed in the will with respect to the designation of persons who may use Baconsfield should fail, the property comprising Baconsfield, together with the property providing the upkeep of Baconsfield, will revert to the estate of A. O. Bacon and be distributed to these heirs.  The amendment prayed that the Sparks heirs be allowed to intervene and that the trustees be allowed to assert the interests of the other heirs.  It was also prayed that the Negro intervenors and other members of the Negro race resident in Macon be permanently enjoined from entering and using the facilities of Baconsfield.  The Sparks heirs and the trustees of the other heirs of A. O. Bacon filed an intervention praying that the relief sought by the original petitioners be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  granted, but that if such relief not be granted, the property revert to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City of Macon filed an amendment to its answer, alleging that pursuant to resolution adopted by the Mayor and Council of the city at its regular meeting on February 4, 1964, the city has resigned as trustee under the will of A. O. Bacon.  It prayed that the resolution be accepted by the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Negro intervenors filed an amendment to their intervention in which they asserted: The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the court from enjoining Negroes from the use of the park, and from accepting the resignation of the City of Macon as trustee and appointing new trustees for the purpose of enjoining (enforcing?) the racially discriminatory provision in the will of A. O. Bacon.  Code &sect; 69-504 prescribes racial discrimination and is therefore violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Since the racially discriminatory provision in the will was dictated by that unconstitutional statute, enforcement of the racially discriminatory provision is constitutionally prohibited.  Code &sect; 108-202, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  properly construed, requires that the racially discriminatory provision in the will be declared null and void.  The intervenors prayed that the court withhold approval of the attempted resignation of the city as trustee under the will, direct the city to continue to administer the park on a racially nondiscriminatory basis, and deny the injunction sought by the petitioners to exclude Negroes from the use of the park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 10, 1964, the judge of the superior court entered an order and decree in the case which adjudged as follows: (1) The intervenors named are proper parties in the case and are proper representatives of the class which their intervention states that they represent, the Negro citizens of Bibb County and the City of Macon.  (2) The defendants, Guyton G. Abney, J. D. Crump, T. I. Denmark, and Dr. W. G. Lee, as successor trustees under the will of A. O. Bacon, and intervenors A. O. B. Sparks, Willis B. Sparks, Jr., Virginia Lamar Sparks and M. Garten Sparks are also proper parties.  (3) The City of Macon having submitted its resignation as the trustee of the property known as Baconsfield, the resignation is accepted by the court.  (4) Hugh M. Comer, Lawton Miller, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B. L. Register are appointed as trustees to serve in lieu of the City of Macon.  (5) The court retains jurisdiction for the purpose of appointing other trustees that may be necessary in the future.  (6) It is unnecessary to pass upon the secondary contention of the intervenors Guyton G. Abney and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reverend E. S. Evans and others in their writ of error to this court assign error on this order of the trial judge.  Their contentions will appear from the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The testator's will gave in trust property to the city for use as a park for white citizens, and it would be managed by a designated board. The board members brought an equitable petition against the city and other trustees. The city asserted that it could not legally enforce racial segregation of the property, and therefore it was unable to comply with the specific intention of the testator. The board members thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment. The reverend and Negro citizens of the city filed an intervention. The superior court entered an order and decree, which accepted the city's resignation as trustee, and appointed new trustees. The intervenors appealed. The court affirmed because the testator had the absolute right to give property to a limited class. Also, the cy pres rule was not invoked by the primary parties and thus unavailable, but even if the intervenors had raised the issue, the facts before the trial court were insufficient to invoke a ruling that the charitable bequest was incapable of execution in the exact manner provided by the testator.</SPAN></P>

The voter wanted the Act of 1960, 1960 Ga. Laws 2147 declared unconstitutional and the committee enjoined from certifying a candidate as the party's nominee for a district commissioner office.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The candidate that the voter voted for received the majority of votes in the district to which he was trying to be elected. However, the candidate that the committee nominated received the majority of votes in the county at large. The voter alleged that the Act of 1960 was unconstitutional because it allowed a candidate who received the majority of votes in the county at large to receive the nomination and not the candidate that received the majority of votes in the district to which he was going to represent. The court held that because it appeared from the petition that no election was held except under the Act of 1960 and that the candidate being nominated and not the one the voter voted for received the majority vote in that election, no duty rested upon the committee to certify the candidate the voter voted for as the successful candidate in that election. The court held that the candidate who was being nominated who had received the majority of the votes and who was the successful candidate in the only election held was not named a party to the case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner alleged that 1956 Ga. Laws 100 (the Act) was unconstitutional. The title clearly indicated that the Act authorized county school boards to condemn private property for public school purposes, and a &quot;public educational program&quot; was a public school purpose and sufficiently embraced by the title of the Act. Therefore, the Act did not contain matter not contemplated by the title. Therefore, the Act was not open to the objection of plurality of subject matter within the meaning of Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; VII, para. VIII. The landowner also alleged that the junior college was not a public educational program authorized by law so that condemnation therefore was unauthorized. A junior college that was established, constructed, equipped, maintained, operated, and administered by a county board of education as a &quot;community educational institution&quot; was clearly a public educational program. It was also clearly authorized by law. Therefore, the DeKalb County Board of Education was authorized under the Act to condemn the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lessee was a foreign corporation and it had ceased doing business in Georgia. It contended that jurisdiction over it would violate due process and equal protection because at the time of service of process it was not a resident of Georgia, was not doing business in the state and had no office, agent or statutory agent in the state. It also charged that &sect; 22-1211 violated due process and equal protection. The trial court overruled the plea to the jurisdiction and the motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court affirmed. The appellate court's previous holding that jurisdiction was proper was the law of the case. The lessee did not challenge the validity of &sect; 22-1211 before the first appeal in its motion to abate the action and vacate the entry of service. After the appellate court ruled that the motion was not valid, the lessee could not challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 22-1211. The lessee should have asserted the question of the constitutionality of the statute at the outset in its motion to abate the action and traverse the return of service, before the appellate court had ruled against it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal from defendant's conviction for bribery based upon his act of bribing a public official, the court found that his conviction could not stand because the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional.

The court found that while the title of the act prohibited the offering or accepting of anything of value to influence members of the executive branch of government, the legislative branch of government, or the judicial branch of government, the actual section under which defendant was convicted included not only &quot;members&quot; of the three branches, but also any officers or employees or persons acting for or on behalf of the state or agency thereof. Therefore, the statute contained matter different from that expressed in the title of the act, and violated Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; VII, para. VIII ( Ga.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a habeas corpus case in which it is alleged that the prisoner is an indigent and illiterate Negro who was not properly represented by counsel at any stage of the case, was not advised of his constitutional rights in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions in that he was not indicted by a grand jury or tried by a petit jury legally composed, that he at no time waived or authorized the waiver of any of his constitutional rights to be tried by a fair and impartial jury, and the verdict and sentence to die by electrocution are in violation of the 14th Amendment and the State Constitution in that it constitutes cruel and inhuman treatment because of the severity of the sentence disproportionate to the offense charged in that life was neither taken nor endangered.  By amendment the statute (Code Ann. &sect; 26-1302; Ga. L. 1960, p. 266) under which he was sentenced to death is likewise attacked as being unconstitutional in violation of the &quot;cruel and unusual punishments&quot; clauses of the State Constitution and the 6th, 8th and 14th Amendments of the Constitution of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  United States in that the statute fails to set out any standards by which the jury can be guided in its determination of the sentence to be imposed, alleging that (a) the State of Georgia has executed for rape 58 Negro persons and only 3 White persons since 1930; (b) execution for rape violates evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, which are more or less accepted universally; and (c) in the instant case the imposition of the death penalty is erratic and arbitrary, he being the only known person sentenced to death for rape in this county since 1913, only two other persons having been sentenced to death, both for murder, which sentences were later commuted to life imprisonment.  He further alleges that the admission of a confession signed by him violated his right of due process under the 14th Amendment since it was obtained by threats and force at a time when he was unrepresented by counsel, he being illiterate, and after he had been beaten and threatened with death if he denied committing the crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence was introduced at the hearing in regard to (1) the selection of the names of jurors from the tax digests of Charlton County; (2) the illiteracy, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ignorance and indigency of the prisoner; (3) exhibits and documents with reference to capital crimes and punishment which were not allowed in evidence; and (4) testimony and documents submitted to prove the lack of counsel at various stages of the case, including the holding of the first and second committal hearings, the last time the prisoner saw his appointed counsel, the failure by counsel to file a motion for new trial, and the reasons why defense counsel failed to raise certain questions in defense during the trial and prior to trial, and particularly as to whether or not the prisoner had been beaten in a doctor's office, including a review of questions asked of the doctor which included the doctor's testimony in regard to the victim as to bruises on her chest, around her breasts, shoulders, neck and eyes, and the transcript of the committal hearing as to his testimony with reference to his examination of the victim within two hours after the alleged rape showing her hysteria and extreme nervous shock in which she stated she had been raped, the condition in which he found her private parts showing that her hymen had been stretched to allow entrance to the vagina, blood stains&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  present around the entire area, with tears in the mucuous membranes, and that she had been menstruating and was still menstruating, and the condition of her clothing and body with mud on her legs and thighs.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the prisoner's constitutional rights were violated by the State's failure to provide counsel for the prisoner's appeal of his sentence. Subsequent to his trial, the prisoner was incarcerated, was without counsel and was ignorant of his right to appeal. The appeal of the death sentence was a critical stage of the proceedings in the prisoner's conviction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trespass; constitutional questions.  Savannah City Court.  Before Judge Oliver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 5, 1963, at the August term of the City Court of Savannah there came on for trial the cases of the State of Georgia against James Durham and James Alexander (hereinafter referred to as the Durham case), against William German and Albert Mack (hereinafter referred to as the German case), and against Wallace Lloyd, Billy Simmons, Johnny Hyman, Willie Pickett, Walter Roland Abney, Shirley Miller, Gloria Bartow, William T. Sams and John R. Smith (hereinafter referred to as the Lloyd case), the same being on accusation wherein the defendants were charged with violation of the Act 1960 (Ga. L. 1960, p. 142; embodied in Code Ann. &sect; 26-3005) which reads: &quot;It shall be unlawful for any person, who is on the premises of another, to refuse and fail to leave said premises when requested to do so by the owner or any person in charge of said premises or the agent or employee of such owner or such person in charge.  Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished as for a misdemeanor.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Unless otherwise indicated the following recitation is applicable to each of the three cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before arraignment and before pleading to the accusation the defendants filed a general demurrer to the accusation on the following grounds: that the Act of 1960 is unconstitutional on its face because it is so vague, indefinite and uncertain in that it fails to require that the person making the demand to leave the premises present documents or other evidence of possessory right sufficient to apprise defendant of the validity of the demand to leave so as to violate his rights to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and it is unconstitutionally applied to the defendant in that it makes it a crime to be on property open to the public after being asked to leave, because of race or color, in violation of defendant's rights under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The demurrer was overruled by the trial judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants then filed their plea in abatement reading: that the Act of 1960 is unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied to the defendant's conduct which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  consisted solely of peacefully protesting against racial segregation in the City of Savannah; that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to the defendant's conduct in that it violates rights of free speech and assembly secured by the First Amendment and the due process clauses of the Georgia and United States Constitutions; that the statute as applied violates the defendant's rights under the equal protection and due process clauses of the United States Constitution in that it is used for the purpose and effect of thwarting the activities of the defendants, who are Negroes, against racial segregation; that the statute and accusation under it are so vague, indefinite and uncertain as not to fairly apprise the defendants of the acts they are charged with committing, thus denying them an opportunity to effectively prepare a defense, in violation of rights secured by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Ruling thereon was reserved until the introduction of evidence was complete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the trial of the case, the judge of the court presided without the intervention of a jury as trier of the law and facts of the case.  Evidence was then&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  introduced by the State, at the close of which the trial judge overruled the defendants' plea in abatement.  Counsel for the defendants then filed a motion to acquit which was likewise overruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence adduced was in substance as follows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Durham case (#22398) witnesses for the State testified that the defendants were sitting down in the vestibule and leaning back against the doors, which blocked ingress and egress to Morrison's Cafeteria; that the defendants were on Morrison's property; that the defendants were requested to leave by the assistant manager of the cafeteria, refused, and the police were summoned; that, subsequently, they were again asked to leave in the presence of the police and by the police and upon their continued refusal to comply were arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants testified they were arrested for taking part in a demonstration at Anton's (another restaurant) not at Morrison's.  They stated they were arrested by a Negro policeman.  The Negro policeman they identified testified he did not make any arrests at Anton's at that time.  In rebuttal, a police lieutenant positively identified the two defendants as the ones blocking the door at Morrison's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the German case (#22399) witnesses for the State testified that the defendants were in an alcove or foyer, &quot;just outside the door,&quot; on Morrison's property and were either sitting or lying and blocking the doorway; that the defendants refused to leave despite repeated requests that they do so and were finally arrested.  The manager of Morrison's and a police officer both testified that some lay down and some stood up but they blocked the door preventing customers from entering or leaving Morrison's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant German in an unsworn statement denied that the defendants were on Morrison's property or blocked anyone from going into or leaving the cafeteria.  He stated they were standing outside the cafeteria and were informed that it was closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Lloyd case witnesses for the State testified that after closing hours the defendants entered Morrison's in a group of about 25 and sat at tables, on the floor and in the lobby; that they refused to leave after being requested to do so and finally were arrested.  The assistant manager of Morrison's testified the defendants came when the cafeteria was not serving after lunch; that there were signs in plain view indicating the cafeteria&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was closed; that the entrance door was locked but the defendants entered through the exit door; that a few customers were still eating, who had been served prior to closing time.  He further testified: &quot;Morrison's is cafeteria style, you have to go down a line and pick out your food and then waiters carry your tray to the table, the defendants did not get in that line.&quot; When asked whether he would have asked a white person acting similarly to leave, the witness stated: &quot;Well, this was after serving hours and under the circumstances I would have probably asked them to leave.&quot; Police officers testified that the serving line was closed and the defendants did not attempt to enter such serving line as is customary in a cafeteria but merely said &quot;they wanted to be served&quot; while sitting at the tables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants introduced no evidence but stood mute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In none of the cases was there any evidence that the defendants requested of the management or employees of Morrison's that they be served, nor was there any showing made that the defendants proclaimed the purpose of their acts or otherwise espoused their cause while sitting, lying or standing on the premises of the cafeteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the evidence and after argument of counsel the trial judge entered a judgment finding each of the defendants guilty and sentencing them to &quot;$ 100 or 2 months, 4 months on Public Works probated.&quot; Albert Mack received a sentence of &quot;$ 200 or 4 months, 6 months on Public Works probated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants each filed a motion for new trial on the usual general grounds and the following special grounds: because the verdict results in denying to the defendant the equal protection of the laws secured by the United States Constitution; because the verdict and judgment enforced against the defendant was the result of the unconstitutional application of the statute in such manner as to deny this defendant the equal protection and due process of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth and First Amendments to the United States Constitution.  The trial judge overruled the motions for new trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cases having been consolidated, the defendants filed a single bill of exceptions and assigned as error the overruling of the demurrers, the plea in abatement, the motion to acquit and the motion for new trial, and the refusal to admit certain evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case is here for review.  </SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendants argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied to defendants' conduct, which consisted solely of peacefully protesting against the custom of the restaurant of serving only white people and thereby discriminating against members of the Negro race. The court affirmed the convictions and ruled that the restaurant proprietor had a legal right to choose his patrons and no law, state or federal, denied him, the owner of a privately owned establishment operated on private property, from confining the services of the restaurant to members of a particular class or race. The court further ruled that the state's evidence showed that defendants did not assemble peacefully, but intruded upon the property of another, wilfully interfered with the business of the owner, and that this conduct amounted to violence and was the wilful, unlawful invasion of the rights of another.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with acting indecently during a church service. The trial court denied several of defendant's motions, and he was ultimately convicted of interfering with a religious worship in violation of &sect; 26-6901. On appeal, the court affirmed holding that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to recuse the trial judge because the statutory bias required under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 24-102 was not established. The court further held that defendant's general demurrer to the indictment was properly overruled because Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-6901 sufficiently apprised defendant of what conduct it prohibited, so it was not unconstitutionally vague. The court also held that the trial court had sufficiently charged the jury on the offense and had properly allowed plaintiff to cross-examine defendant regarding collateral matters. Finally, the court held that the evidence supported the guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The fiscal officers of Fulton County refused to pay the sheriff of that county the increased amount of salary due him under 1963 Ga. Laws 2944 for the period from January 1 to the approval date of the act. He brought mandamus to compel such payment by them. The commissioners demurred to his petition on the ground that the act, insofar as it had retroactive effect, offended O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-302, Ga. Const. of 1945 art. I, &sect; 3, para. 2, which provided that no retroactive law shall be passed. Their demurrer also attacked the validity of the Act insofar as it provided compensation or salary for the sheriffs affected prior to the date of its approval on other enumerated constitutional grounds. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and noted that where a part of an act is valid and a part unconstitutional, the valid part will be upheld when it is reasonably certain that to do so will correspond with the main purpose which the legislature sought to accomplish by its enactment, if, after the objectionable part is stricken, enough remains to accomplish that purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed from an order of the Glynn Superior Court (Georgia), which sustained plaintiff's oral motions to dismiss the pleas to the jurisdiction and the cross bills seeking to enjoin the proceedings. Defendants contended that the trial court lacked jurisdiction under Georgia Const. art. VI, &sect; XIV, para. IV (1945) ( Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-4904) and Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 3-204, and that another trial court was the most convenient forum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff filed a tort action against defendants. One defendant, a corporation, was considered a resident of the same counties as the two other defendants, as well as of a third county. Defendants objected to the court's jurisdiction and filed cross bills seeking to enjoin the action on the ground of forum non conveniens. The trial court dismissed the pleas to the jurisdiction and the cross bills. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that jurisdiction was proper under Georgia Const. art. VI, &sect; 14, para. 4 (1945) ( Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-4904) and Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 3-204, which provided that suits against joint tortfeasors who resided in different counties could be tried in any county in which a defendant resided. The court explained that even though the corporate defendant resided in the counties where the other defendants resided, it also resided in a county where the other defendants did not reside, and therefore resided in a &quot;different&quot; county within the meaning of the laws. The court also held that the trial court did not have the power to enjoin another proceeding where jurisdiction was proper under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equitable petition.  Jenkins Superior Court.  Before Judge Usher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wade Burke filed his equitable petition in the Jenkins Superior Court against Modern Homes Construction Company, in which he sought to enjoin the sale of certain described property that was being advertised for sale under the powers contained in a certain deed to secure debt held by the defendant.  The plaintiff sought a temporary injunction and a permanent injunction against the sale, punitive damages and attorney's fees and prayed that the described deed to secure debt be canceled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant corporation not having an agent, office or place of doing business in Jenkins County, service was perfected upon the defendant at its office and place of business in Valdosta, Lowndes County, Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition alleged in substance that the plaintiff owned a described lot in Millen, Jenkins County, Georgia, in fee simple; that the defendant corporation induced him to enter into an agreement by the terms of which the defendant constructed a dwelling house on the lot for him in consideration of his executing to it a note for $ 4,244.40, the purchase price of the house, payable in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  installments of $ 58.95 per month, and a deed to secure the loan; that a part of the agreement between the parties was that the defendant would obtain at the plaintiff's expense what is known as credit life insurance upon the plaintiff's life conditioned that in the event of his death or total and permanent disability the insurance company would pay &quot;all amounts due on the loan&quot;; that the agent represented both the insurance company and the defendant corporation, a fact of which the plaintiff was not aware; that in connection with the application for the insurance policy the plaintiff informed the agent that he could not read or write and did not know his own age, but that according to reports he was &quot;somewhere around the age of 54 or 55,&quot; whereupon the agent proposed, and he agreed, to &quot;put his age down at 55&quot;; that the agent promised to send the policy to him but never complied with the promise; that the American Casualty Insurance Company issued the policy, but he did not know and the agent did not advise him of two clauses contained in the policy -- one limiting the age of the insured to 55 years and the other providing the insurance would only remain in force until the insured&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  attained the age of 60 years, so that in the event the insured was over 55 years old when the policy was written, or after he reached the age of 60 years he would not be within its coverage; that after the policy was issued the plaintiff became totally and permanently disabled; that the American Casualty Insurance Company on numerous occasions made payments to the Modern Homes Construction Company on the loan secured by the deed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was further alleged that: &quot;on an unknown date the defendant and plaintiff were informed by American Casualty Insurance Company that they would not pay any further installments due on said note and demanded a refund of all moneys paid under the policy because the plaintiff was alleged to be born in 1900.  The truth of this is unknown to plaintiff.  The defendant corporation has committed a fraud upon your petitioner, by misleading the plaintiff as to coverage under the insurance policy and failing to advise the plaintiff the exact terms of said contract of the insurance, when in the facts [sic] said information was within the knowledge of said company, that the plaintiff did not know his correct age, and acting upon said advise [sic] erroneously given, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  recklessly given, and in complete disregard of the contractual rights of the party, induced your plaintiff into executing a deed to secure debt over said property which was free and unencumbered at said time.  That said act was done with intent to defraud and did defraud your petitioner due to the fact that they well knew that it was a possibility that he might be over fifty five years of age and said acts constitute fraud and did defraud your petitioner out of the fee simple title to property which he owned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant corporation did not file an answer, but filed a motion to dismiss and strike the plaintiff's petition and thereafter filed an amendment to the motion to dismiss and strike.  The court thereafter overruled the defendant's motion to dismiss, as amended, on each and every ground thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The questions of law raised by the motion to dismiss as amended involve the jurisdiction of the Jenkins Superior Court to entertain a suit in equity against a nonresident defendant, having no agent in that county upon whom suit could be served, and against whom cancellation of the deed, permanent injunction, damages and attorney's fees were sought.  It is contended that the petition&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  showed on its face that the Superior Court of Lowndes County had jurisdiction of this cause of action and the same could not be brought in Jenkins County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff contends that Ga. L. 1962, p. 659 (Code Ann. &sect; 3-202), which reads: &quot;All petitions for equitable relief shall be filed in the county of the residence of one of the defendants against whom substantial relief is prayed, except in cases of injunctions to stay pending proceedings, when the petition may be filed in the county where the proceedings shall be pending, provided no relief is prayed as to matters not included in such litigation.  For the purposes of this section, foreclosures and sales under power shall be considered pending litigation&quot; authorized the bringing of this suit in Jenkins County despite the fact that the defendant corporation had no office, agent or place of doing business in Jenkins County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant contends that the petition for affirmative equitable relief, including damages, cancellation of a deed and attorney's fees, took the case out of the narrow class of cases authorized by Code Ann. &sect; 3-202, supra, and that the last sentence of the section is unconstitutional as being in conflict&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with Art. VI, Sec. XIV, Par. III of the Constitution of Georgia providing: &quot;Equity cases shall be tried in the county where a defendant resides against whom substantial relief is prayed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the overruling of the motion to dismiss as amended, the defendant excepts and brings its writ of error to this court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant in error construction corporation brought a writ of error from the Jenkins Superior Court (Georgia), after excepting to the overruling of the corporation's motion to dismiss as amended. The equitable petition was brought by plaintiff in error lot owner seeking to enjoin the sale of his dwelling house property that was being advertised for sale under the powers contained in a deed to secure debt held by the corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court was to decide whether the Act of 1962 (Act), Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 3-202 (amended 1962) was in conflict with Ga. Const., art. VI, &sect; XIV, para. III, codified by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-4903, which read that equity cases should have been tried in the county where a defendant resided. Under former Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 3-202, the exercise of a power of sale contained in a security deed was not litigation within former &sect; 3-202. The Act re-enacted former &sect; 3-202 verbatim but added a final sentence stating that for the purposes of &sect; 3-202, foreclosures and sales under power should have been considered pending litigation. The lot owner correctly contended that the portion of the Act providing that &quot;sales under power&quot; constituted litigation was unconstitutional. The provision was a mere attempt by the legislature to construe &sect; 3-202 contrary to prior court holdings. Thus, the separation of powers doctrine set out in the state constitution and in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-123 was violated. The superior court's judgment was reversed and the corporation's motion to dismiss was granted. The superior court could not have entertained a suit in equity against the nonresident corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the superior court, which overruled the corporation's motion to dismiss as amended. The motion was granted from the lot owner's equitable petition brought to enjoin the sale of his property under a security deed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant mother was awarded custody of the parties' minor child in the divorce decree.

The mother filed a motion to strike and purge, attacking the constitutionality of the Act of 1962, 1962 Ga. Laws 713-715. The Superior Court of Fulton County (Georgia) overruled the motion to strike.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act conferred upon minor children who reached the age of 14 years the right to select the parent with whom such child desired to reside, provided the trial court in the exercise of its discretion found such parent a fit and proper person to have custody of the child. The mother contended that the Act was unconstitutional. She also contended that the fact that the child had reached his 14th birthday and had expressed a desire to live with his father could not alter the final order of the trial court fixing custody. The court upheld the trial court's judgment. The court held that the welfare of the child was the paramount issue for consideration by the trial court in all contests between parents over custody. Under the Act, no parental right of custody by judgment or decree could defeat the right of a child reaching 14 years of age to select the parent with whom such child desired to live.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case is one brought by the Solicitor General of the Macon Judicial Circuit to validate certain revenue bonds issued by the Middle Georgia Coliseum Authority (created by Ga. L. 1963, p. 2250 et seq.) and to adjudicate the validity and binding effect of a lease contract entered into by and between the authority and the City of Macon.  The payment of the principal and interest on the bonds was and is to be secured by the rental revenue to the authority arising by virtue of the lease contract with the city.  An answer was filed by the city and the authority, and thereafter a citizen and taxpayer filed an intervention, which was thereafter amended, alleging the Act creating the authority and the bonds issued in conformity therewith and the lease are unconstitutional, null and void for the numerous and varied reasons set forth, i. e., in substance, (1) Section 10 of the law, supra, impairs the obligations of contracts (Code &sect; 1-134 and Code Ann. &sect; 2-302); creates a general obligation debt of the city without it being assented to by the majority of the qualified voters (Code Ann. &sect; 2-6001); is special&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  legislation attempting to do by indirection that which it can not do directly, that is, make the revenue bonds issued by the authority a pecuniary liability of the city (Code Ann. &sect; 2-401); (2) the law is in conflict with the charter of the City of Macon by attempting to usurp the power of the municipal authorities to appropriate revenue and discretion to levy taxes as provided by said charter (Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2-1908, 2-1915); (3) the bonds are to be sold with the lease agreement as security, providing the full faith and credit of the city acting as a general obligation of the taxpayers without the vote of the majority (Code Ann. &sect; 2-6001); and (4) the bonds are unconstitutional on their face since they violate the law (Code Ann. &sect; 87-807 and Code Ann. &sect; 2-6001) in that they empower court action for the compelling of the power of taxation by the city.  The lease contract is further alleged to be violative of the general law in that it requires the enforcement of nonpayment by the right of taxation in violation of Code &sect; 87-807, supra, and made not only for the benefit of the lessor but for the holder of the authority's bonds, having all the rights of the lessors in violation of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  statute under attack.  It also alleges that the facilities proposed are inadequate and it is not feasible to validate the bonds due to the economic position of the city and the proposed reliance upon the County Commissioner of Bibb County to take over certain governmental obligations of the city.  The intervenor prayed that the Act and the lease agreement be declared unconstitutional, and the validation of the bonds be denied.  General and special demurrers were filed to the intervention, and a motion was made to dismiss it.  However, a judgment was granted, in effect, denying the prayers of the intervention and overruling the objections therein, by declaring the authority was legally created and authorized to issue the bonds, to pledge all the revenues from the lease contract to the payment of the principal and interest on the bonds, and to charge and collect rent from the lease of its public coliseum and related facilities, the bonds not to be payable from or a charge upon any funds or property other than the revenue pledged to the payment thereof; the city had full legal authority to enter into the lease contract with the authority, and the terms thereof are valid, legal and binding, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the rental revenue to the authority is adjudged to be security for the payment of the principal and interest on the bonds, and the city authorized to covenant therein that it would make available and use for payment any and all money received or entitled to be received by virtue of its power of taxation and within any millage limitation, and the allotment payment of same would constitute a first charge on all the tax revenues of the City of Macon within any millage limitation thereof; the said bonds are not a debt of the city or of the State of Georgia; all other general obligations of the city, being payable from the taxes levied on all the taxable property within the city without limitation as to rate or amount shall in nowise be affected by said lease and no part of said lease contract shall in anywise impair the obligation of any lawfully existing contract of the city; and the said bonds being issued pursuant to the Constitution and laws of the State are therefore confirmed and validated.  The exception is to this judgment.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case involves the anti-trespass law (Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal as at trial, defendant charged that the accusation was based on &sect; 26-2005, which was unconstitutional on its face because it was vague, indefinite, and uncertain in failing to require the person making the demand to leave the premises to present documents or other evidence of possessory right sufficient to apprise defendant of the validity of the demand and because it was unconstitutional as applied to defendant in basing the crime on the race or color of the person being asked to leave, contrary to the due process and equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. In affirming the trespass conviction of defendant, the court ruled that the constitutionality of &sect; 26-2005 was manifested in its provision of authority to every owner, manager, or his agents, to request anyone, whomsoever, to leave his private property and the due process protection was limited to the point where it invaded another's life, liberty, or property interest. Further, the failure of defendant's counsel to submit an approved records brief, as required, served to allow affirmance. Declining to guess what the true evidence was, the court also refused to sanction the failure to conform to the rules.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, the relatives alleged that the automatic appointment of the guardian as administratrix violated the guaranty of due process under Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. III and the prohibition against amendment or repeal by mere reference to title or section in Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; VII, para. XVI. The superior court later granted summary judgment for the guardian and declared the caveat to be valid. The relatives appealed. The court affirmed, holding that Ga. L. 1958, p. 377 did not violate the constitutional guaranty of due process. The court explained that the guardian had all of the duties and liabilities of any administrator and that the relatives had the same protection against improper administration. The court also concluded that the relative's contention that Ga. L. 1958, p. 377 violated the constitutional prohibition against amendment or repeal by mere reference to title or section was also without merit.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the court ruled that it was error for the trial judge to sustain the highway department's demurrer and motion to strike the railroad's answer and objections.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was convicted of committing two counts of sodomy and was sentenced. The lower court denied his writ of mandamus to compel the parole board to consider his application for parole. The court reversed that decision because it found that the inmate was eligible to be considered for parole and the sentence imposed for the second count was void because the facts alleged did not constitute the crime of sodomy. The court found that sodomy as defined by Ga. Code &sect; 26-5901 must be committed by man with woman in the same unnatural manner as it is by man with man, that is, by use of the male sexual organ either per anum or per os and that the second count of the inmate's conviction was therefore improper. The court found no merit in the argument that the inmate did not pursue the proper remedy because habeas corpus was not available since the inmate was a state prisoner under a valid conviction for the first count. The court found mandamus was the only remedy available by which the inmate could collaterally attack the void judgment of conviction under count two and compel the parole board to consider the application for parole.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant sought to rezone certain property from residential use to apartment-office use. The property adjoined the landowners' property. The landowners opposed the rezoning and argued that the issuance of a permit to construct an office building would depreciate the value of their property. The court held that the trial court had properly sustained the demurrers and dismissed the landowners' petition for failure to set forth a cause of action. The landowners' contention, that the applicant had no standing to seek rezoning because it did not own the property at the time it filed the rezoning application, was without merit. 1952 Ga. Laws 2689, &sect; 9 did not restrict the initiation of zoning changes to owners of property but allowed for such initiation by interested parties. Further, the court held that &sect; 9 was constitutional and did not deny due process because it provided for judicial review of rezoning decisions. The fact that the county expressed favoritism toward the rezoning prior to its decision did not deny the landowners a fair and impartial hearing. Finally, the county had the power to grant the rezoning under 1952 Ga. Laws 2689, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

Laws 261-263, O.C.G.A. ch. 26-25 created and defined the offense of robbery by use of an offensive weapon.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted that O.C.G.A. ch. 26-25 contravened Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; 7, para. 8 because it fixed the punishment although the caption only stated that the offense was defined. Defendant contended that the provision was unconstitutional because it contained more than one subject matter by creating a new grade of robbery. The Georgia Constitution prohibited laws that referred to more than one subject matter or contained matter different from what was expressed in the caption. The court held that the fixing of a punishment for robbery by the use of an offensive weapon was germane to the definition of the offense, the law was not unconstitutional because of the failure to refer to the punishment in the caption, and the only matter dealt with was the crime of robbery. The indictment plainly charged robbery by the use of an offensive weapon. The evidence sufficiently showed that the pistol used by defendant was an offensive weapon likely to produce death when used in its usual manner, as charged in the indictment. Defendant's requested instruction regarding robbery by intimidation was properly denied because the issue was not presented and would have confused the jury.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 14, 1959, the State Highway Department filed a proceeding to condemn described lands under the provisions of the Act of the General Assembly of 1957 (Ga. L. 1957, pp. 387-397; Code Ann. Ch. 36-6A).  A special master, as provided by that Act, was appointed by the judge of the superior court.  After a hearing, the special master, on February 23, 1960, awarded to Mrs. W. J. Stewart, as life tenant, and the First National Bank of Atlanta, as executor and trustee of W. J. Stewart (hereinafter referred to as the condemnee), the sum of $ 48,625.  On February 27, 1960, the judge entered a decree condemning the property in fee simple upon payment of the award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 4, 1960, the State Highway Department filed its appeal to a jury in the superior court.  On October 9, 1962, the jury returned a verdict for the condemnee in the sum of $ 31,934.  On October 11, 1962, the judge entered a judgment reciting that condemnee had received an overpayment of $ 16,691.  It was decreed that the condemnor have judgment for this amount, together&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with interest at 7% per annum from April 27, 1960, in the sum of $ 2,953.35.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 15, 1962, the condemnee filed a motion to strike the item of interest in the sum of $ 2,953.35, and on the same date the judgment was amended striking the item of interest.  On October 22, 1962, the condemnor filed a motion to vacate and set aside the order of October 15, 1962, amending the judgment of October 11, 1962, which included interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this motion the court entered a rule nisi requiring the condemnee to show cause why the motion should not be granted.  To this motion the condemnee filed a response wherein it was alleged in part: &quot;. . . interest in said judgment is illegal . . . there being no express contract on the part of condemnee to pay interest on any amount, nor is there any basis for holding there is any implied contract . . . to do so.&quot; A requirement for &quot;the condemnee, to pay interest on any said amount paid into court under the proceedings under eminent domain, brought by the State of Georgia,&quot; and &quot;to accept an involuntary loan forcibly, would be violating the Constitution of the State of Georgia Art. I, Sec. I, Par. II, Code Section 2-102, which provides that: 'protection&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to person and property is the paramount duty of the Government and shall be impartial and complete.'&quot; To &quot;charge interest on the amount which condemnor was required to pay into court to take possession of the private property of condemnee under the statute, would be forcing the condemnee to accept a loan from the State of Georgia involuntarily and be charged with interest, thereby depriving the condemnee of equal protection under the aforesaid section of the law . . . and condemnor is undertaking to make a contract by charging interest on an unliquidated demand, when the primary and only purpose of the taking or condemning said land is for the purpose of establishing the value of the property, to be paid to condemnee, and until the same is established by law there could be no interest charged. . . .  The Act of 1957, pp. 387-396 . . . which provides 'If the verdict of the jury be less than the award of the special master, the owner shall be bound to refund any excess paid to or received by him and a judgment for such excess shall be rendered against him, plus lawful interest thereon from the date of such payment,' is unconstitutional as herein set out and alleged and void for the reasons&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  herein set forth . . . requiring your petitioner to involuntarily borrow money and accept a loan from the Government and then being charged with interest against its wishes or consent . . . would violate the due process clause of Georgia . . . Art. I, Sec. I, Par. III, Code Sec. 2-103, 'That no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property, except by due process of law,' . . . and it would require the condemnee, movant herein, to pay interest on money which is involuntarily forced on it, . . .  The law only allows interest because of a contract, express or implied, for its payment, or as damages for the detention of money, or for breach of some contract, or the violation of some duty . . . interest at 7% per annum in the amount of $ 2,953.35 is wholly illegal . . . and would deprive this movant . . . of due process of law . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 4, 1963, the judge passed an order reciting that the judgment of October 11, 1962, had been amended on October 15, 1962.  It was ordered, &quot;after the consideration of all pleadings and all issues raised therein,&quot; that the judgment of October 15, 1962, be vacated and the judgment of October 11, 1962, be reinstated, &quot;except the interest as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  specified in said judgment of October 11, 1962, as $ 2,953.35 shall be $ 2,865.75.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The proceeding by the condemnor was to condemn lands under the Act of the General Assembly of 1957, 1957 Ga. Laws 387-397; O.C.G.A. ch. 36-6A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a condemnation action, a special master made an award to the condemnee, which was entered by the trial court. On appeal, the jury returned a verdict for the condemnee in a lesser amount. The condemnee disputed the interest awarded, and the trial court struck the interest and later vacated that order and reinstated a lesser amount of interest. On appeal, the court found that under the general law of Georgia the claim of the condemnor for refund was unliquidated until fixed by the jury. To hold that the condemnee was subject to the payment of interest prior to the verdict of the jury would deny the condemnee equal protection of the law and due process of law. Under the general law of Georgia, the condemnee was denied equal protection and due process in that none of the several procedures for the condemnation of property authorized interest on refunds due the condemnee prior to the time the amount of such refund was fixed by the verdict of the jury. The provision of O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-615a for interest from the date of payment on the excess paid to or received by the condemnee, where the award of the jury was less than the award of the special master, was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five named persons in their official capacities as members of the DeKalb County Board of Education and five other named persons in their official capacities as members of the City of Decatur Board of Education brought their petition against named persons in their official capacities as members of the Georgia State Board of Education and against Claude Purcell in his official capacity as Georgia State Superintendent of Schools, praying for mandamus absolute against the defendants requiring them pursuant to the Minimum Foundation Program of Education Act, Ga. L. 1949, pp. 1406-22 (Code Ann. Ch. 32-6), &quot;to calculate the local financial abilities of petitioners and to allot to them their lawful portions of the Minimum Foundation Program of Education funds determined according to the provisions of said act without giving effect to the last quoted sentence of Section 13 (c) of said act reading as follows: 'In determining the local financial ability of the Counties of Fulton and DeKalb the economic index for the two counties shall be combined so long as the boundaries of the independent school system of Atlanta falls in both Fulton&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and DeKalb Counties,'&quot; the same being unconstitutional, null and void for stated reasons alleged in the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayers were amended to ask that the last sentence of Section 13 (c) &quot;be declared null, void, and of no effect and unconstitutional as contravening and violating&quot; certain provisions of the Constitution of Georgia, to wit: Art. I, Sec. IV, Par. I (Code Ann. &sect; 2-401) (uniformity clause); Art. I, Sec. I, Par. II (Code Ann. &sect; 2-102) (protection to person and property should be impartial and complete); Art. III, Sec. VII, Par. XV (Code Ann. &sect; 2-1915) (special law for which notice must be given.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the petition as amended the defendants filed general demurrers on numerous grounds, all of which were overruled.  The case was submitted to the trial judge upon the pleadings, the defendants stipulating that demand had been made by plaintiffs upon defendants that the last sentence of Section 13 (c) of the act (Ga. L. 1949, pp. 1406, 1415; Code Ann. &sect; 32-615 (c)) be ignored in determining the amount due them under the act, that the same calculations used as to the other counties and school systems in the State be used as to them, and that they be allotted their lawful portion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Minimum Foundation Program of Education funds determined according to the act without giving effect to the last sentence of Section 13 (c) of said act.  Defendants admitted that funds disbursed to the DeKalb and Decatur Boards of Education for the 1961-62 school year, and those to be disbursed for the 1962-63 school year, were and would be calculated according to the provisions of Section 13 (c) and that plaintiffs received less than they would have received had the calculations used as to the other 157 counties been used as to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge thereafter entered judgment declaring the last sentence of Section 13 (c) of the act unconstitutional and granting mandamus absolute as prayed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 32-615 (1949) of the Act provided that the calculation of the county's financial ability occurred in combination with an adjoining county because an independent school system fell within both. That calculation caused a substantial shortfall in funding to the county. The court affirmed the unconstitutionality of &sect; 32-615, and the mandamus that ordered additional funding. Initially, the court rejected standing challenges to the plaintiffs' action because their being subordinate units of government was not relevant to standing, only that they were hurt by &sect; 32-615. In affirming that &sect; 32-615 was not constitutional, the court found that its joining the two counties solely on the basis of a school system being in both was arbitrary and lacked a legal basis for that classification. Further, such classification violated the uniformity clause, Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; IV (1945) because the legislative intent of the Act pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 32-601 (1949) established that it was general in nature as to all counties.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herman Parker and four other named persons, as citizens and taxpayers, made application to file an information in the nature of quo warranto to inquire into the right of W. B. Davis and five other named persons to hold office as Jury Commissioners in Long County.  The Judge of the Superior Court of Long County, the Honorable Henry H. Durrence, entered an order certifying his disqualification and referring the cause to the Honorable Walton Usher, Judge of the Superior Courts of the Ogeechee Circuit.  Judge Usher granted the application, and ordered that the respondents be served and that they show cause at a stated time why the prayers of the relators should not be granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The information of the relators asserted that the respondents had been appointed as Jury Commissioners of Long County under authority of an act of the General Assembly approved January 29, 1962 (Ga. L. 1962, pp. 6-8).  It was alleged that the act was &quot;in the nature of local or special legislation,&quot; and that it was unconstitutional and void for stated reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A copy of the order of the judge of the superior court removing the former&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jury commissioners and appointing the respondents as jury commissioners was attached to the petition as an exhibit.  In this order the judge first stated that he was naming the respondents as jury commissioners in compliance with the 1962 act (Ga. L. 1962, pp. 6-8).  Thereafter, in the same order, the former commissioners were removed and the respondents named as successor commissioners under the provisions of the general law.  It was recited that the last revision of the jury list in Long County had caused much criticism, it being contended that the revision was incomplete and biased, and that many qualified persons were left off of the list; and that it was of vital importance that the jury list be revised.  It was then ordered that the terms of the Jury Commissioners of Long County be terminated and their offices declared vacant, and that the respondents be designated, appointed, and commissioned as Jury Commissioners for Long County to succeed those whose terms of office had been terminated.</SPAN></P>

The court found O.C.G.A. &sect; 59-101 allowed judges wide discretion to remove jury commissioners. Because the judge who appointed the commissioners and dismissed the former commissioners was authorized under &sect; 59-101 to remove jury commissioners and appoint another board, the citizens' action was without merit and was properly dismissed on general demurrer. The provision of the act complained of could not be challenged since the more general statutory provision allowed the action complained of and entitled the jury commissioners to hold their posts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dixie Fireworks Company, Inc., brought an action for injunction and declaratory judgment against McArthur, Sheriff, and others.  The petition attacks the validity of an act approved February 6, 1962, to become effective on July 20, 1962 (Ga. L. 1962, pp. 11-14), restricting the manufacture, sale, and use of fireworks.  The plaintiff alleged that: On July 20, 1962, it loaded a motor vehicle with ten cases of fireworks for the purpose of transporting them to Hamer, South Carolina, pursuant to an order.  While the fireworks were in transit on U. S. Highway No. 76 in Whitfield County, the motor vehicle was stopped by the sheriff and the fireworks seized as contraband.  On the same date the sheriff entered the premises of the plaintiff and seized twenty cases of fireworks which are the property of the plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff prayed for process; that the court declare the rights of the parties; that the 1962 act (Ga. L. 1962, pp. 11-14) be declared unconstitutional and void; and that the defendants be restrained and enjoined from doing any act or thing relative to the enforcement of the act.  The trial judge sustained&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a general demurrer to the petition, and the exception is to this judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By brief filed in this court the plaintiff makes four contentions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) The trial judge erred in sustaining the general demurrer and in failing to declare the rights of the plaintiff and the defendants, it being contended that the petition shows that an actual and justiciable controversy existed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) The Fireworks Act of 1962 (Ga. L. 1962, pp. 11-14) is unconstitutional in that it violates the Commerce Clause of the Constitution of the United States and undertakes to legislate in a field which has been pre-empted by the Acts of Congress, as set out in the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) The acts of the defendant, Sheriff McArthur, constitute an unreasonable, arbitrary, and extravagant interference with the plaintiff's property rights in violation of the due process clause of the State and Federal Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) The Fireworks Act of 1962 (Ga. L. 1962, pp. 11-14) is unconstitutional and violative of the due process clause of the State and Federal Constitutions, since the State constitutional and statutory provisions which created the office of each member of the General Assembly who voted for the act are themselves unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants contended that plaintiffs were not entitled to join the insurer as a defendant to their claims and that the Georgia Motor Carriers Act of 1931, 1931 Ga.

The court determined that contrary to defendants' claim that they were involved in interstate commerce, rather than intrastate commerce, the provisions of &sect;&sect; 7 and 30 of the Georgia Motor Carriers Act of 1931, 1931 Ga. Laws 199 et seq., applied to the motor line even though it was only operating as a carrier in interstate commerce. The court held that there was a rational basis to require &sect;&sect; 7 and 30 to be applied to the motor lines and the application of the provisions did not violate Ga. Cons. art. I, &sect; I, paras. II and III (O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 2-102 and 2-103) or U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court also held that &sect;&sect; 7 and 30 of the Georgia Motor Carriers Act of 1931, 1931 Ga.

</DIV>

The driver's petition attacked, as unconstitutional, several portions of the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act of 1951, O.C.G.A. ch. 92A-6. The court found that the driver's petition did not allege that he had appealed the Director's decision to superior court, as provided in &sect; 5 of the Act. Since the driver had an adequate remedy of appeal, he had not exhausted his statutory remedies, and the court would not entertain his suit in equity for injunctive relief. The court also stated that it would not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute where a determination of the statute's constitutionality was not essential to the disposition of a case. The court found no error the in the trial court's in sustaining of the Director's general demurrer and dismissal of the driver's petition.</SPAN></P>

Laws 67, &sect;&sect; 2 and 3, which amended 1952 Ga. Laws 238 to provide a pension to widows or widowers of superior court clerks who died prior to the enactment of the amendment, violated the constitutional restriction against enactment of retroactive laws and laws impairing the obligations of contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Superior Court Clerk's Retirement Fund Act of 1952, 1952 Ga. Laws 238, did not provide for a pension payable to the widow or widower of a deceased clerk. The Act was amended by 1962 Ga. Laws 67, &sect;&sect; 2, 3 to add a new &sect; 9A, which provided for pensions to widows or widowers of superior court clerks who died before or after the amendment, and to modify &sect; 10, pertaining to the withdrawal of funds. The court said that Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; III, para. II, codified as O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-302, prohibited the passage of a retroactive law or a law impairing the obligation of contracts. A statute was retroactive which created a new obligation on transactions or considerations already past. A constitutional act of the legislature was equivalent to a contract which, when performed, was an executed contract, and whatever rights were thereby created could not be impaired by a subsequent legislature. The court held the trial court did not err in ruling the amendments unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An action for declaratory judgment was instituted in Whitfield Superior Court by the ordinary of the county against the commissioner of roads and revenues and members of the advisory board to the commissioner, and was brought to this court by writ of error, the bill of exceptions assigning error on the judgment of the trial court sustaining the defendants' general demurrers.  The case arose as the result of an act of the General Assembly enacted into law in the year 1960 (Ga. L. 1960, pp. 2007, 2017).  The act contained a provision which read:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Commencing with the term of office which begins on January 1, 1961, the Sheriff of Whitfield County, the Clerk of Superior Court of Whitfield County, the Ordinary of Whitfield County, the Tax Collector of Whitfield County, and the Tax Receiver of Whitfield County, shall be paid monthly salaries by Whitfield County, and said salaries shall be said Officers' sole compensation for performing the duties of their respective offices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It further provided that the annual budget of operating expenses for each of the offices would be passed upon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the commissioner of roads and revenues and the advisory board of the county under a mode of procedure therein prescribed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition, however, alleged that for several reasons the act of 1960 was unconstitutional and based the plaintiff's whole case for declaratory judgment, to adjudicate the plaintiff's rights concerning the issues in controversy, upon the contention that the act was unconstitutional and hence void.  In the plaintiff's supplemental brief filed in this court he emphasizes this position: &quot;plaintiff is asking that the act be declared unconstitutional so that he will then have the right to: (1) Employ two full-time clerks to perform the typing and other clerical duties in his office so as to free himself for the performance of his administrative and judicial duties, and (2) The fees and compensations due him at the present and which will be due him in the future . . .  Plaintiff had not asked for any inconsistent remedy but has simply asked that the court declare the act unconstitutional so that he might have all of the relief as prayed for in the petition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record of the case discloses that there was no prayer for service on the Attorney General of the State; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the Attorney General was not served with a copy of the proceedings and made no appearance in the case.  In argument before this court, counsel for the plaintiff candidly admitted that, through inadvertence, service upon the Attorney General as required by the declaratory judgments law of force in this State had been omitted.  </SPAN></P>

On appeal of the trial court's order sustaining defendants' general demurrers, the court affirmed and ruled that the trial court had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case. The court determined that service on the attorney general in compliance with &sect; 11-1106 in a case in which the constitutionality of a state statute was attacked was mandatory and jurisdictional and that without such service the trial court could not render a declaratory decree conclusive of the questions presented.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the act did not violate Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a criminal case involving a joint indictment against the accused that they did unlawfully sell and offer to sell and did possess for the purpose of selling at a certain newsstand certain indecent, obscene and immoral pictorial magazines, pamphlets and booklets, tending to debauch the morals, the accused having knowledge of the nature of the contents of said publications; the indictment thereafter setting forth descriptions of said pictures and subject matter contained in the booklets.  The indictment is alleged to be an offense of &quot;violating Sec. 26-6301, Supp. Code of Ga.&quot; Before pleading to the merits of the indictment, the defendants presented their demurrers and plea in abatement.  After a hearing thereon the court overruled the same, and the exception is to this judgment, the pleadings having raised certain constitutional attacks upon the statute and the indictment.  In particular, one of the constitutional attacks is that the statute upon which the indictment is based is discriminatory in that it violates Art. I, Sec. I, Par. II of the Constitution of Georgia (Code&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ann. &sect; 2-102; Const. of 1945) providing that &quot;Protection to person and property is a paramount duty of government and shall be impartial and complete.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed a decision of the Fulton Superior Court (Geiger), which overruled their demurrers and pleas of abatement to an indictment charging them with the sale of obscene literature. Defendants raised certain constitutional attacks upon the statute and the indictment, including that the statute upon which the indictment was based was discriminatory in that it violated Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal of the trial court's order overruling defendants' demurrers to the indictment, the court reversed, concluding that the indisputable purpose of the law prohibiting the sale of obscene literature was to prevent injury to the public which would result from the making, importation, possessing, advertising, selling, or giving away any of the obscene materials covered by the law. The court held that no rational distinction could be found between the evils which the law sought to prevent that would flow from the handling in the manners forbidden of the obscene materials by those to whom the law was applicable and the new media, whom the law exempted from its operation. Therefore, the court found that no justification or reason existed for the classification, which it considered the rankest sort of discrimination, and the exemption rendered the law offensive to Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. II. For that reason the act was unconstitutional and void, and the trial court erred in overruling the demurrer containing that ground of attack and in refusing to dismiss the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The insured, a resident of Turner County, filed his petition seeking to recover damages for the alleged breach of an automobile collision insurance contract against the insurer, a Florida corporation with an agent and office in Albany, Dougherty County, in the Superior Court of Turner County, alleging that the insurer was a resident of Turner County within the meaning of Ga. L. 1960, p. 500 (Code &sect; 56-1201(4)).  The insurer filed its plea to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court of Turner County on the ground that the act of the General Assembly in question was violative of the Georgia Constitution in several particulars which are hereinafter set out.  To the overruling of its plea to the jurisdiction the defendant has excepted and has assigned the same as error.  After the overruling of defendant's plea, the case proceeded to verdict and judgment for plaintiff.  Defendant moved for a new trial on the general and several special grounds.  To the denial of its amended motion for a new trial defendant has excepted and has assigned the same as error. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All the aforesaid exceptions are presented in the present writ of error.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In plaintiff insured's petition seeking to recover damages for the alleged breach of an automobile collision insurance contract, defendant insurer challenged the decision of the Turner Superior Court (Georgia), which denied the insurer's plea to the jurisdiction, which alleged that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 56-1201(4) was violative of the Georgia Constitution, and denied the insurer's amended motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court conditionally affirmed, and held that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 56-1201(4) was not unconstitutional as violative of Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; XIV, para. VI ( Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-4906) because that constitutional provision contained no restriction as to where a defendant had to reside. The act, which permitted an action to be maintained against an insurer in the county of the residence of the holder of the policy, or in the county where the property was located, did not deny due process of law.  Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 56-1201(4)) did not violate the equal protection provisions of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. II ( Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-102) by excepting from its operation insurance companies bound and obligated as surety upon the bond of law enforcement officers. Letters written to the insured's attorney by the insurer's agents were not inadmissible as representing settlement negotiations. The jury was properly charged as to the measure of damages. The insurer's refusal to pay, in the belief that it had completely performed its legal obligation by repairing the automobile, was not an unfounded denial of liability such as to authorize a charge relative to bad faith under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 56-1206.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment in favor of the insured was affirmed on condition that the insured write off the amounts awarded as damages and attorney's fees for bad faith within 10 days after receipt by the trial court of the remittitur from the court; otherwise reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee entered into an agreement with the employer and the insurer under O.C.G.A. &sect; 114-705 for compensation for an injury that arose out of and in the course of his employment. The agreement also provided that the payments would continue until terminated under Georgia workmen's compensation law. After the Georgia State Board of Workmen's Compensation approved the agreement, it possessed all of the force of an award of compensation. The employee then filed an application alleging that the insurer and the employer ceased payments under the agreement. The employer and the insurer argued that O.C.G.A. &sect; 114-711 did not give them a right to object to the award if the employee's status changed. On review, the court found that the statute was an elective statute and that the employer and the insurer voluntarily submitted to the terms of &sect; 114-711 when they entered into the agreement. The court noted that the answer by the employer and the insurer did not present a constitutional question. However, the court concluded that the employer and the insurer were concerned about the constitutionality of &sect; 114-711, and that question had to be addressed by the Georgia Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>

The petition was sufficient because it alleged that the levy was excessive. Moreover, the owner sufficiently alleged that the fieri facias was levied against property that was valued no lower than $ 25,000, that it was capable of being divided, and that a vacant parcel of the property could have been sold to bring the amount of the fieri facias The owner was not required to allege the illegality of the tax itself in order to obtain an injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State, as obligee of a surety bond, brought suit against the principal and his surety. The court certified two questions. First, did the ruling of the court that the State had no status or right to challenge the constitutionality of an act of the general assembly, particularly Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 56-1201, raise a question of which only the supreme court had jurisdiction to determine? Second, if the first question was answered in the negative, did the State have the right to attack the constitutionality of the act when the rights of the State could have been affected by the act? The court answered the first question in the negative and the second question in the affirmative. Because the trial court denied a motion for a new trial that challenged the constitutionality of the legislation, the court had jurisdiction to pass on the constitutionality of the act. Because the State was a party litigant, rather than a party sovereign, it was affected by &sect; 56-1201, which purported to fix the venue of the action to enforce the surety bond. Therefore, the State had standing to challenge the validity of the statute and was not estopped and relegated to seeking repeal of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refusal of interlocutory injunction.  Fulton Superior Court.  Before Judge Alverson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exception in the present case is to an order of the Superior Court of Fulton County denying an interlocutory injunction sought by the Southern Railway Company against the Georgia Public Service Commission, to restrain the commission from enforcing an order entered on December 11, 1961, as amended on January 31, 1962, granted on the application of Solvay Process Division, Allied Chemical Corporation against Southern Railway Company and Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company, with reference to the railroad services and rates charged at Solvay's plant at Brunswick, Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proceedings before the commission, including the pleadings, evidence, findings of fact, and order of the commission, are incorporated in the bill of exceptions.  In its complaint to the commission against the Southern Railway Company and Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company, Solvay asserted that: It is located on the Turtle River spur track of the Southern Railway System, which spur track likewise serves Brunswick Pulp &amp; Paper Company and Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation.  Olin Mathieson&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chemical Corporation is a competitor of Solvay for the sale of chemical products to Hercules Powder Company, at Brunswick.  Effective June 2, 1958, Southern and A. C. L. canceled a joint operating agreement which had existed since 1902, and entered into a new agreement.  Under the new agreement A. C. L. is permitted to serve all shippers on Southern's Turtle River spur track with the single exception of Solvay.  Olin Mathieson is listed as being served by both A. C. L. and Southern, and Solvay is listed as being served only by Southern.  Prior to the termination of the 1902 agreement, the complainant had been accorded dual services by both railways.  By the discontinuance of the services previously afforded from Solvay's plant to the Hercules Powder Company, located on the tracks of A. C. L., it is charged an interterminal switch rate of $ 26.38, rather than the intraterminal rate of $ 19.18, which formerly applied.  During 1959, 217 cars were switched between the plants, and this movement cost the complainant $ 1,562 more than it would have under the former services.  Due to the denial of the former switching arrangement, the complainant is now compelled to pay a reciprocal switching&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  charge of $ 6.85 per car when its products are shipped beyond Brunswick.  These actions by the respondent carriers were effectuated arbitrarily and without notice to the Public Service Commission.  The complainant seeks restoration of the services in existence at the time it located its plant on the Turtle River spur track of the Southern Railway in 1955, which services, complainant contends, were &quot;assured&quot; by both railroads, and it relied upon these assurances at the time it purchased the site and constructed the plant where it is now operating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. C. L. filed an answer with the commission in which the material allegations of Solvay's petition were admitted, but it contended that the 1902 operating agreement was canceled by Southern over its protest, that after cancellation Southern refused A. C. L. the use of its track, and that A. C. L. stands ready to resume the former service under the 1902 agreement.  At the hearing before the commission, A. C. L. contended that it was not responsible for the change in operations, and was ready to resume former services when authorized by Southern to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its answer Southern denied that its agent made the &quot;representations&quot; as to service&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as alleged by Solvay.  It admitted that A. C. L. had access to the plants of the Brunswick Pulp &amp; Paper Company and Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation, and asserted that access to these plants by A. C. L. was limited to line haul traffic.  It admitted that the former intraterminal switch from complainant's plant was superseded by an interterminal switch.  It contended that it was under no obligation to notify the commission of the change, and denied that it had violated any provision of the statute law or any rule of the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hearing oral testimony and the introduction of documentary evidence, the commission made a finding of fact and entered a judgment which provided in part: &quot;Ordered: That the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company and Southern Railway Company be, and they are hereby, required to remove the unjust discrimination here found to exist against Solvay Process Division, Allied Chemical Corporation, either by broadening, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">so far as intrastate commerce is concerned</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the provisions of the herein discussed 1958 joint operating agreement to permit the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad to serve Solvay Process Division, Allied Chemical Corporation, to the same extent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it is permitted to serve Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">or by making such tariff adjustments on intrastate traffic as will give Solvay Process Division, Allied Chemical Corporation, the same freedom of choice of routes and services available to Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation at the same rates and charges available to that company</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot; (Italics ours.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After its motion for reconsideration filed with the commission was denied, Southern filed its petition seeking to enjoin the enforcement of the commission's order, and alleged: The commission's findings and order were not supported by the evidence, but were contrary to the evidence.  The commission erred in classifying Solvay as a &quot;captive&quot; industry, hence its order is invalid and should be enjoined.  The commission's order, if enforced, would constitute a burden on interstate commerce.  The commission's order, if enforced, would impair the obligations of a contract in contravention of Art. I, Sec. X, Par.

The order of the commission was based on the erroneous conclusion that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the cancellation of the 1902 operating agreement and the execution of the 1958 agreement constituted an unjust discrimination against Solvay.  The order of the commission deprives the petitioner of its right to exercise cancellation of the 1902 agreement, and is an action by the State impairing the obligations of a contract, which is forbidden by Art. I, Sec. X, Par. I of the Constitution of the United States (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Code</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &sect; 1-134).  For the commission to require the petitioner to permit A. C.

The commission is without legal authority to compel one railroad to permit another to use its tracks.  The order of the commission violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Code</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &sect; 1-815) and Art. I, Sec. I, Par.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant railroad challenged an order of the Superior Court of Fulton County (Georgia), which denied an interlocutory injunction sought by the railroad against appellee Georgia Public Service Commission to restrain the Commission from enforcing an order granted on the application of a company against the railroad with reference to the railroad services and rates charged at the company's plant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company alleged that due to the denial of a former switching arrangement, it was compelled to pay a reciprocal switching charge. The company alleged that the railroad's actions were arbitrary and effected without notice to the Commission. The company sought restoration of the prior services. The Commission ordered the removal of the unjust discrimination. The railroad sought to enjoin the enforcement of the Commission's order. The trial court denied the railroad relief; the court affirmed that judgment. The evidence, while not without conflict, was ample to support the finding by the Commission that discrimination by the railroad against the company existed. By neither the pleadings nor the evidence was it clearly shown that the Commission's order was unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. The statutes creating the Commission were not in violation of either federal or state constitutional provisions, as an unlawful interference with the liberty of contract, or a taking of property without due process of law. The railroad was without authority to suspend the voluntary service provided under the prior contract, until after notice and a hearing by the Commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The production company argued that the city charter and ordinance provisions which required inspection of protected as well as unprotected pictures, and also required a city permit before any picture was exhibited in the theatre violated the Ga.

The court reversed the finding in favor of the city, agreed with the production company, and held that the city ordinance violated the Ga. Const. under &sect; 2-115. The court found that speech or press that was not an abuse of liberty under the Ga. Const. was protected by &sect; 2-115. The court noted that no interference no matter for how short a time and how small the degree was tolerated under &sect; 2-115. The court further held that the words of the Ga. Const. in &sect; 2-115, providing that no law was permissible &quot;to curtail or restrain&quot; a freedom, were irreconcilable with any law including a city ordinance that curtailed and restrained. However, the court held that the ordinance and charter forbidding the showing of any picture without approval by the censor did not offend the U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An indictment charged defendants with the crime of burning an automobile to defraud an insurer. Defendants asserted that the indictment failed to charge them with the commission of a crime because the language of the Act was insufficient under Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; VII, par.

Defendants also argued that the indictment failed to allege who was the owner of the automobile, failed to allege the insurance policy number, failed to allege that the automobile was insured at the time it was destroyed by a fire, and failed to assert that a loss was suffered by the insurer. On appeal, the court overruled defendants' demurrer that the indictment failed to charge them with a violation of a crime because the language of the Act met the constitutional requirement that the general object of the law, arson, be indicated by the title or caption of an act and a synopsis of the law was not required to be in the title. Likewise, the offense charged against defendants was in the language of the statute and the Act provided notice of the legislature's intention to enact other sections relating to the crime of arson not referred to in the title of the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The village claimed that 1952 Ga. Laws 2618, which purported to annex the territory to the city was unconstitutional. The city claimed that the village's charter was invalid, arguing that certain requirements were not met and the statutes under which the village was incorporated were unconstitutional. A judgment was rendered that the territory belonged to the village and the city excepted. In affirming, the court ruled that collateral attacks on the village's charter, granted in 1924, could not be considered at that late date and the city lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the incorporation statutes. The 1952 annexation statute violated the one subject-matter and title provisions of Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; 7, para. 8 (1945), because it purported amend the city's charter by annexing to it territory that was actually within the corporate limits of the village, even though the village was not expressly mentioned. Finally, the village's suit was not barred by laches or O.C.G.A. &sect; 3-512 (1953), which pertained to involuntary dismissal of actions for want of prosecution after five years. Such a dismissal was not res judicata so as to preclude refiling of the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged and convicted of unlawful assembly. Defendants alleged that O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-5301 was unconstitutional per se and as applied. On review, the court found that the demurrer did not properly attack those defects that appeared on the face of the accusation. The court noted that a demurrer, which sought to add facts, must fail as a speaking demurrer. In addition, the court held that defendants were only charged with disturbing the public peace; therefore, the alleged vagueness of committing an unlawful act did not have to be considered. The court also determined that defendants failed to state what specific part, paragraph, or section was unconstitutional. The court reasoned that when a constitutional question as to a statute was raised, the provision of the constitution alleged to have been violated had to be clearly specified. The court concluded that the language in &sect; 26-5301 was pronounced in terms so lucid and unambiguous that a person of common intelligence could discern its meaning and apprehend with what violation he was charged.</SPAN></P>

Laws 163, as amended. Excepting to the ruling, defendant invoked the court's jurisdiction because some of her demurrers challenged the constitutionality of the obscenity statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for possessing indecent and obscene photographs. On appeal, the court noted its duty to inquire into its jurisdiction on its own motion. Defendant's first constitutional challenge to the statute was that its exemption of certain broadcast media, theaters, and newspapers violated a provision of the Georgia Constitution requiring general laws to apply uniformly and equally to all citizens. This attack did not clearly designate the constitutional provision claimed to be violated as the cited constitutional section did not exist. Defendant also claimed that the statute violated freedom of the press as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. This attack failed to show how the obscenity statute violated the cited constitutional provision. The same demurrer also asserted that the statute was class legislation because some were exempt. Again, the demurrant failed to designate the constitutional provision allegedly violated. She also challenged the entire statute in four particulars, but did not mention how it violated any constitutional provision. The other grounds of demurrer involved no constitutional issue or any other issue over which the court had jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile court remanded the mother's children to the custodians after findings of neglect and unfitness. The mother sought a writ of habeas corpus to regain custody; the trial court denied the application. On appeal, the court held that relief was properly denied. While the mother argued that she was not advised that her parental rights were severed at one of the hearings, the court found that she not only attended such hearing and made no effort to appeal but that she also had actual knowledge of the juvenile court's custody of the children for over two years and attended various hearings. The court held that based on the record, there was no due process or equal protection violation in the proceedings. Further, the mother's blanket constitutional attack on the Georgia Juvenile Court Act of 1951 (Act), as amended, as violative of the state constitution's uniformity clause, was without merit; because some portions of the Act were clearly constitutional, such fact alone defeated an attack on the entire Act. Also, &sect; 27 the Act, 1951 Ga. Laws 306, 307, was not unconstitutional in denying the mother a jury trial because she had no such right in a juvenile court proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted judgment in favor of the State and the Solicitor-General, and the taxpayers sought review. Pursuant to Ga. Const. art. 7, &sect; 6, the County and the City were authorized to levy taxes, not to exceed one mill on all taxable property, for the purpose of acquiring and creating a fund to encourage the promotion of new local business. Under an amendment to the provision, the Authority was created to be an instrumentality of the State and was authorized to provide issuing for revenue-anticipation certificates and revenue bonds. The court held that the amendment had been properly ratified and further determined that, because the Authority was a purely public charity, it was exempted from taxation under O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-5404. The court held that the bonds were valid. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commissioner issued a fieri facias against the taxpayer for personal property taxes and filed a collection action. The taxpayer filed an affidavit of illegality, arguing that assessment and collection of taxes on specified property violated the Georgia Intangible Act of 1937-38, specifically O.C.G.A. &sect; 92-122, and also violated due process under U.S. Const. amend.

The court found that no attack was made on the constitutionality of any statute; further, the taxpayer did not seek construction of any constitutional provision.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E. J. Jenkins brought a petition for declaratory judgment against James A. Manry and others, as members of the Muscogee County Plumbing and Steam Fitting Board of Examiners, charged with the enforcement and administration of the act of 1937 (Ga. L. 1937, pp. 748-753), as amended (Ga. L. 1939, pp. 355-356; Ga. L. 1952, p. 2383; Ga. L. 1959, pp. 3090-3091).  It was alleged: The plaintiff is the owner of Ace Plumbing Company, a sole proprietorship, located in Columbus, Muscogee County, Georgia, and has been engaged in the business of plumbing contracting and repair from January 1959, through the date of filing the petition.  The business conducted by the plaintiff is a valuable property, and he has invested considerable money on special machinery and equipment for plumbing installation and repair.  The proceeds received from the operation of his business are the only source of income to the plaintiff and his family.  After the 1959 amendment, the provisions of the act apply to all areas within Muscogee County, outside the city limits of Columbus, the effective date of the act in Muscogee County being February&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1, 1960.  The plaintiff furnished the board of examiners evidence of the fact that he had engaged in the vocation of master plumber for the preceding five consecutive years, but the board required him to take an examination which was purportedly designed to test his knowledge and skill as a master plumber.  He failed to pass the examination, which caused the board to refuse to issue him a certificate to engage in the vocation of master plumber.  He has secured an order to install a plumbing fixture in a house at a stated address, which is located in Muscogee County, outside the city limits of Columbus.  He has applied for and received a plumbing permit to install the fixture, as required by the Plumbing Code of Muscogee County of 1946.  He has secured a business license from the Clerk of Muscogee County for the year 1960 to engage in the business of plumbing and heating.  The members of the board have informed him that if, as the owner of Ace Plumbing Company, he installs the fixture in the described house, he will be prosecuted for violating the act of 1937 as amended.  It is the opinion of the plaintiff that the act in its entirety, and enumerated sections thereof, are repugnant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to stated provisions of the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Georgia, for reasons set forth in the petition.  The enforcement of the provisions of the act by the board will cause irreparable injury to him, and his business will be seriously injured unless such enforcement is restrained pending final determination of the issues set forth in the petition.  The declaration of rights and legal relations is essential for the guidance of all parties in the controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayers were for process; rule nisi; for declaratory judgment declaring that the act of 1937 and specified sections of the act as amended are void, unconstitutional, ineffective, and without force of law, and that the plaintiff is not required to comply with the terms and provisions thereof; that the defendants be restrained from exercising any of the powers, rights, or duties respecting the enforcement of the act against the plaintiff pending final determination of the issues; for costs; and for other and further relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general demurrers of the defendants were sustained, and the exception is to this judgment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants contended that the act of 1937, Ga. L. 1937, pp. 748-753, (act) was unconstitutional and sought a declaratory judgment to that effect. Appellees demurred. The court determined that one of the sections alleged to have been unconstitutional provided for impermissible discrimination against individuals who were not connected with a partnership or corporation because the provision created a situation whereby the individual would not be permitted to engage in plumbing or steamfitting without having obtained a certificate as required by the act. However, individuals associated with a partnership or corporation in which one individual had obtained a certificate could engage in such activity even if the individual to whom the certificate was given did not supervise the work. The court found that there was no reasonable basis for the discriminatory conduct because the actions of one class would have the same impact on the public health and safety as the actions of members of the other class. The court found the act unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exception is to the judgment of the Superior Court of Marion County, sustaining the general demurrer to a petition in which the plaintiff sought to enjoin the defendant Highway Department from proceeding with the condemnation of a certain tract of land, and in which he attacked the constitutionality of the condemnation act of 1914 as amended (Code &sect;&sect; 36-1104 -- 36-1116).  The plaintiff maintained that he, as executor of the estate of W. E. Mitchell, should have been served with notice of the condemnation proceeding against land, title to which was in him as executor.  He and the seven other devisees of the land were served with notice in the condemnation proceeding as the &quot;owners&quot; thereof.

On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that a separate equitable action did not lie to enjoin condemnation proceedings under &sect;&sect; 36-1104 et seq., because the condemnee could obtain equitable relief within the condemnation proceedings. The court reasoned that, unlike the former condemnation act, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1106 (1914) allowed persons interested in the property at issue to assert their claims and other matters material to their rights, and Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1113 (1914) allowed interested parties to file appropriate pleadings in condemnation proceedings.

The usual general grounds of a motion for a new trial, found in defendant's bill of exceptions, presented no other question than the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict. Further, defendants' assignment of error that the statute under which they were convicted and under which their sentences were imposed was unconstitutional, as violating their due process and equal protection rights, was not sufficiently specific to raise a constitutional question; moreover, even if the challenge was specific enough, it had no place in a motion for a new trial and, because it was not directly assigned as error in the bill of exceptions, presented no question for review by the court. The court concluded that defendants raised no question as to the constitutionality of a statute or any other issue that conferred jurisdiction on the court.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case is here on grant of certiorari to the Court of Appeals in Milam v. Adams, 101 Ga. App. 880 (115 S. E. 2d 252). The Sheriff of Floyd County, Joe Adams, under an execution against the defendant Milam, levied upon certain real estate as the property of Milam, and sold the property at public sale.  The plaintiff Todd was the purchaser at the sale, and he paid the amount of his bid, $ 2,025, to the sheriff.  The sheriff applied $ 1,210 of the purchase price to the satisfaction of the fi. fa. by paying that amount to the plaintiff in fi. fa., and turned the excess of $ 738.85 over to Milam, the defendant in fi. fa. and the defendant here.  The defendant in fi. fa. in 1942 had conveyed the property sold to one Morgan by deed to secure debt.  Subsequently to the sheriff's sale, this court ruled that the act providing for reversion of title to the grantor in a deed to secure debt after twenty years (Ga. L. 1941, pp. 487, 488, as amended by Ga. L. 1953, Nov.-Dec. Sess., pp. 313-315; Code Ann. &sect; 67-1308) was unconstitutional when applied to deeds to secure debt executed prior to passage of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  act, and affirmed the judgment of the trial court directing the jury to find a verdict in favor of the grantee in the deed to secure debt, to the effect that the deed from the sheriff to Todd was void and of no force and effect.

The purchaser paid the amount of his bid to the sheriff. The sheriff applied the purchase price to the satisfaction of the fi. fa. and turned the excess over to the property owner. Subsequent to the sheriff's sale, the Supreme Court of Georgia ruled that the act providing for reversion of title to the grantor in a deed to secure debt after 20 years, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 67-1308, was unconstitutional when applied to deeds to secure debt executed prior to passage of the act. The deed from the sheriff to the purchaser was therefore void. The purchaser and the sheriff brought an action against the property owner to recover what was paid him. The court reversed and held that the purchaser took with notice that the property owner had no title except by reason of the statute which provided that the title which he had conveyed away under a deed to secure debt would revert to him after 20 years under certain conditions. He necessarily relied upon the statute at his peril, and when the title failed by reason of the unconstitutionality of the statute, the purchaser acquired no title.</SPAN></P>

Constitutional attacks under both the State and Federal Constitutions were made on various sections of the General Tax Ordinance of the city as amended (on March 23, 1960) by the mayor and board of aldermen, which amendment recites that, &quot;pursuant to Georgia laws 1959, page 3251, as amended by act of the General Assembly of Georgia, approved March 17th 1960 and known as House Bill 1007, the General Tax Ordinance for 1960,&quot; adopted October 5, 1959, is amended, etc.  The ordinance as amended levied a tax of $ 50 for the remainder of the year 1960 on the practice of professions licensed by the State.

The act applied to cities with a population of more than 300,000 and allowed the city to exercise its discretion in imposing in an additional tax on all professions licensed and regulated by the State. Upon review, the court found that the Legislature was authorized to make a classification of the cities on the basis of population. It could pass a general law based upon such a classification if the classification had some reasonable relation to the subject matter of the law. The court found that all cities that had the required population under any future census could not come within the terms and provisions of 1959 Ga. Laws 3252. Thus, it was not a general law. The court concluded that the amendment did not add anything of substance to the invalid and unconstitutional act. Further, the State had no reasonable or substantial relation to the classification that granted cities with a population of over 300,00 to require an additional tax for all professions licensed and regulated by the State.</SPAN></P>

The hospital's claim that it was a charitable organization did not make it one. The hospital had no requirement that all those needing medical attention were to receive it or that those who could pay were to be excluded.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant Georgia State Highway Department filed a bill of exceptions to the judgment of the Superior Court of Dougherty County (Georgia), which dissolved the order restraining plaintiff landowners from prosecuting their suits for damages against the county for takings, sustained their constitutional attacks on Ga. Code &sect; 95-1712, and declared that the Department had a duty to defend the suits and pay damages awarded against the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners filed petitions in the county court against the county, seeking damages for a barrier constructed that destroyed their only means of ingress and egress to and from an intersection of highways. The Department then filed its action seeking a restraining order, which was denied on appeal. The court held that the landowners' suits against the county did not claim that their property had been taken or physically damaged for a public purpose, but that their suits were based entirely on the proposition that the value of their properties was depreciated solely because of the loss of access from the highways in consequence of the construction of a State-aid road not adjoining their lands, but over which the Department had assumed exclusive jurisdiction. The court held that under the circumstances, Ga. Code &sect; 95-1712 did not offend the Ga. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3, para. 1. The court held that because Ga. Code &sect; 95-1712 was not subject to the constitutional attacks, the county judge erred in holding that the landowners' suits pending in county court had not been prematurely instituted and that the landowners should be permitted to proceed with their prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exception is to the judgment of the Superior Court of Muscogee County denying the injunctive relief prayed for and dismissing the petition.  The sole relief sought by the petition is to enjoin the defendant, State Highway Department, from removing described improvements from land which the plaintiff alleges the defendant is seeking to condemn under authority of the act of the General Assembly, approved March 13, 1957 (Ga. L. 1957, p. 387 et seq.; Code, Ann., &sect;&sect; 36-601a -- 36-616a), until a final determination and award have been made in the pending condemnation proceedings, and until the plaintiff has been paid just and adequate compensation.  He contends that, although he is permitted an appeal from the award made by the master, to permit removal of the buildings from his land prior to the trial of his case on appeal, will prevent his establishing the value of his property on the jury trial.  The petition as amended alleges that section 13 of the 1957 act, supra, denies the plaintiff the right to be first paid just and adequate compensation before the taking of his property, in violation of art. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1, sec. 3, par. 1, of the Constitution of Georgia (Code &sect; 2-301).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court in its order denying the relief and dismissing the petition made the following findings of fact: that, at the interlocutory hearing on December 5, 1959, it was established that the special master had made an award on December 3, 1959, in the amount of $ 50,000 to be paid to several persons (one of whom was the plaintiff); that the return of the special master had been filed with the court; that, on December 4, 1959, the $ 50,000 awarded by the special master had been paid into the registry of the court; and that, prior to the interlocutory hearing, the return of the special master had been made the judgment of the court.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court had previously made an award to several persons including the condemnee. On appeal, the court held that deposit of the compensation assessed by the special master into the court as provided by 1957 Ga. Laws 387, &sect; 13, satisfied the constitutional requirement that the condemnee receive adequate compensation. The court found that it could not say that the legislature abused its discretion in providing that upon payment into the court registry the trial court could enter judgment vesting fee-simple title in the condemnor. The court ruled that the taking was complete when the trial court acting under 1957 Ga. Laws 387, &sect; 13, entered judgment condemning the property and vesting title in the condemnor. The court noted that upon trial the issue was the value of the property at the time it was condemned and titled vested in the condemnor.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it was not error to sustain the general denial of the paragraph in which the city officials were to produce certain books and records at the trial, because it was evasive and it had not alleged what documents the city officials did not have and could not produce at the trial.

The court reversed the sales tax refund granted in favor of the taxpayer. The court reasoned that the tax imposed by the Act was on the retailer for the privilege of engaging in the retail business in the state. The failure of the retailer to collect the tax did not relieve him from paying the tax. The court strictly construed tax exemptions. The Act excluded sales that cannot constitutionally be used as a base of the tax. Since the tax was upon the retailer, a tax was not levied against the sale to the United States, which the state would not have authority to tax. Thus, the Act did not violate the immunity of the United States from state taxation, provided by the U.S. Constitution. There was also no merit to the argument that the Act violated the U.S. Const. art 6, cl. 2. Further, the Act did not violate equal protection because there was no showing that the State Revenue Commissioner could not collect the tax on sales made to the United States. Any discrimination resulted from the federal constitution, which was a superior authority to the Act.</SPAN></P>

Laws 564 et seq., as being unconstitutional. The court noted that in order to raise a question as to the constitutionality of a law, the statute which was challenged and the provision of the constitution alleged to have been violated must both be clearly specified. The license holders' petition attacked the statute as amended but did not provide when it was amended, where it was amended, or how it was amended. The court also determined that the petition did not point out definitely the act or portion of the act under attack. The court was not required to take judicial notice of the acts of the legislature. Therefore, the court concluded that the attack upon the Structural Pest Control Act as amended was insufficient to raise any constitutional question as to any act of the legislature. Finally, the court determined that the Commission had the authority to establish regulations and that the regulation in question that applied to the license holders had been validly enacted.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the county's general demurrers to the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding (1) the Act of 1957 provided an adequate method for determining just and adequate compensation for property sought to be condemned and was not inconsistent with Ga. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3, para. 1, and, therefore, the Act was not unconstitutional, (2) the county commissioners' reliance on various advisory committees in rendering the decision to condemn the property was not illegal and its authorization of the condemnation did not constitute an unlawful delegation of authority, and (3) there was no showing that the county abused its discretion or acted in bad faith.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This suit was brought to recover damages by an ultimate consumer against a manufacturer for breach of implied warranty, under the provisions of Ga. L. 1957, p. 405 (Code, Ann., &sect; 96-307), which provides: &quot;The manufacturer of any personal property sold as new property, either directly or through wholesale or retail dealers, or any other person, shall warrant the following to the ultimate consumer, who, however, must exercise caution when purchasing to detect defects, and provided there is no express covenant of warranty and no agreement to the contrary: 1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a breach of implied warranty action by the consumer against the manufacturer, the manufacturer argued that &sect; 96-307 was unconstitutional as violative of equal protection. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. On the consumer's appeal, the court reversed, holding that the act applied alike to all manufacturers of personal property and that it was reasonable to classify manufacturers apart from other remote sellers for the purposes of the legislation. The manufacturer had control over the materials and production methods used, labor and workmanship, and quality control procedures. This control would not be present in other remote sellers. The statute also did not interfere with liberty of contract because the act was not contractual. An implied warranty added nothing to the agreement of the parties, but simply stated the legal consequences attached to a described transaction. It was not dependent on any contract either in fact or by implication.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the conspiracy which &sect; 26-4201 prohibited and punished was clearly a substantive penal offense in Georgia, which did not offend the due process clause of the Constitution of the United States or the due-process provision of Georgia's Constitution.

The county's answer admitted the correctness of the amount in controversy, and claimed a right to the funds.

A total divorce was granted to both parties by a decree of DeKalb Superior Court on December 22, 1955, in an uncontested action brought by the defendant against the plaintiff; and at the time of the final decree, the custody of the children was awarded to the defendant in the present case, the plaintiff in that case.  There is in effect no valid order providing for the payment by the defendant of support for the two minor children.  The plaintiff brings her action under and by virtue of an act approved March 21, 1958 (Ga. L. 1958, pp. 204-206), and prays that the court, after hearing evidence as to the needs of the children and the ability of the father to provide therefor, pass an order fixing the amount of support money that he shall provide in order&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to fulfill his natural duty to supply the necessaries of life for the children.  The plaintiff further prays for a rule nisi requiring the defendant to show cause why such order should not be passed, and for process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant filed a general demurrer on the following grounds: (1) The petition fails to set forth a cause of action against the defendant.  (2) The act approved March 21, 1958 (Ga. L. 1958, pp. 204-206) is unconstitutional and void, being in violation of the Constitution of Georgia, art. I, sec. III, par. II (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-302), if applied to a divorce case or any other case concerning the support of minor children in which a final judgment has been rendered prior to the passage of the act, for the reason that, as so applied, the act would be retroactive.  (3) The petition shows that there has been a final decree of divorce between the parties, and subsequently to this decree an order was passed awarding the custody of the minor children to the plaintiff; and for this reason the rights of the parties have been fixed in a solemn judgment, and the petition sets forth no cause of action against the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the grounds of the demurrer were sustained by the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trial judge, and the petition was dismissed.  The exception is to that judgment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother and father were divorced and custody was awarded to the mother. She filed a petition seeking child support under O.C.G.A. &sect; 30-301, which was passed after the final judgment of divorce was entered. The Act allowed for entry of orders fixing amounts for child support. The trial court sustained the father's demurrer and dismissed the mother's petition. On appeal, the court held that the mother's petition alleged sufficient facts to have brought it within the provisions of the Act, as the Act did not require that the children should be in a destitute condition because of the father's failure to provide them with necessaries. The court determined that the Act, when applied to the case, created no new obligation and took away no vested defense, the procedure for enforcing the already existing obligation of the father to take care of his children had changed, but the court held that the General Assembly had the power to change the remedy for enforcing an existing obligation without making the Act retroactive in violation of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, para. 2. The court found that the trial court erred in sustaining the father's demurrer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer argued that under Ga. Code. Ann. &sect; 92-3113(4)(c), gross receipts for tax purposes included only receipts from shipments made from the tax payer's plant to its bottlers located within the state. The tax commissioner argued that &sect; 92-3113(4)(c), when construed with the remainder of the statute and with Ga. Code. Ann. &sect; 92-3002(n), meant that where products were produced, manufactured or stored within the state and shipped to customers outside the state, the gross receipts derived therefrom were to be included in the tax payer's gross receipts for tax purposes. The court rejected the tax commissioner's argument and affirmed the decisions of the lower court and the trial court. The court pointed out that an amendment to the tax statute eliminated the provision that the sales ratio included all sales made within the state to all sales made everywhere including outside the state and substituted a gross receipts ratio in its place. The court concluded that the legislature intended, by its amendment, to provide that gross receipts be deprived from products shipped or delivered to customers within the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court that upheld the trial court's decision that the tax payer's tax liability was based only of gross receipts for products shipped or delivered from its plant to customers within the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, by next friend, sought review of a decision by the Superior Court of Grady County (Georgia), which overruled defendant's traverse of service, the plea to the jurisdiction, and the general demurrers in plaintiff's action for damages. Defendant argued that O.C.G.A. &sect; 68-808 denied defendant due process of law and was therefore in violation of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. III and also in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the Act of 1957, amending the Act of 1937, being the Non-resident Motorist Act and of which O.C.G.A. &sect; 68-808 was a part, was in violation of Ga. Const. art. III, para. VIII. Defendant maintained that because O.C.G.A. &sect; 68-808 was unconstitutional, he had never been legally served, had never waived service, had designated nor appointed no one as agent to accept service for him, and had never appeared or pleaded. The court was of the opinion that the court of appeals had jurisdiction to review the writ of error. Under Ga. Const. art. 6, &sect; 2, para. 4, (O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-3704), the question of jurisdiction depended upon whether the constitutionality of any law of Georgia was in question. In order to raise a question as to the constitutionality of a law, the statute that defendant asserted to contravene the Constitution and the provisions of the constitution alleged to have been violated had to be clearly identified, and it had to be shown wherein the statute violated such constitutional provisions. Defendant's claims were too vague and general to identify the &quot;law&quot; claimed to be invalid or to show wherein and how the same violated the constitution.</SPAN></P>

Laws 312, 315; O.C.G.A. &sect; 34A-137, amending the Electric Membership Corporation Act of 1937, 1937 Ga. Laws 644; O.C.G.A. &sect; 34A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners claimed that &sect; 3 of the Act of 1939, regarding limitations periods for rights-of-way by corporations, was unconstitutional as being in violation of the Due Process Clause in that it would allow the corporation to take property of the owners other than by due process of law. They also asserted that &sect; 3 was a special act seeking to vary a general law in violation of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; IV, para. I, without the free consent of the owners who were incapable of consent. The court found that the contention that the Act was unconstitutional in violation of the Due Process Clause was insufficient to invoke any court ruling. Further, the 1939 amendment was an amendment of a general law. The contention that the 1939 amendment was unconstitutional and void, as a special act varying the rights under a general law without the owners' consent, could not be sustained. The fixing of periods of limitation to operate in futuro was peculiarly a matter of legislative control. Moreover, &sect; 3 conformed to the title of the Act and was not subject to the objection that the amendatory act referred to more than one subject matter and contained matter different from that expressed in the title.</SPAN></P>

The Board's action was brought under the provisions of O.C.G.A. &sect; 84-702 (as amended by 1956 Ga. Laws 25), which appellant claimed was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant contended that O.C.G.A. &sect; 84-702 (as amended by 1956 Ga.

I, &sect; 4, para. 1, which prohibited special laws when a general law already existed. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court noted that the practice of dentistry was a profession imbued with public interest and, therefore, was subject to reasonable regulation. The court concluded that &sect; 2-401 only required a law to apply, uniformly, to all persons, matters, or things which it was intended to affect. The court found that O.C.G.A. &sect; 84-702 (as amended by 1956 Ga. Laws 25) met this standard since any person, firm, or corporation who undertook to practice dentistry without a license could be enjoined upon a petition brought by the Board. This statute, enacted by the general assembly as a means to regulate the dental profession, had uniform application and was reasonably calculated to obtain the desired regulation. Thus, &sect; 84-702 was a general and not a special law, and the trial court properly overruled appellant's demurrer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The pedestrian brought a personal injury action against the owner and the driver. The court observed that if the pedestrian was entitled to recovery from the owner, it was by reason of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 68-301 because the petition clearly sought recovery from the owner on the basis that the driver was driving the car with her consent and for her benefit. The petition did not seek recovery from the owner on the basis of principal and agent, nor did it allege facts showing that the driver was her agent acting within the scope of his employment. The court held that &sect; 68-301 violated the due process clause of both the United States and the Georgia Constitution because it made a vehicle owner liable if the vehicle was being used in the prosecution of the business of or for the benefit of the owner, even though operated without notice to her or without her knowledge or consent. To allow any recovery on the basis of &sect; 68-301 would deprive a defendant of property without due process of law, would authorize a recovery without liability, and would compel payment without fault. The owner was in a position to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 68-301 because she was adversely affected by it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case number 20262, Herbert P. Womack, Jr., alleging the pendency in the City Court of Jefferson of a criminal case against him, sought an injunction against the judge, solicitor, clerk, and sheriff of that court, together with the three county commissioners of Jackson County, alleging that the act (Ga. L. 1903, p. 138) creating the City Court of Jefferson is unconstitutional and void, because sec. 31 thereof provides for the judge of the superior court to send down from the superior court to the city court for trial all misdemeanor presentments and indictments which may not be disposed of at the end of the term of the superior court by pleas, and sec. 32 provides that all justices of the peace and notaries public of the county shall bind over to the city court all misdemeanor cases.  The petition alleges that these sections offend the provisions of the Constitution (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-401) requiring uniformity.  The prayer is for injunction prohibiting each defendant from operating the City Court of Jefferson, and a decree declaring the entire city court act unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  number 20260, Charles Waters alleges that there is pending in the City Court of Jefferson a criminal case against him.  He names the judge, solicitor, and the sheriff of that court as defendants and attacks the city court act above in its entirety upon the same alleged unconstitutional provisions as in the above case, and seeks the same relief by injunction and decree that the city court act is unconstitutional and void.  Two persons, alleging themselves to be citizens and taxpayers, were by an ex parte order allowed to intervene, and that order, issued at chambers, is excepted to here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon presentation of the petition in the latter case on July 3, 1958, a rule nisi issued setting an interlocutory hearing on September 5, 1958, and in the meantime the defendants were restrained as prayed.  In the first case the rule nisi issued on August 5, 1958, setting an interlocutory hearing on September 5, 1958, and in the meantime restrained the defendants as prayed.  On August 7, 1958, the intervention was allowed subject to objection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 2, 1958, an ex parte order was issued by the judge, reciting that the plaintiff Womack was seriously ill and unable to appear at court for several&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  months, and counsel for the plaintiffs are engaged in other courts, and ordered that the above-stated cases -- there being above the order an entry stating the parties in both cases -- &quot;be removed from the trial calendar of Sept. 5, 1958, and that the same be reset by further order of the court.  In the meantime, the restraining orders heretofore issued in said cases shall remain in full force and effect.  Let the clerk notify all parties of interest in said cases of this order.  Maylon B. Clinkscales, Judge, Superior Courts Piedmont Circuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants in each case tendered to the judge on September 9, 1958, bills of exceptions and each was approved by the judge on September 16, 1958.  Errors are assigned on the ex parte order of September 2, 1958, on the ex parte orders of July 3, 1958, and August 5, 1958, restraining the defendants, and the order of August 7, 1958, allowing the intervention.  The defendants in error in each case have moved to dismiss the writs of error upon the grounds that they are premature and except to no reviewable judgments.  </SPAN></P>

Appellees also challenged an order allowing two citizens to intervene in the defendants' action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two defendants, facing criminal charges in a city court, sought an injunction prohibiting the city court's officials from operating that court and a declaration that the act creating the court was unconstitutional. The trial court issued a temporary restraining order preventing the prosecution of defendants and allowed two citizens to intervene in the case. The court reversed. The court observed that the constitutionality of the act creating the court in question was settled law and could not be seriously questioned. Even were the constitutional questions valid, the court noted that, under O.C.G.A. &sect; 55-102, equity could take no part in the administration of criminal law and could neither aid, restrain, nor obstruct criminal courts in the exercise of their jurisdiction. Violation of this statute could not be justified by allegations that the entire law creating the city court was unconstitutional. Since there were no allegations showing invalidity of the act creating the city court, an injunction could not prevent the performance of the duties imposed upon the city court's officials by that act.</SPAN></P>

The court held that an express statutory provision was not indispensable to the associations' capacity to sue and be sued. The court noted that the associations were licensed as rating organizations under the provisions of Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 56-20, 56-21. The court found that under Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 56-2004(b), 56-2104(b), insurers had to be a member of, or subscribe to a licensed rating organization. The court held that the statutes recognized the associations as legal entities regarding rating issues.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, an arresting officer and related parties, challenged a judgment from the Toombs Superior Court (Georgia), which overruled the general demurrers to the amended petition, held that the 1958 amendment of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 56-601 was not applicable to plaintiff arrestee's action instituted in 1957, and held that even if it was applicable, it was unconstitutional and void as applied to this action for damages arising from an illegal arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The arresting officer arrested the arrestee without a warrant. The court held that the 1958 amendment of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 56-601 was not applicable to the arrestee's action, which was instituted in 1957 and was pending at the time of its passage. The amendment had only a prospective application. Defendants asserted that the amended petition failed to set forth a cause of action for illegal arrest because it contained no allegations that, at the time of the arrest, the arrestee was not endeavoring to escape and there was not likely to be a failure of justice for want of an officer to issue a warrant. The arrestee alleged that he had not committed any act in violation of any law, had committed no act or crime in the presence of the officer who had no warrant for his arrest, and that his arrest was wrongful, illegal, malicious, and without probable cause. Whether grounds for a warrantless arrest existed was a matter of defense and defendants had the burden of proof on that issue. There was no merit to that ground of the demurrer. The trial court properly overruled the special demurrer, as the arrestee could recover both smart money and attorney's fees under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 89-421.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition for injunction in the present case is brought by the Mayor of the City of Nicholls against the aldermen and marshal of that city.  It is asserted: The petitioner is the duly elected mayor of the city for the year 1958.  The aldermen have conspired together to divest the petitioner of his right and authority as the supreme executive officer of the city, and they have delivered to him a notice that a hearing will be had in the city hall at 7:30 o'clock p. m. on May 5, 1958, to hear evidence on the question of impeachment of the petitioner under section 16 of the city charter.  (This notice, attached as an exhibit to the petition, listed six specific charges against the petitioner of crimes and misconduct).  The notice was maliciously published, and the statements contained therein are false, defamatory, and libelous.  &quot;There has been no enabling ordinance adopted by the legislative department of the City of Nicholls rendering operative the provisions of said section 16, without which its provisions are impotent and without effect.  By itself considered, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nor when considered with the remaining sections, said section 16 of the charter act of the City of Nicholls is not susceptible of being rendered retroactively enforceable by enabling ordinance.  Any effort so to do would be violative of article I, section I, paragraph II, of the Constitution of Georgia, which is: 'Protection to person and property is a [the] paramount duty of government, and shall be impartial and complete;' and article I, section I, paragraph III, of the Constitution of Georgia, which is: 'No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, and [or] property except by due process of law;' article V [Amendments] of the Constitution of the United States of America, which in part is: 'No person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.'&quot; The defendants have &quot;arrogated unto themselves the right to accuse, to constitute the personnel of the forum of trial, to become and be the triors of this petitioner, and to execute judgment based upon triors' findings, all of which is contrary to every recognized principle of justice and jurisprudence obtaining in these United States of America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition prayed: that the hearing provided&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for in the notice be enjoined; that the defendants be restrained from doing any act involving his tenure of office, and from uttering or circulating by utterance matters derogatory of the petitioner as it involves his office; and for other and further relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge granted an order temporarily restraining the impeachment hearing.  The defendants filed a general demurrer, to the petition, which was sustained.  The exception is to that judgment.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mayor contended that no enabling ordinance adopted by the legislative department of the city rendered operative the provisions of a city charter authorizing impeachment proceedings, and he sought to enjoin an impeachment hearing. The court held that the trial court did not err when it denied the injunction because a court of equity could not interfere in cases involving merely the question of title to an office. The mayor did not attack the constitutionality of the charter provisions authorizing impeachment proceedings, and he was given notice of the impeachment hearing, so his due process argument was without merit. The legislature had designated members of a board of aldermen as the proper forum for hearing impeachment proceedings, so the mayor was not denied due process of law by reason that the aldermen were prejudiced against him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 17, 1957, Deroy Floyd, as administrator of the estate of his deceased wife, Mamie M. Floyd, filed his petition against Complete Auto Transit, Inc., in which he sought recovery of damages of $ 50,000 for pain and suffering of his deceased wife, and medical, hospital and funeral expenses in the sum of $ 972.  He alleged that the deceased was injured on July 27, 1955, when the tractor on which she was riding was struck from the rear by a transport unit of the defendant; that she suffered excruciating pain from the date of her injury until her death on August 7, 1955, and incurred medical, hospital and funeral expenses; and that her injury and death were the result of the defendant's negligence.  On July 11, 1957, the defendant filed a plea in bar in which it was alleged that prior to her death the deceased had not filed suit for pain and suffering and therefore any action she might have had therefor did not survive to her administrator; that the husband and ten children of the deceased had previously filed suit in the Federal court for the full value of the deceased's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  life in which case judgment was rendered in their favor for $ 107,500; and that that suit was a bar to the present action for pain and suffering.  On July 11, 1957, the defendant also filed an answer generally denying the allegations of the petition and, in the &quot;fifth defense&quot; thereof, making the same contentions as made in the plea in bar.  Likewise, on the same date, the defendant demurred generally on the ground that the petition stated no cause of action and demurred specially on the ground of a misjoinder of causes of action.  In its demurrers the defendant demurred generally to paragraphs 13 and 15 of the petition, which contained allegations as to the cause of action for pain and suffering, and also to paragraph 14, which set forth the cause of action for medical, hospital and funeral expenses.  On July 15, 1957, the plaintiff filed a demurrer to and motion to strike the defendant's plea in bar on the ground that it did not set out any defense either in law or in equity and on the same date demurred to and moved to strike the &quot;fifth defense&quot; of the answer.  On February 8, 1958, the defendant filed a defensive pleading denominated &quot;Elaboration of an Amendment to the Original&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Demurrers,&quot; which attacked paragraphs 13 and 15 of the petition on certain constitutional grounds and prayed that said paragraphs be stricken, and which also attacked paragraph 14 on constitutional grounds and prayed that it be stricken.  On February 8, the plaintiff amended his petition striking therefrom paragraph 14 (the allegations which sought recovery for medical, hospital and funeral expenses) and adding count 2 in which he sought recovery for these items.  Thereafter, on the same date, the defendant filed a renewal of its demurrers.  At a hearing on February 8, 1958, the trial court sustained the plaintiff's demurrers and motions to strike the plea in bar and the &quot;fifth defense&quot; of the answer and overruled all the defendant's demurrers to the amended petition.  To these rulings adverse to it the defendant excepts.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the demurrers and the plea in abatement. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that recovery on behalf of the father and children of decedent against the vehicle owner did not constitute a bar to the administrator's action. The court held that an amendment to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 3-505 was not unconstitutional and did not violate Ga. Const., art. 3, &sect; 7, para.8. The court ruled, however, that the administrator did not have a cause of action for negligent homicide because an act of the general assembly that conferred upon the wife's administrator the right to recover for medical, hospital, and funeral expenses deprived a defendant of his property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a natural gas company, appealed a decision of the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia), which denied its motion for a new trial following a judgment in favor of defendants, the Georgia Public Service Commission, its five members, and a competitor that was granted a certificate of public convenience and necessity, on its action seeking to enjoin and set aside the Commission's order granting the certificate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following the enactment of 1956 Ga. Laws 104, the competitor filed an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct and operate a gas pipeline system. The natural gas company objected, asserting that the act under which the application was made is was invalid and unconstitutional. The Commission granted the certificate and retained jurisdiction. The trial court denied the natural gas company's request to enjoin the order of the Commission, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The record affirmatively showed that the natural gas company, as an interstate distributor, did not serve the area served by the competitor and had no application for a certificate which would authorize it to do so. It was not adversely affected by the provisions of 1956 Ga. Laws 104, which related only to an intrastate gas business, nor was it injured in any way by the certificate of public convenience and necessity which the Commission granted to the competitor. Consequently, it was in no position to attack the constitutionality of the act. Because it was not adversely affected by the Commission's order, it also could not question the sufficiency of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commissioners brought suit against the ordinary claiming he failed to remit the sum of $ 1 for each marriage license he sold. Defendant demurred, claiming that the statute requiring the collection and payment of $ 1 from each license sold to be paid into the ordinaries' retirement system was unconstitutional as it imposed a tax only upon persons seeking marriage licenses for the benefit of a particular and limited class of citizens. The trial court sustained the ordinary's demurrer and the court affirmed, finding that the statute requiring collection of the $ 1was unconstitutional. The fees allowed to be charged for the issuance of a marriage license were fixed by law and no part of that statutory fee was to be paid into the retirement fund. Instead, on the issuance of the license, the ordinary was required to charge an additional dollar, which would be paid into the retirement fund. Such being the case, the collection of this extra dollar was not for the purpose of compensating the ordinary for a service rendered, but was for the purpose of raising revenue for the expenses of operating the retirement board and paying benefits to retired ordinaries, and was a tax, not a fee.</SPAN></P>

The persons named whose property rights were sought to be taken, or otherwise affected, were Mrs. Esther Ann Lyon Martin and the Clerk of the Superior Court, the Tax Commissioner, and the Tax Collector, of Fulton County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge passed an order requiring the defendants to appear before him on a given date.

Nealy to reinvest homestead funds, and the consummation of the reinvestment is recorded (in a designated book).  The granting of the homestead has never been revoked or annulled.  Mrs. Octavia N. Nealy died in 1921 and the property passed by will to her son, Claude Nealy, who had married Mrs. Martin's sister.  In 1936 Mrs. Martin and her son moved into the home and became a part of the family enjoying the homestead property.  Mrs. Martin is now the sole owner of the homestead property, being the property sought to be condemned.  The condemnation case, being a proceeding in rem against the property, is in violation of Code &sect; 51-101, prohibiting any judgment, execution, or decree against homestead property, except for the purposes named in the section.  The condemnation case is also proceeding illegally because the property sought to be condemned is within the City of Atlanta, a municipality, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and yet the condemnation is not being instituted by the City of Atlanta, and no concurrence or consent of the city for the condemnation of the land is shown.  Fulton County is not constructing or planning to construct a highway at the place where the property sought to be condemned is located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayers of the cross-bill were that Fulton County be temporarily and permanently enjoined from condemning the property sought to be condemned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge entered an order in which he overruled the general and special demurrers of Mrs. Martin to the condemnation petition, except for two special demurrers.  In the same order he sustained the written motion of Fulton County to strike the cross-bill and prayers for injunction of Mrs. Martin.  In her bill of exceptions Mrs. Martin excepts to all of the rulings adverse to her in the order.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county instituted a condemnation proceeding against the landowner's property under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 36-11. The landowner filed general and special demurrers and sought to enjoin the county from condemning her property, alleging that she held the property under a constitutional homestead. The property had been placed under homestead and passed by will to the son of the original owner, who had married the landowner's sister. The landowner and her son then moved into the home and also enjoyed the homestead property. At the time of the suit, the landowner was the sole owner. The trial court overruled her demurrers and struck her cross-bill alleging a homestead and her motion for injunctive relief. On appeal, the court reversed cases holding that a condemnee could not file a bill of exceptions to a decision overruling demurrers to a condemnation petition and held that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 95-17A authorized the state and its subdivisions to acquire property for limited access roads, and that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 95-1721 imposed a duty on the county to acquire the necessary rights-of-way.

The court ruled that the enactment of the Act of 1957 did not represent an abuse of legislative discretion. In reaching this conclusion, the court noted that the statute fairly and adequately protected the constitutional rights of the owner of property condemned for public purposes by providing for just and adequate compensation to be first paid before the property was taken.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action for tax refund.  Before Judge Shaw.  Fulton Superior Court.  July 19, 1957.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was an action brought by Stockham Valves &amp; Fittings, Inc., (hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff) against T. V. Williams as Revenue Commissioner of the State of Georgia, to recover income taxes paid by the plaintiff under protest to the State for the calendar years 1952, 1954, and 1955, assessed against the plaintiff under the following Georgia Income Tax Statutes: Code (Ann.) &sect; 92-3102, which provides that &quot;Every domestic corporation and every foreign corporation shall pay annually an income tax equivalent to four per cent. of the net income from property owned or from business done in Georgia, as defined in section 92-3113&quot;; and Code (Ann.) &sect; 92-3113, which provides that &quot;The tax imposed by this law shall apply to the entire net income, as herein defined, received by every corporation, foreign or domestic, owning property or doing business in this State.  Every such corporation shall be deemed to be doing business within this State if it engages within this State in any activities or transactions for the purpose of financial profit or gain, whether&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or not such corporation qualifies to do business in this State, and whether or not it maintains an office or place of doing business within this State, and whether or not any such activity or transaction is connected with interstate or foreign commerce.&quot; Claims for a refund of the taxes paid having been denied by the defendant, the present suit was brought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff contends that all of its activities within the State of Georgia are a part of and inseparable from interstate commerce, and that any income tax assessed against the plaintiff is a direct burden on such commerce and violates the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution (Code &sect; 1-125 (3)); that the fact that the plaintiff maintains one sales-service office in Georgia and one of its sales representatives spends one-third of his time in Georgia does not make the plaintiff present in the State in any substantial sense, and an attempt to subject it to an income tax violates the due-process clause of the Federal Constitution (Code &sect; 1-815).  No question is raised by the plaintiff as to the reasonableness of the apportionment of its net income to Georgia under the prescribed statutory apportionment formula or to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  amount of taxes, if liable; but the plaintiff contends that the State is without jurisdiction to impose a net income tax upon a foreign corporation engaged within Georgia in exclusively interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts were stipulated, and the issue was submitted to the trial judge without a jury; and to the judgment upholding the validity of the statute and the tax the plaintiff excepts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the stipulation of facts it appears that the plaintiff is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware with its principal or home office and its manufacturing plant located in Birmingham, Alabama.  Since 1905, and including the tax years in question, it has been engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling valves and pipe fittings and in promoting the sale and use of valves and pipe fittings which it manufactured.  For the tax years in question, it maintained inventories of its products in established warehouses at Birmingham, Ala., Philadelphia, Pa., Chicago, Ill., Houston, Tex., and Vernon, Calif.  It maintained established sales-service offices at the foregoing locations and also at Cambridge, Mass., New York, N. Y., Atlanta, Ga., Pittsburgh, Pa., San Francisco, Calif., Washington, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  D. C., Dallas, Tex., and St. Louis, Mo. Purchasers of plaintiff's valves and pipe fittings were located in all the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a matter of policy and practice, during the tax years in question, the plaintiff made sales only to established local wholesalers and jobbers and (except for sales to makers of automatic-sprinkler systems) made no sales directly to users and installers of valves and pipe fittings.  The local wholesalers and jobbers who handled the plaintiff's products, however, were in no way tied in or committed by any type of license, franchise, or other authorized or exclusive dealership arrangement, to the distribution of the plaintiff's products.  Any established local wholesaler or jobber, having established credit, was considered as a prospective customer and could buy from the plaintiff.  Established local wholesalers and jobbers who did buy from the plaintiff were entirely free to discontinue buying from it at any time and for any reason; they were also free to deal in competitive products and usually did handle one or more lines of competing products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff, during the years in question, made no sales on a consignment basis and maintained no inventories&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of its own at any place except at the aforesaid warehouses, none of which were located in Georgia.  Through its sales representative, it encouraged every local wholesaler and jobber who handled its products to carry a local inventory, and to those local wholesalers and jobbers who did maintain a local inventory of valves, it gave a price concession, which was not available to wholesalers and jobbers who did not.  Pipe fittings were, however, sold at uniform prices whether or not carried in inventory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All orders for the plaintiff's products were contractually accepted or rejected at the home office of the plaintiff in Birmingham, Alabama.  No representative of the company at any sales-service office had any authority to, or did, contractually accept or reject any order under any circumstances.  Contractual authority was vested exclusively in the home office in Birmingham, Alabama.  For the most part, orders were received by mail at the company's home office in Birmingham directly from wholesalers and jobbers.  Such orders as were received at sales-service offices, or by the solicitation of sales representatives working out of sales-service offices, were relayed by mail, telephone or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  teletype to the home office at Birmingham for contractual acceptance or rejection.  Some such orders were rejected by the home office for credit or other reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff had no plant or warehouse in Georgia.  All sales were made on an &quot;f.o.b. warehouse&quot; basis, and were completed at the plant or warehouse by deliveries to customers or to common carriers consigned to customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1950, and during the tax years in question, the plaintiff maintained a sales-service office in Atlanta.  One of its sales representatives used this office as his headquarters.  He worked in a territory which included Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and parts of Tennessee and Virginia.  Part of Florida was also included in his territory until 1954.  This representative spent approximately one-third of his time at the Atlanta sales office or traveling in the State of Georgia.  The other two-thirds of his time was spent traveling outside of Georgia.  He was paid a salary plus a commission on the amount of business derived from the territory served by the Atlanta office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff also employed at its sales-service office in Atlanta a full-time woman secretary.  She functioned on the basis&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of her own knowledge and experience and literature furnished by the company as a source of information concerning the plaintiff's products.  She performed stenographic and clerical duties and facilitated communications between the plaintiff's home office in Birmingham, the plaintiff's sales representative when he was out in the territory, and customers, prospective customers, contractors, and users of the plaintiff's products.  She operated the teletype machine and sometimes obtained information from Birmingham to give to architects, engineers, or other people interested in the plaintiff's products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Atlanta sales-service office was listed in the Atlanta telephone directories in the plaintiff's name in both the alphabetical and classified business listings.  The office was listed in the plaintiff's name in the Atlanta city directories.  The company, on its sales-service office letterheads, in its catalogues and discount sheets, and on some promotional material, listed the fact that it maintained a sales-service office in Atlanta.  A small amount of office furniture was maintained there of the approximate value of $ 1,000.  The representative carried on the ordinary duties of a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  salesman in Georgia.  No orders were, however, accepted within the State of Georgia.  All sales were completed at warehouses outside of the State by deliveries to customers or to common carriers consigned to customers.  All such sales took place outside of Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At no time during the tax years in question did the plaintiff qualify to do business within the State of Georgia; no officer or director of the plaintiff was a resident of Georgia; the Atlanta sales representative was a resident of the State.  During the tax years in question, rent, salaries, and all other expenses of the Atlanta office were paid by check drawn by officers located at the home office on bank accounts of the company in banks outside the State of Georgia.  No employee of the plaintiff in Georgia had authority, either alone or with any other person, to draw checks upon or make withdrawals from any bank account of the company.  Expense accounts of employees at the Atlanta office were forwarded to the home office, where they were reviewed and paid by checks.  The plaintiff kept no bank account in the State of Georgia.  All credit matters were handled at the plaintiff's Alabama office, where credit information&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was obtained and all credit questions were passed on.  All invoices were prepared and mailed from and all collections were made by the plaintiff's office in Alabama.  No employee of the plaintiff in Georgia had authority to accept nor did any employee accept any order, bind plaintiff to furnish goods, arrange credit terms, or make collections.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carlton Brown brought suit in Stewart County Superior Court against The Ledger-Enquirer Company, a newspaper publishing corporation which has its principal office in Columbus, Muscogee County, Georgia, alleging that said corporation in its newspaper, the Columbus Enquirer, had published false and libelous matter of and concerning the plaintiff, for which he sought damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition as amended alleged as follows: &quot;The Ledger-Enquirer Company is a corporation engaged in publishing newspapers in the State of Georgia and said corporation has circulation of its newspaper, the Columbus Enquirer, in more than one county of said State.  The said newspaper is circulated in Stewart County, Georgia, by being regularly delivered to more than fifty (50) subscribers therein.  The named corporation has no agent or place of business in Stewart County, Georgia but has its principal office in this State located at Columbus, Muscogee County, Georgia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant corporation filed its general demurrer to the original petition and renewed its demurrers to the petition as amended, in which, among other&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  things, it attacked the jurisdiction of the Superior Court of Stewart County.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant in error alleged that the newspaper published false and libelous matter concerning him. On appeal of the overruling of the newspaper's demurrers to the jurisdiction, the court noted that 1956 Ga. Laws 4-6 was to establish venue in actions for damages against certain corporations and to fix the residences of such corporations. The classification was corporations, publishing newspapers, magazines, and periodicals having a circulation in more than one county in Georgia. The court found no reasonable relation of the classification made to the purpose of the act. There was no legitimate ground of differentiation between a corporation that published a newspaper and regularly delivered it to more than 50 subscribers in a county and such corporation which regularly sold its publication to more than 50 persons in a county by methods other than subscription. The harm done to the person libeled was just as great either way. The act was unconstitutional and void, and the trial court had no jurisdiction over the newspaper.</SPAN></P>

The county filed the litigation against the sheriff for the return of money collected by the sheriff as fines, forfeitures, and costs, which were not paid over to the officers of the county as required by a Georgia local salary act approved on February 12, 1952.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the sheriff argued that the county's petition as amended failed to state a cause of action because the Act, which placed the office of sheriff on a salary basis, was unconstitutional. The Act was a local or special one and its constitutionality was attacked on the ground that notice of the authors' intention to introduce it in the General Assembly was not published as required by O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-7902; Ga. Const. of 1945, art. XII, &sect; 2, para. 2. The court held that the Act was unconstitutional. Reversing the judgment, the court found that it was necessary to publish the notice once a week for three weeks during a period of 60 days immediately preceding the date of its introduction in the General Assembly. In order to have complied with the provision of the Constitution requiring such publication, it was necessary that each publication of it be a legal one. The Act showed that the first publication of the notice was on &quot;Saturday, December 9, 1951,&quot; but that day was a Sunday. The court held that where the law required publication of a notice as a condition precedent to the doing of some act, its publication on a Sunday was not legal and amounted to no publication at all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action to enjoin the City of Marietta, a political subdivision of the State of Georgia, from condemning the petitioner's property for street purposes under the authority of the in rem provisions of Code Ch. 36-11 (Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., pp. 251-255).  Petitioner alleges in substance: that the defendant is proceeding illegally under an illegal resolution which authorizes its attorney to exercise the city's power of eminent domain, has failed to pass necessary ordinances and resolutions specifying the manner in which petitioner's property could be condemned, and no appropriate method of condemnation has been adopted, is proceeding illegally contrary to the due process clause of the Constitution of Georgia, is not entitled to proceed under the in rem petition because petitioner's title to the property is not in doubt, and a judgment ascertaining such question is unnecessary; that the assessor for the city was appointed prematurely; that existing ordinances require all streets to be 50 feet wide, and the land to be condemned for street purposes is only 40 feet wide; that there is no&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  necessity to acquire petitioner's property, and the city acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and unnecessarily, and has failed to comply with the provisions of its charter; that the condemnation is a subterfuge and a conspiracy to enable the owners of the adjoining property to obtain necessary connections to utilities installed by the petitioner after having contracted with him to pay $ 7,500 and other consideration for such purposes; that the said property lies without the legal corporate limits, and the city has no power under its charter to acquire or condemn property for street purposes which lies without the corporate limits, and the condemnation is unnecessary since the adjoining property also lies without the corporate limits; and that the provisions of Code (Ann. Supp.) &sect; 69-901 (Ga. L. 1946, p. 130) and the ordinance by which the lands were taken into the city are violative of the Constitution (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-1301).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court did agree with the landowner that the procedure by which the city sought to condemn the landowner' property was void because the law itself was void in that it violated the constitutional inhibition against delegating legislative powers under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-1301. The court held that the matter of fixing municipal corporate limits was strictly legislative, and it was beyond the power of the city's general assembly to delegate its exclusive power to alter the corporate limits of the city. However, the court noted that in 1953 the charter of the city was amended. This amendment ratified all previous incorporations of territory into the city, or attempts to do so and expressly included all such lands within the city. The court noted that no attack was made in the trial court upon the validity of the 1953 charter amendment and therefore, any arguments that it was invalid were to be disregarded and the law accepted as being valid. The court concluded that being a part of the city, the landowner's property was subject to the proper exercise by the mayor and council of charter powers to condemn for street purposes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case is one to enjoin the defendant from practicing dentistry and is brought in two counts, i. e., (1) for illegally practicing dentistry without a license, and (2) for unauthorized practice of dentistry constituting a public nuisance.  The answer of the defendant, as amended, admits that he is not a licensed dentist, but is a dental laboratory technician having his own laboratory, but he alleges that the portion of Code (Ann.) &sect; 84-701 (Ga. L. 1949, pp. 1161, 1162) defining the practice of dentistry as &quot;All persons who shall charge a fee . . . who shall . . . take an impression thereof for the purpose of treating or operating upon the same [human tooth, teeth, gums or jaws], or who shall make or repair appliances usable on teeth or as teeth, unless said appliances are ordered by and returned to a licensed dentist,&quot; is violative of the due-process clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions and is void, since the defendant has the right to carry on his vocation of dental technician, and since under the law the licensed dentists taking impressions and ordering dentures or appliances usable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as teeth send the prescriptions or orders therefor direct to the laboratory or technician of their choice, and the patients for whom such are prescribed do not have the free choice to select a laboratory or technician of their own, and the defendant would not be afforded the opportunity to conduct his business or vocation except upon the whim of licensed dentists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case came on for trial after the defendant was restrained, and it was stipulated: (1) the plaintiffs are licensed dentists, authorized to practice dentistry in this State; and (2) the defendant has prepared impressions for the purpose of making and repairing appliances usable as teeth, and he has made appliances usable as teeth which were not ordered or returned to a licensed dentist, and that he has charged and received a fee for such service.  In addition, the evidence in substance showed the education of the defendant, his practical and theoretical training, and his qualifications as a dental laboratory technician; testimony by expert witnesses as to the science of dentures, the training required of student dentists on this subject, the education and training necessary for students to qualify to take the examination&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Georgia State Board of Dental Examiners for a license to practice dentistry, the importance of centric occlusion or &quot;taking the bite&quot; upon the general health of a person, the importance of the oral examination made by dentists in taking impressions and in fitting appliances to diagnose disease, discover pathological conditions, and prevent rough spots which would cause irritation, the need for correct adjustments to avoid irritation, prevent sore spots, impairment of speech, and change in the facial contours of the patients, especially in women; and that dental laboratory technicians are mere mechanics who know the fundamentals of the materials with which they work, but who confine their work to fabrication of the denture or appliance according to prescription or instructions of the dentist, having nothing whatever to do with the patient, usually never seeing the patient.  The defendant admitted that he had made no oral examination of the patients' mouths, merely asking them if their gums were sore; that he would make an impression, and after making the denture would insert the appliance in their mouths, instructing them to return to the laboratory on a future day for adjustments&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  if the denture did not fit or &quot;bothered&quot; the patient.  Other testimony disclosed that some dentists make the dentures or appliances themselves, but the prescription or order for dentures or appliances is normally sent by the dentist to a dental laboratory or technician, the choice being made by the dentist and not the patient.  The defendant further testified that he had no other way of making a living; that, since the restraining order he has received hardly any orders for dentures, appliances, or repairs from practicing dentists in the area from which he had previously received such orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the evidence was in, counsel for the plaintiffs moved the court to direct the jury to return a verdict for them, and after argument thereon the court sustained the motion and directed a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs.  A motion for new trial was duly made, which was later amended to add one special ground complaining of the direction of the verdict against the defendant, and after a hearing and argument thereon, the motion as amended was denied.  The exception here is to that judgment.  </SPAN></P>

The dentists had filed suit seeking an injunction to prevent the technician from taking impressions and fitting dental prosthetics without supervision of a licensed dentist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The technician argued that the statute requiring the supervision of a licensed dentist for the making of impressions and the creation of dentures therefrom violated constitutional provisions allowing individuals the right to work. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment in favor of the dentists. The court stated that the mere fact that the making and manufacture of these appliances were purely mechanical did not mean that the taking of the impression and the fitting of such prosthetics, as shown by the evidence, did not require the scientific knowledge of the professionally trained medical man in performing this function. The court found that the regulations were not unreasonable. The court held that the operations performed by the technician in taking impressions and fitting dental prosthetics for a fee were clearly acts required to be performed by a licensed dentist, and the mere fact that the legislature held these professional men accountable and responsible for such acts as a part of their profession in no way violated due process when others were only allowed to make or repair the appliances when ordered a licensed dentist.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petition for injunction.  Before Judge Anderson.  Houston Superior Court.  January 31, 1957.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action for an injunction to restrain the collection of State and County ad valorem taxes against the property of the plaintiff for the tax year 1956 and subsequent years, brought against the taxing authorities of Houston County, Georgia, by the International Business Machines Corporation, which has a considerable number of its business machines located on a rental basis at the Robins Air Force Base, a United States government installation, located at Warner Robins, Houston County, Georgia.  The petitioner relies upon Code (Ann.) &sect;&sect; 15-301, 15-302, 15-303, Code &sect; 1-125 (17), and Title 40 U. S. C. A. &sect; 255, that the United States having accepted exclusive jurisdiction granted by the General Assembly of Georgia of approximately 6,600 acres in Houston County in connection with the Air Base, the Houston County taxing authorities are without authority to tax any private property located exclusively on said government installation.  The petition in substance alleges: that the defendants are insisting that said private property is subject to tax, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and that such taxation would be illegal, null, void, and unconstitutional in violation of the statutes and constitutional provisions above set forth, and the petitioner has refused to pay any tax on said machines so located; that the defendants have levied such tax, issued a bill for the collection of same, which the petitioner refuses to pay, and shortly will issue fi. fa. and levy on the petitioner's property being used for vital defense purposes by the United States; that the petitioner has no adequate remedy at law; and it prays that the defendants be temporarily and permanently restrained and enjoined from attempting to collect such tax, the same being illegal, void, and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General demurrers alleged Code (Ann.) &sect;&sect; 15-301, 15-302, and 15-303, upon which the petitioner relies, to be unconstitutional to the extent that (a) they grant an exemption from property taxation in violation of the State Constitution, Code (Ann.) &sect; 2-5404, which specifies the property within the State which may be exempt from property taxation by the General Assembly, and does not include privately owned property such as here; and (b) that said statutes, together or singly, irrevocably alienate, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  give, grant, limit or restrain, or have alienated, given, granted, limited, or restrained, in favor of the United States, the power of taxation of Georgia and its subdivisions, in violation of Code (Ann.) &sect; 2-5401, such that the State of Georgia or its subdivisions are precluded from the exercise of its sovereign right of taxation over the petitioner's privately owned property located in Houston County.  The demurrers were sustained as to (b) above.  The order of the court held that the Code sections violated Code (Ann.) &sect; 2-5401, and that the petitioner failed to show that the proposed taxation of the privately owned property of the petitioner, leased to the Department of Defense, would constitute an unconstitutional or unlawful interference with the operations or activities of the United States.  The exception here by the petitioner is to that judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By brief, counsel for the defendants in error abandoned their ground of demurrer alleging the Code sections involved to be an exemption from property taxation in violation of Code (Ann.) &sect; 2-5404, and asked that the judgment be affirmed on the basis of the attempted waiver of the State's sovereign right of taxation in violation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Constitution, Code (Ann.) &sect; 2-5401, which is the basis of the judgment by the lower court.  </SPAN></P>

The court noted that the legislature could not have surrendered the State sovereignty to tax without express constitutional power, which was not shown. The court noted that any attempt to surrender it was effective only to the extent of allowing the United States to own and use the land free from State interference by taxes or otherwise. Individuals, including the corporation could not have been given such privileges. The United States was immune from property taxes under O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 15-301, 15-302, and 15-303.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Injunction.  Before Judge Clinkscales.  Gwinnett Superior Court.  November 21, 1956.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DeWitt T. Spence and two others, alleging themselves to be residents and taxpayers of the Town of Lilburn, filed a suit in the Superior Court of Gwinnett County against O. B. Rowell, R. P. Pickens, H. C. Peevy, N. J. Nash, Hoyt E. Gresham, and E. W. Bramblett.  The petition alleges: By an act which was approved on July 27, 1910, the legislature incorporated the Town of Lilburn in Gwinnett County and fixed its corporate limits at three-eighths of a mile in every direction from the courthouse in Berkshire Militia District.  The act named a mayor and four councilmen as the governing body of the town and provided for the election of their successors.  In 1933 or 1934, the officers of the town ceased to function as such, and in 1939 the legislature expressly repealed the incorporating act of 1910.  The Town of Lilburn has never had a population of 1,000 inhabitants.  In 1955, the legislature incorporated the City of Lilburn and fixed its corporate limits at one and one-fourth of a mile in every direction from the intersection of Main and Lula&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Streets in the newly incorporated area.  The act included all of the area incorporated in 1910 as the Town of Lilburn and other contiguous territory.  It named the defendants, other than Bramblett, as mayor and councilmen respectively of the city, and provided for the election of their successors in office.  The defendants, other than Bramblett, were re-elected to their respective offices, and pursuant to authority contained in section 11 of the act they, as mayor and councilmen, elected the defendant Bramblett as the city's chief of police.  Neither the repealing act of 1939 nor the incorporating act of 1955 became effective, since no election for that purpose was called and held as required by Code &sect;&sect; 69-101 and 69-102.  The defendants, without any legal right so to do, are performing and exercising over the petitioners and the other residents of the area embraced in the act of 1955 all of the powers conferred upon such officers by the incorporating act of 1955; and to prevent such unauthorized action, the petitioners have no adequate remedy at law.  Besides for process, rule nisi and service, the prayers are: (1) that the defendants be enjoined, temporarily and permanently, from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  performing any of the powers enumerated in the act of 1955 and from exercising any municipal control over the petitioners and the other residents of the area embraced in the act; that the act of 1955 be declared of no force and effect; and that the petitioners be granted such other relief as they may be entitled to under the allegations of their petition and the evidence.  There was no demurrer to the petition; but, by their answer, the defendants averred that the City of Lilburn was legally incorporated by the act of 1955; that they had been elected to and were rightfully holding their respective offices, and that they were exercising no municipal control over the petitioners and the other residents of the city other than that authorized by the act of 1955.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At an interlocutory hearing, the plaintiffs introduced in evidence their verified petition, and the defendants likewise introduced in evidence their verified answer.  It was stipulated that the population of the Town of Lilburn and the City of Lilburn had at all times been far less than 50,000.  The evidence shows, without dispute, that the mayor and councilmen of the Town of Lilburn ceased to function in 1933 or 1934; that no&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  corporate acts were thereafter performed by them or any successors in office; and that no election, as provided for by Code &sect;&sect; 69-101 and 69-102, was called and held for the purpose of determining whether or not the act of 1939 or the act of 1955 should become effective.  The judge refused to grant the temporary injunction prayed for, and the exception is to that judgment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff residents sought review of a judgment by the Superior Court of Gwinnett County (Georgia), which found in favor of defendant public officials and refused to grant the residents a temporary injunction to prevent the public officials from performing their official duties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature incorporated the Town of Lilburn in 1910. The act of 1939 purported to repeal the incorporating act of 1910. The legislature then incorporated the City of Lilburn by the act of 19955. The residents filed a petition alleging that the public officials were unlawfully performing their duties because neither the act of 1939 nor the act of 1955 were valid. The petition alleged that no election for that purpose was called and held as required by O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 69-101, 69-102. The trial judge refused to grant injunctive relief, and the residents sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that &sect;&sect; 69-101, 69-102 did not apply to the repeal of a charter granted to a town having a population of less than 50,000. Further, &sect;&sect; 69-101, 69-102 applied only to cities of less than 50,000 inhabitants and not to incorporated towns having such a population. The court noted that the parties stipulated that the population of the town had at all times been far less than 50,000. Therefore, the court concluded that the act of 1939 legally repealed the act of 1910, and the legislature was entitled to incorporate the City of Lilburn in 1955.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff property owner appealed a judgment from the Hall Superior Court (Georgia) that dismissed the owner's petition for a writ of mandamus against defendants, the City of Gainesville, Georgia, and various officials, to compel the issuance to him of a building permit to construct a church, pursuant to Gainesville, Ga., Ordinance &sect; 61. The trial court sustained defendants' general demurrer to the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner's petition attacked the constitutionality of the Act of 1965, 1965 Ga. Laws 2163, which permitted the City to adopt zoning ordinances, and alleged that the only basis of refusal of the permit was Gainesville, Ga., Ordinance &sect; 61, which permitted the construction of churches in a specific zoning classification. On appeal, the court ruled that the owner's petition did not state a cause of action that warranted mandamus relief. The court noted that the petition did not allege that the owner proposed to build a church that did not comply with the regulations, or that his property was within a district that was zoned to prohibit churches. The ordinance did not deny him the right to build a church, but expressly permitted the building of churches in a particular zone. There being no facts alleged that showed that the owner had been injuriously affected by the ordinance or the Act, he was not in a position to attack as unconstitutional the ordinance or the Act. The owner had, but did not pursue, an adequate legal remedy by appealing the denial of the permit, and thus he was not entitled to a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon plaintiff's propounding 18 interrogatories to have been answered by the president of the corporation, the corporation made a motion to reject them. The trial court granted the motion on the grounds that they were propounded under a chapter of the 1933 Code of the State of Georgia which was unconstitutional because it attempted to penalize corporations for a failure of its officers to answer interrogatories, depriving the corporation of property without due process of law. The trial court also held that plaintiff failed to comply with the laws in regard to interrogatories. The court held that it had no jurisdiction over the appeal because defendants' attack on the constitutionality of the Georgia Code was insufficient. No particular part of the attacked chapter was specifically pointed out by defendants, requiring the court to examine the entire chapter to find an unconstitutional provision. Because defendants failed to make a clear, definite, and specific attack on a portion of the chapter, the court had no jurisdiction over the attack and the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Savannah City Court (Georgia) that convicted him of usury. The trial court overruled defendant's demurrer that the accusation against him violated equal protection guarantees of Ga. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1, para. 25 and U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant charged the victim $ 5 for the use of $ 50 for one week, which amounted to an interest rate of 43 percent per month.

While in the car, the officers seized evidence of other loan transactions, which was introduced at trial after defendant's motion to suppress was denied. On appeal, the court ruled that the accusation against defendant clearly charged an offense under O.C.G.A. &sect; 57-117, and the demurrers that challenged the sufficiency of the accusation were meritless. Defendant's claim that the accusation or &sect; 57-117 were unconstitutional was meritless. Defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied because, inter alia: (1) U.S. Const. amends. IV, V applied only to proceedings in federal courts and had no application to trials in state courts; and (2) the admission in evidence in a state-court trial of articles taken from defendant and car by state officers without a search warrant did not violate Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Alleging a net operating loss and claiming a deduction for federal income taxes for prior fiscal years that were paid in 1952, the taxpayer sought a refund. The taxpayer claimed that under Georgia income tax law, it was entitled to carry back as a deduction for its November 1951 fiscal year its net operating loss for the succeeding year, resulting in a reduction in its income tax for 1951. Based on the addition of O.C.G.A. &sect; 92-32109(m)(3)(F), disallowing income taxes as a deduction in computing a net operating loss for all tax years after February 15, 1952, the taxpayer's petition was denied. On appeal, the taxpayer argued that it had an absolute vested right in the income tax law in effect prior to the amendment to &sect; 92-3109 and that such amendment was void and unconstitutional under Ga. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3, para. 2. In rejecting the taxpayer's arguments, the court held that the taxpayer had no vested right in the state's statutory provision of deductions for payment of federal taxes, as such allowance was a privilege. Further, the repeal of the statutory allowance of such a deduction required the Commissioner to apply the law as it existed when he considered the petition.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in striking from the trustees' response the reasons why the trustees had denied the officer's demand. The court noted that the trustees' response had alleged that the Act of 1925 was repealed by the Act of 1933 and that the pension fund in existence under the 1925 act, at the time of its repeal, had been wholly exhausted. The court also noted that the trustees' response had alleged that the officer was not entitled to payment at a rate of pension as provided under the Act of 1925 out of a fund raised under the Act of 1933.

The trial court denied the taxpayer's protest and certain special demurrers were filed. A new Commissioner succeeded to the office. The original trial judge disqualified himself and another was appointed. The new trial judge directed the verdict for the taxpayer. The court held that it was error to direct a verdict in favor of the taxpayer and reversed the judgment. The superior court had power during the same term at which an order or judgment was rendered, to revoke or vacate it for meritorious cause. Such power was not lost during the term merely because the time for excepting to the judgment directly by writ of error had expired. Further, there being no contention that the judge of the superior court was not disqualified to preside in the case, it was not essential to the validity of the appointment by the clerk of a judge pro hac vice to try the case that an effort should have been made by the judge to procure the services of another judge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second appearance of this case in this court, it having been held in the first appearance ( Bedingfield v. Parkerson, 211 Ga. 386, 86 S. E. 2d 215) that the writ of error was prematurely brought to this court, the petitioners having sought to review as a final judgment the overruling of demurrers to the defendants' answer, which raised certain constitutional questions and attacked as unconstitutional the School Reorganization Act of 1953 (Ga. L. 1953, Nov.-Dec. Sess., p. 282).  The petitioners, who were the plaintiffs in error in the first appearance and are the plaintiffs in error here, brought an equitable petition to enjoin the enforcement of alleged &quot;consolidation&quot; orders and resolutions of the Laurens County Board of Education, in which petition it is alleged that the orders were adopted in 1951, 1952, and 1953, which was before the passage of the act of 1953.  By amendments it is alleged that the board has &quot;grossly abused the discretion vested&quot; therein by consolidation of the schools, disregarding and violating the plain provisions of Code (Ann.) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &sect; 32-915 (Ga. L. 1919, p. 326; 1946, pp. 206, 207), requiring a consolidated school to be located as near the center of the school district or districts as possible; that the high school here proposed to be established and maintained is not the type of high school authorized by Code &sect; 32-933, since it is to be built entirely from State funds furnished by the State School Building Authority, employ teachers to be paid entirely from State funds, and not from funds raised or made possible through local taxation funds; and that it will be a new, distinct, and independent high school or educational unit; and that it is not as a result of the reorganization or fixing of grades to be taught in or at existing schools or educational units.  Demurrers were sustained to these amendments.  The answer of the defendants being, in substance, that they were reorganizing and rearranging the schools of the county in a lawful manner in conformity with a resolution adopted January 28, 1954, under the authority of an act of the General Assembly approved December 18, 1953 (Ga. L. 1953, Nov.-Dec. Sess., p. 282), there was an issue of fact to be decided.  The case proceeded to trial, and after hearing evidence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  -- which was in the main excerpts from the minutes and resolutions of the Laurens County Board of Education for the years 1951, 1952, 1953, and 1954, and the reorganization resolution of January 28, 1954, adopted under the authority of the School Reorganization Act of 1953, whereby the various schools of the county were reorganized and the number of grades fixed at each school in the respective system in accordance with the present plan now under attack -- the court directed a verdict for the defendants and entered judgment and a decree based on said verdict.  A motion for new trial and an amendment thereto were subsequently filed, heard, and overruled, and the exceptions here are to all the adverse rulings of the court against the petitioners.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizens' petition alleged that the board's orders were adopted before passage of the School Reorganization Act of 1953 (Act), 1953 Ga. Laws 282, 283. The citizens' amendments claimed that the board grossly abused its discretion by consolidating the schools, in disregard of and violation of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 32-915. The contested judgment was affirmed. The court found that the board's resolution passed in 1954 was authorized by the Act because the fact that the same reorganization had occurred before passage of the Act did not prevent an adoption of the resolution. The court held that what the 1954 resolution attempted to accomplish was readily within the board's authority conferred by the Act. The court found that the board's answer was not subject to the citizens' demurrers. The court held that the construction of a new building in order to transfer grades fell within the definition of reorganization. The court correctly overruled the citizens' demurrers because none of their constitutional grounds possessed merit. The court decided that the proposed &quot;new school&quot; was a type provided by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 32-933, which was the only method provided by law to create high schools.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petition for injunction.  Before Judge Whitman.  Fulton Superior Court.  March 1, 1956.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Georgia, brought a suit against First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Atlanta, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States, and prayed that it be enjoined from exercising a power of sale contained in a security deed which it executed and delivered to the defendant on May 6, 1953.  In substance and so far as need be stated, the petition as five times amended, alleges: The defendant agreed to make the plaintiff a construction loan not to exceed $ 6,840,000 for the development of a subdivision known as &quot;Drew Valley.&quot; From May 6, 1953, to July 29, 1955, it gave the defendant seven notes aggregating $ 4,329,000, all so connected one with the other as to make a continuous course of dealing.  Its first note was for $ 3,420,000, dated May 6, 1953, due May 6, 1954, with interest at 5% per annum on the average daily balance of advances as calculated by the defendant and payable by the plaintiff monthly.  From the proceeds of this note and on the day it was given, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the defendant charged the plaintiff a service charge of $ 85,500.  On July 9, 1954, the defendant reduced the face amount of this note $ 921,000.  The second note was for $ 79,000 dated January 25, 1954, due May 6, 1954, with interest at 5% per annum on the average daily balance of advances as calculated by the defendant and payable monthly.  No payments were made on this note, and it was canceled by the defendant on July 9, 1954.  The third note was for $ 300,000, dated September 20, 1954, due December 20, 1955, and from the proceeds thereof the defendant charged the plaintiff a service charge of $ 1,500.  The fourth note was for $ 75,000, dated May 6, 1955, due May 6, 1956, and from the proceeds thereof the defendant charged the plaintiff a service charge of $ 375.  The fifth note was for $ 85,000, dated June 14, 1955, due May 6, 1956, and from the proceeds thereof the defendant charged the plaintiff a service charge of $ 425.  The sixth note was for $ 50,000, dated July 29, 1955, due May 6, 1956, and from the proceeds thereof the defendant charged the plaintiff a service charge of $ 250.  The seventh note was for $ 320,000, dated July 29, 1955, due May 6, 1956, and from the proceeds&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  thereof the defendant charged the plaintiff a service charge of $ 1,600.  The last five notes provide for the payment of interest as calculated by the defendant at the rate of 8% per annum on the average daily balance of advances, and payable monthly.  The service charge of $ 89,650 was in addition to the amounts paid by the plaintiff for its loan application, for an appraisal of its property, a survey of it, record of the loan deed, inspection of the property, insurance on the property, fees of $ 21,300 paid to the defendant's attorney for his examination of the plaintiff's title and preparation of instruments incident to the loan, and a charge of $ 10 for each check the defendant wrote in disbursement of the loan.  The service charge on the first note was reduced $ 25,000 by the defendant on July 9, 1954, by a credit of that amount on the plaintiff's loan account.  On July 13, 1954, the plaintiff's account was also credited with $ 4,605 as a refund on fees paid to the defendant's attorney.  For the so-called &quot;service charge&quot; the defendant was to render and rendered no service to the plaintiff, and such charge was only a device and contrivance on the defendant's part to charge usury&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the loan.  On December 20, 1954, the interest rate on the plaintiff's note for $ 3,420,000 was, pursuant to provisions therefor contained in the note and the loan deed, changed from 5% to 8% per annum, and thereafter interest was calculated on it by the defendant and paid by the plaintiff monthly at the rate of 8% per annum on the average daily balance of advances made.  The total amount which the defendant advanced to the plaintiff on the seven notes was $ 3,018,847.68 or $ 1,310,152.32 less than the face amount of them, and the plaintiff never understood why he was required to give the last six notes.  The highest daily balance of advances which the plaintiff had at any one time was $ 1,549,642.68.  On the amount so advanced, the defendant calculated and charged to the plaintiff's loan account the sum of $ 140,848.33 as interest.  This amount when added to the so-called &quot;service charge&quot; of $ 63,050, which is disguised interest, makes the amount which the defendant charged the plaintiff for the use of its money $ 203,898.33 or interest at the rate of 9.29% per annum.  During August, after its note for $ 320,000 was given on July 29, 1955, while the defendant was actively proceeding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with the construction of its subdivision and when several of its houses were unfinished, the defendant notified the plaintiff that no further advances would be made on the notes, and thereafter wrongfully refused to advance any further amount.  Of the $ 3,018,847.68 which the defendant advanced the plaintiff on the seven notes, the plaintiff has from February 8, 1954, to October 3, 1955, repaid on principal advanced $ 2,336,955 leaving a balance due on principal of $ 681,892.68.  By monthly payments beginning June 5, 1953, and ending July 29, 1955, the plaintiff paid the defendant $ 123,770.10 as interest, and this amount together with the so-called &quot;service charge&quot; of $ 63,050, which is in fact disguised interest taken by the defendant, should, because of the defendant's usurious charge for the use of its money, be credited on the principal amount advanced the plaintiff; and with these amounts ($ 186,820.10) so credited, as they should be, the plaintiff is due the defendant only $ 495,072.58.  On October 6, 1955, the defendant started a foreclosure sale of the property conveyed by the loan deed.  On October 27, 1955, the plaintiff made an actual unconditional tender to the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of $ 495,072.58 -- the full amount it was then due the defendant with all interest including service charges as disguised interest forfeited.  The tender was refused.  The amended petition was demurred to generally on the ground that it failed to state a cause of action either at law or in equity and specially on several grounds.  The general demurrer was overruled, but the grounds of special demurrer were not passed on.  The defendant excepted.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The creditor was a savings and loan association that provided a construction loan to the debtor and charged a $ 63,050 service charge for the loan application. The debtor argued that the service charge was a device and contrivance to charge usury on the loan. The court held that the judgment complained of was not erroneous. The court first determined that as a federal savings and loan association doing business in the State of Georgia, the creditor was subject to the operation of and was required to comply with the State's usury laws and with those of 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1425 in making loans. The court also determined that the allegations in the debtor's petition were sufficient to show that no service was in fact rendered by the creditor to the debtor in exchange for the service charge. The court accordingly reasoned that the so-called service charge was taken by the creditor only for the use of the debtor's money and was therefore a device and contrivance on the creditor's part to exact usury. The court concluded that the debtor was entitled to an injunction to prevent a sale of his property because he had made a valid continuing tender of the amount due under the loan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised a special ground for the motion for a new trial in which he excepted to the charge of the trial court on his statement, upon the ground that he made no statement not under oath. The court rejected the claim as meritless, noting that while a defendant was prohibited under the law from making a statement under oath and it appeared that he was first sworn as a witness and then made what appeared in the record a &quot;statement,&quot; the record did not show that the law was violated in this respect. The court then ruled that reversal was warranted because the State failed to prove venue, proof of which was part of the State's case, under Ga. Const. art. 6, &sect; 14, para. 6, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-4906, and the court's precedent. The court ruled that 1911 Ga. Laws 149, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 6-1609, which prohibited court's from reversing convictions for lack of proof of venue or of the time of the commission of the offense, except where the issue had been raised specifically by a ground of a motion for a new trial, was an unconstitutional invasion by the legislature into the judiciary's function. Section 6-1609 was not binding upon the court, the court ruled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Land registration.  Before Judge Moore.  Fulton Superior Court.  January 26, 1956.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Realty &amp; Finance Corporation and C. J. Camp brought their petition to register title to certain described land.  They set out their chain of title under which they claimed the land, which was, in so far as is material here, a tax deed to a remote grantor, which was executed on October 5, 1943, under an execution and sale in the name of Mrs. Lillian Worsham against the property as the property of Mrs. Lillian Worsham, to satisfy the claim of the City of Atlanta for municipal taxes for the year 1936.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 9, 1954, M. L. Patterson filed his plea and answer to the petition for registration and set up his claim to the land in question.  The claim of M. L. Patterson was based upon a tax deed executed to the City of Atlanta on August 5, 1947, under an execution and sale in the name of Mrs. Lillian Worsham against the property as the property of Mrs. Lillian Worsham, to satisfy the claim of the City of Atlanta for municipal taxes for the years 1940-1946; a quitclaim deed from the Mayor of the City of Atlanta to M. L. Patterson, dated December 8, 1948; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a quitclaim deed from Mrs. Lillian Worsham to M. L. Patterson dated August 26, 1954; and a so-called Resolution of Ratification dated September 22, 1954, by the Mayor and Council of the City of Atlanta confirming the quitclaim deed executed in 1948, above referred to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the hearing, during which the only evidence submitted was the documentary evidence, the petitioners contended that they had good title to the property by virtue of their deeds under the act of the General Assembly enacted in 1949 (Ga. L. 1949, p. 1132 et seq.; Code, Ann. Supp., &sect;&sect; 92-8315 and 92-8316), which reads in part as follows: &quot;Nothing contained in sections 92-8301, 92-8306 to 92-8314, inclusive, shall prevent a title under a tax deed from ripening by prescription after a period of seven years from the date of the execution of the tax deed.  Any tax deed regularly executed at a valid and legal sale held by the State or any subdivision thereof, including counties and municipalities, when the defendant in fi. fa. is sui juris, shall after the expiration of seven years from the date of said tax deed convey fee simple title and title to the property described in said tax deed shall vest absolutely in the grantee&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  therein or his heirs or assigns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant contended that the petitioners had no interest in the land because the sale for 1940-1946 taxes in 1947, which was subsequent to the execution of the tax deed to petitioners' remote grantor, divested them of their interest, and that the defendant by virtue of the deeds from the City of Atlanta and Mrs. Lillian Worsham was entitled to have the land registered in his name.  There was no evidence that either party had ever been in possession of the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the completion of the hearing, the examiner found that the petitioners had good title to the land and were entitled to have title registered as prayed.  The defendant filed his exceptions to the report of the examiner, which were duly overruled by the superior court.  The exception here is to that judgment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners received title to the property in 1943 from a remote grantor, who held a tax deed for the property. Respondent claimed to have received title to the land from the city in 1948 and from the former owner in 1954. Petitioners contended that they had good title under the Act of 1949, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 92-8315-6, which provided that a tax deed ripened by prescription after seven years. Respondent argued that the city's tax sale of the property in 1947 divested them of their interest. Respondent filed an answer to the petition in 1954. On appeal from a judgment in favor of petitioners, the court affirmed, finding that the city had no interest in the property at the time it executed the deed to respondent and that petitioners interest had vested. The court found that the city had no right to sell the property under a tax execution because the former owner, against whom it was levied had no title or possession. The sale was void as to the true owners, petitioners, and petitioners were not divested in their interest by the city's attempted tax sale. The court found that respondent had no interest in the property because neither the city or the former owner had title to pass.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff filed an action against her former husband to modify an alimony decree.  It was alleged that, in May, 1942, a final verdict and decree were entered in the superior court, wherein the defendant was required to pay $ 10 per month for the support of each child of the parties until 18 years of age, and that two of the children for whom such allowance was made are now 16 and 14 years of age, respectively.  At the time the original decree was entered, the defendant owned property of an approximate value of $ 6,500.  At the time of the filing of the application to modify, the defendant is worth approximately $ 200,000.  The plaintiff prayed for process and for revision of the alimony decree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant demurred to the petition on the ground that it failed to set forth a cause of action against him, and on the further ground that the act approved March 9, 1955, entitled, &quot;Modification of Permanent Alimony Judgments,&quot; (Ga.

The act of 1953 provided that that a person who commits a felony after having been three times convicted must upon conviction of the fourth offense, server the maximum time provided in the sentence and was not eligible for parole until the maximum had been served. The court held that the act of 1953 did not in any wise affect the question of the guilt or innocence of defendant that was under review. The court held that only in the event that conviction was upheld, and when the time arrived when he might claim the right to a parole and the act was asserted as a bar to such alleged right, could defendant claim the right to attack the validity of the act.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J. Sidney Lanier and E. B. Lanier filed in Fulton Superior Court, against T. E. Suttles, Tax Collector, and the Joint Board of City and County Tax Assessors, a petition, which as amended alleged substantially the following: The petitioners are the owners of designated lots in the cities of East Point, Hapeville, and Atlanta.  The over-all increase in assessments made by the Joint Board of City and County Tax Assessors over the amounts assessed by the Tax Assessors of the City of East Point, is $ 2,720.  Neither the Joint Board of City and County Tax Assessors, nor any member thereof, has been by, on, through, in, or near any of the properties herein named for appraisal for tax purposes, nor was any notice of change in tax assessments for said properties given petitioners, as required by law.  Since no incorporated city in Fulton County is represented on the Joint Board of City and County Tax Assessors, with the exception of the City of Atlanta, said board is unconstitutional, and tax assessments by said board are inequitable, unfair, and unjust; the cities have duly appointed or legally elected&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tax assessors of their own, and assessments made by such assessors are binding on all parties, including Fulton County; the assessments of taxes by two different agencies on the same realty in different amounts, without representation, is illegal, unconstitutional, unfair, and unjust to the property owner, and amounts to taxation without representation.  Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law, for the reason that the Fulton County Board of Appeals is unconstitutional for the same reason that the Joint Board of City and County Tax Assessors is unconstitutional, having been created by the same act of the legislature.  The petitioners prayed: that process and a rule nisi issue; that the tax collector be enjoined from collecting taxes from the petitioners, on any assessments made by the Joint Board of City and County Tax Assessors, in excess of the taxes on assesments made by the Tax Assessors of the City of East Point; that the Joint Board of City and County Tax Assessors be enjoined from making any tax assessments on the petitioners' property without representation on said board from the incorporated cities in which the petitioners' properties are located.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers sought an injunction from the trial court on the basis that the Board and the Fulton County Board of Appeals was unconstitutional. The court determined that defendants' demurrer was properly sustained. First, the allegations in the taxpayers' petition did not state what provisions of the Georgia or United States Constitution were alleged to be violated. Additionally, an injunction could not have been properly issued because the only reason given by the taxpayers for their not having an adequate remedy at law was that the County Board of Appeals was unconstitutional. As no constitutional question was properly raised, the allegation as to no adequate remedy at law failed, because where all the relief sought by a party could be obtained in a manner provided by law, a suit in equity for injunction was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs appealed from a decree of the Cobb Superior Court (Georgia) that denied their prayer for a permanent injunction after a nonjury trial in plaintiffs' action challenging the zoning of defendant landowners' property for cemetery purposes by the Cobb County Planning Commission pursuant to 1943 Ga. Laws 892 as amended in 1949 (1943 act). The landowners cross-appealed from some of the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs alleged that the 1943 act, which established the commission and empowered it to enact zoning laws, violated the Georgia Constitution, and that the landowners' property was limited to residential and agricultural uses by a 1939 zoning ordinance. The court affirmed the judgment and dismissed the cross-appeal. The court held that, by delegating the authority to enact zoning and planning laws to the commission, the 1943 act violated Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; 7, para. 23 (1945), Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-1923. The county commissioner of roads and revenues, not the commission, was the county's governing authority with the authority to enact zoning laws. The court determined, however, that the 1939 ordinance was arbitrary and capricious as applied to the disputed property. An air base, an airplane factory, and several commercial enterprises had been built nearby, and an easement had been created over part of the property that limited the height of trees and structures to the glide angle plane of airplanes landing and taking off. The property was therefore unsuitable for residential or agricultural use and the ordinance was unreasonable as applied to the landowners' property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decree that denied plaintiffs' prayer for a permanent injunction against the zoning of the landowners' property for cemetery purposes and dismissed the land-owners' cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

Prior to the creation of the subdivision, and during its development, the petitioner has served the subdivision with electrical energy.

(9) There is an ordinance appearing on the ordinance book of the city, which appears to have been read the first and second times on January 4, 1955, and the third time on January 18, 1955, a copy being attached and marked Exhibit &quot;A.&quot; (10) Blocks 6, 7, and 8 in the subdivision are not within the corporate limits of the City of Moultrie, but if in such area, the petitioner would be entitled to continue furnishing electrical energy to its customers.  (11) The ordinance referred to in paragraph 9 is unconstitutional and void as being discriminatory against the petitioner, and as having been passed for economic reasons in order to give a monopoly to the city in the distribution of electric energy, in violation of the Constitution of the State of Georgia, art. I, sec. I, pars. II and III, and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.  (12) The petitioner built its distribution lines under a grant of right by the owner of the property, and became vested with a license&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to maintain its lines, and the efforts of the defendants to interfere with its right are in violation of contractual rights, and the ordinance is in violation of contractual rights, and the ordinance is an attempt to impair the rights of contract in violation of the Federal Constitution.  (14) Further action and threats by the defendants will destroy the petitioner's business in the three blocks.  The city is running lines preparatory to servicing houses under construction, and at the same time prevent the petitioner from running its lines and installing its service therein.  (15) The actions and threats of the city's agents, officers, and servants constitute a deliberate and arbitrary invasion of the territory served with electrical energy by the petitioner, which is destructive of the petitioner's business.  (16) Unless the defendants are enjoined and restrained from interfering with the petitioner in the lawful conduct of its business, it will sustain irreparable injury.  (17) The petitioner has no adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayers were for process; that the city's agents, servants, and employees be permanently enjoined and restrained from arresting, harassing, or interfering&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with the petitioner and its agents in the maintenance of service to customers in blocks 6, 7, and 8 of section 2; that the defendants be temporarily enjoined; that the ordinance be decreed null and void, in violation of the provisions of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and of the United States; and for other relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 18, 1955, the judge of the superior court passed an order for service of process; that the defendants show cause why they should not be enjoined as prayed; and until the further order of the court, the defendants were enjoined and restrained as prayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants filed an answer, in which they admitted the allegations of paragraphs 1, 2, 8, and 9, and denied the allegations of paragraphs 5, 10, 11, 12, 16, and 17.  In answer to paragraph 3, the defendants alleged that the petitioner is a corporation organized under the Electric Membership Corporation Act, approved March 30, 1937, and that it has been engaged in business since about the year 1937.  In answer to paragraph 4, the defendants admitted that about 1947 a residential subdivision known as East Moultrie Heights was created, and that during the development of the subdivision the petitioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  served, not the entire area, but a portion thereof, with electrical energy and continues to serve this area.  In answer to paragraph 6, the defendants alleged: On August 17, 1954, the owner of blocks 6, 7, and 8 made application to the city for the annexation of the territory.  The defendants do not know when the petitioner began to run service lines, but deny that the petitioner is serving, or has served, any houses in either of the blocks by permanent lines connected to and running into the houses.  In answer to paragraph 7, the defendants alleged: On November 3, 1954, H. S. Glenn, manager of the petitioner's business, was advised that the city had annexed the territory, that it expected to serve electric current to the residents of the area, and that the city would purchase the petitioner's lines so that it would stand no loss on account of such service.  The petitioner declined to sell its lines at any price, and advised the defendants that it was going to try to serve the territory in all events.  In further answer to paragraph 8, it was alleged that the employees of the petitioner were violating the ordinance of the city, and that the city manager was performing his duties in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ordering their arrest.  In answer to paragraph 13, the defendants denied that the city manager and police officers of the city in the enforcement of the ordinance were arbitrary, unreasonable, or discriminatory.  The only arrests made were on February 14, 1955, but it was the purpose of the defendants to arrest agents, employees, or representatives of the petitioner, or anyone else, violating the ordinance.  The defendants admitted the allegations of paragraph 14, except that the petitioner is serving any of the houses in either of the three blocks.  They alleged that, at the time of the filing of the petition, the city had permanent service lines in all of the completed houses in these blocks.  The defendants denied the allegations of paragraph 15, except that the defendants contend that the petitioner has no right to sell electrical current in the city without a franchise, which it does not have.  Further answering the petition, the defendants alleged: On August 17, 1954, the owner of a part of East Moultrie Heights appeared before the mayor and council of the city and requested orally and in writing that portions of the subdivision be annexed to the city, representing that the development&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the area depended on the owner's ability to get city services.  On the same date the mayor and council put an ordinance upon its first and second reading for the purpose of annexing the territory, and at that time the petitioner was serving no customers in the area sought to be annexed.  After due consideration, the mayor and council passed the ordinance annexing the territory to the city on November 2, 1954, and began the installation of its water, sewer, and electric services.  The petitioner had run a distribution line into the area for the purpose of serving the contractor in the construction of the houses, and the city offered to buy the line from the petitioner.  The city owns its electrical and water distribution system, and desires to furnish these services to its inhabitants.  It is entitled to furnish electricity to its inhabitants without interference from the petitioner, which has no franchise to do business in the city, and is limited by its charter to service to members in rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the hearing for interlocutory injunction, the sole testimony introduced was that of H. S. Glenn, manager of the petitioner, who testified: that the corporation was organized under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Rural Electric Membership Act, and the first lines were run in 1937 in Colquitt County; since 1947 the petitioner has been serving rural areas east of the City of Moultrie and east of Pilco Creek, in a section known as East Moultrie Heights Subdivision; the petitioner had been serving customers with both construction and permanent service; the original lines were built in 1951; and the lines built in 1951 were extended on October 26 and 27, 1954.  With reference to the lines in blocks 6, 7, and 8, the witness testified on direct examination in part as follows: &quot;On October 26 and 27 we built a line into this territory, blocks 6, 7 and 8, -- I believe 7 and 8 already had the line, -- only the 6th, -- and after we had built the line into this territory ready to serve the contractor for temporary service to build the houses at the request of the property owner, we received a telephone call from the city manager about November 1 -- I don't know the exact date, -- and he stated that the territory was being annexed by the city and they planned to build lines in there and would like for us to remove our lines.  . . . Later we were requested again to move the lines and the city would pay&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  us for the lines, that is putting the lines up and taking them down, and as our transformers are different volts from the city they wouldn't have any use for the transformers, so they agreed to pay for the lines, putting them up and taking them down.  This conversation, I believe, happened on November 15.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness further testified on direct examination: &quot;Q. About the time this suit was filed, what service were you running to customers in blocks 7 and 8, Mr. Glenn?  A. We were running permanent service, what we call the service from the pole to the house, service line, extending them from the temporary pole to the house, where we had been serving temporary service while building the house, and from around November 10, some of them, we were extending these services to the house.  . . . Q. I hand you five sheets of paper which I will ask you to identify.  . . . A. It's our regular form of application.  . . . Q. By whom were they made?  A. They were made by Mr. Nijem on November 10.  Q. Are you familiar with dates on which made? A. Made two on November 10, one on 12th, one the 16th, one on November 22.  . . . Q. Do you have applications from others for permanent service on any of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  these lots?  A. We have four applications from people that are planning on buying the houses, have contracted for the houses, to extend permanent service to them.  . . . Q. What are the dates on those applications?  A. These were made on the 17th of February, 1955.  Q. Are these on the same lots that Mr. Nijem made application?  A. That's right, four of the original houses.  Q. . . . Do you know whether or not the city has run any distribution lines and service to any houses in this area in blocks 6, 7, and 8?  A. Yes, it has, they have run after they stopped us a couple of weeks ago.  Q. Do you know whether or not they have installed any service to dwellings there?  A. Yes, sir, they have.  Q. Are those the same dwellings on which you had applications for service for construction?  A. Yes, sir, the same houses.  . . . Q. In order to clarify the identify [identity?] of blocks, 6, 7, and 8, will you state whether or not those particular blocks are in East Moultrie Heights subdivision?  A. They are.  Q. And they are in the general area in which you have been serving for several years?  A. Yes, sir, they are.  Q. . . . What is the reason that your 600 yards of distribution line in blocks&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  7 and 8 was only run very recently?  A. Application was made by the property owner, I said October 23, but it was Saturday I believe, and we were told the contractor was starting Monday morning building so many houses in 7 and 8.  Q. Were there any houses in the area prior to that time?  A. There wasn't any houses in any of those blocks and we went down on his request, which was the 26th and 27th, . . . and run our line and prepared him to take off temporary service on any block that he wanted to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is attached to the brief of evidence a plat of section 2 of East Moultrie Heights Subdivision, and two copies of applications for service to the petitioner, signed by Fred Nijem, dated November 10, 1954, one signed on November 12, one on November 16, and one on November 22; there were four signed on February 17, 1955, by D. B. Freeman, John A. Freeman, Vera Taylor, and C. E. Marshall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross-examination, the witness Glenn testified in part as follows: &quot;Q. I believe these last four applications which were for permanent service were gotten since this litigation arose? A. Yes, sir.  Q. . . . At the time this litigation arose you were not furnishing anybody with permanent service&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in these blocks 6, 7 and 8?  A. That's right.  We were furnishing the contractor service to build the houses with, which I call temporary service.  . . . Q. You knew at the time you ran any service for consumption in blocks 6, 7 and 8 that that property had already been taken into the city, annexed to the city?  A. I was told by the city manager.  I didn't know.  Q. You had that information?  A. Well the city manager told me.  . . . Q. Back in October, when you first ran your line there in blocks 6, 7 and 8, did you know at that time that the city had begun proceedings to annex this territory? A. We did not, we built the lines, the lines were installed and the men were gone when I heard from the city manager that the territory was going to be taken into the city then.  The first call I had from the city manager was that the property would be taken in tomorrow night, that was on Monday, and the lines were installed at that time.  Q. What Monday? A. It must have been the second -- I mean the 1st of November.  Q. You hadn't seen any news item in the paper prior to that time?  A. Yes, I saw the intentions of the city of taking it into the city limits.  Q. You had seen that back in August? &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A. I don't know about August, but I remember reading it.  Q. Some time prior to the time Dr. Bean spoke to you about any service in this area?  A. Yes sir.  Q. And I believe you say that these applications signed by Mr. Nijem were taken by you and were acted on by you after your conversation with the city manager in which he told you that they were going to annex it into the city, is that correct?  A. That's right.  I believe the nearest one of those is November 10th, the earliest.  Q. And these applications were purely for temporary service?  A. Construction purposes, yes sir.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After testifying as to negotiations with the city in regard to selling the petitioner's lines in the disputed area, and that a line running into block 5 &quot;was simply a high line getting into that area,&quot; the witness testified further: &quot;Q. Before this litigation arose you had not put any permanent service in any residence in this area, had you?  A. No sir, we hadn't.  We were in process of doing it when we were stopped.  Q. But you had actually not put any permanent service in any houses in blocks 6, 7 and 8?  A. No sir.  . . . Q. The city did go in there and put permanent service to the houses which had been&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  completed, did it not?  A. After he arrested us, yes sir.  Q. After he stopped you?  A. Yes sir.  Q. Then the city went in there and put permanent service to those houses?  A. Yes sir.  Q. And after you got an injunction against the city and before the order was changed maintaining the status quo, you went in and took the city's permanent installations off of some of these houses?  A. No sir, that's not true.  We run some lines, service lines from our poles to these houses.  Q. How many?  A. Four or five of them.  Q. Did you disconnect the city? A. We disconnected their wires from the entrance cables which is one connector and connected ours on the applications we had for service.  Q. Which you obtained after this litigation arose?  A. That's right.  Q. Now, wait a minute: what day did you do that connection?  A. It was on Friday afternoon, on the 18th of February.  Q. You filed this litigation on the morning of the 18th, didn't you?  A. Yes sir.  Q. And your board has never acted on these applications yet, has it? A. No, they haven't passed them in a board meeting, no sir.  Q. Did you get these applications on the 17th?  A. Yes sir.  Q. After you had brought this suit?  A. The judge&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  signed it on the morning of the 18th.  We can't wait until the board meets to run a service line, that is when a man asks for service, it might be 30 days you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city excepted to the judgment granting an interlocutory injunction, and authorizing the petitioner to serve residents in blocks 6, 7, and 8 of section 2.</SPAN></P>

The Electric Membership Corporation Act of 1937, 1937 Ga.

The city's charter, 1937 Ga. Laws 1990, 1943 Ga. Laws 1458-1499, authorized the city to furnish electricity. The company was not allowed to legally extend its electric lines in the corporate limits of the city under the Act; therefore, injunctive relief was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff injured party appealed from the decision of the Glynn Superior Court (Georgia), which sustained the demurrers filed by defendants, Charlton County, Georgia State Highway Department, and construction company, and dismissed the action filed by the injured party for injuries sustained when her car went out of control because of an abrupt depression in the road.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured party went out of control after hitting an abrupt depression in the road. She filed the action against the County and the construction company. The highway department joined the County's answer. The trial court dismissed her action. On appeal, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court found the injured party's bill of exceptions was properly amended under Ga. Code &sect; 6-913 because, although the construction company was not originally listed as a defendant in error, it was properly served under &sect; 6-912. The court found that the trial court erred by refusing to strike the highway department from the County's pleadings and by refusing to strike their plea to the jurisdiction. The court found that the highway department had to defend the County in the action but that it was not subject to being made a party and so could not defend in its own name. The court found that the trial court properly sustained the construction company's demurrers because it had not breached any duty. The court directed the trial court to dismiss the action against the county for lack of jurisdiction because without the construction company there was no diversity jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The court ordered the trial court to enter an order dismissing the action against the county for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case is here excepting to a declaratory judgment entered by the Superior Court of Fulton County, declaring constitutional and valid the Georgia Rural Roads Authority Act (Ga. L. 1955, p. 124), and the actions taken and proposed to be taken thereunder, as described in the plaintiffs' petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This act created as a body corporate and politic the Georgia Rural Roads Authority, declaring it to be an instrumentality of the State.  Besides the usual corporate powers, the Authority was granted the right to construct rural roads with the proceeds of bonds to be issued by the Authority, and such roads to be rented or leased to the State and the State Highway Department, as lessees, and the rental received by the Authority is to be used to retire the bonds issued by the Authority.  The act authorizes the execution of leases between the Authority as lessor, and the State and the State Highway Board as lessees, covering the projects or roads to be used by the State and the State Highway Board.  The Governor and the State Highway Board are authorized to execute these leases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The act further empowers the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Governor and the governing authority of each county to convey to the Authority for a nominal consideration real property or rights-of-way belonging to the State or county on which the projects shall be constructed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to section 7 of the act, the State Highway Board has by resolution initiated the construction of rural road projects in approximately 130 counties of the State by making a recommendation to the authority to undertake and to finance construction thereof, one of which is in Fayette County.  The Authority has considered this request, and has by resolution provided for the undertaking, construction, and financing of these projects in accordance with the recommendations of the State Highway Board, these resolutions calling upon the Governor and the governing authorities of the several counties involved to convey to the Authority the rights-of-way necessary for the projects.  The estimated cost of construction of these projects will be approximately $ 10,000,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition alleges that the aforesaid resolutions of the State Highway Board and the Authority authorized the execution of a lease of the projects embodying in substance the following terms: For a term not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in excess of fifty years at a rental calculated to enable the Authority to pay the principal of and interest on bonds issued to defray the cost of the projects, to comply with sinking-fund requirements of a trust indenture securing the bonds, to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing, and operating the projects, to perform fully all provisions of any trust indentures securing the bonds, to pay the pro rata share of administrative and operating expenses of the Authority, including sums which may be owed to the Highway Department for plans and specifications, and to pay any expenses in connection with the issuance of the bonds, but with the rental not to exceed under this and any other leases the maximum set forth in the amendment to the Highway Board Act (Ga. L. 1955, p. 249) of $ 8,500,000 per annum, the lease to provide that the Highway Department and/or the county in which the project is situated, shall maintain and keep in good repair the road projects and shall indemnify and save harmless the Authority from damage to person or property occurring on the leased premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsection (d) of section 10 of the act provides that, if the lease obligates the State and State Highway Department, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the lessees, to maintain, repair, and reconstruct the projects during the period of the lease, this work shall be performed by the State Highway Department, but that as to any project which is not a part of the State-aid System of Highways, the duty of maintenance and repair of the project shall rest upon the county in which all or any portion of a project is situated, the same as in the case of other public roads in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs in error, the State of Georgia, the Governor of Georgia, the State Highway Department of Georgia, the State Highway Board of Georgia, and named individual members thereof, and Fayette County, alleging that they are under the duty of administering and carrying out the Rural Roads Authority Act, if the same is valid and constitutional, brought the present suit, alleging uncertainty and the unconstitutionality of the act in the various respects set out in the petition.  The Georgia Rural Roads Authority, in its answer, denied the allegations of unconstitutionality and illegality, and asked for a declaration as to the validity of the act.  The Judge of Fulton Superior Court entered a judgment in favor of the defendant, declaring the act and all&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  actions taken and proposed to be taken to be constitutional and valid in all respects, and the case is here on appeal from that judgment.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner citizen filed a bill of exceptions to the judgment of the Superior Court of Clayton County (Georgia), which sustained the demurrer of defendant elected commissioners to the citizen's petition for a writ of quo warranto that sought to oust the commissioners from their elected positions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizen filed his petition for quo warranto on the ground that the Act of 1955, which created the commissioners' positions, was unconstitutional and void. Specifically the citizen alleged that the Act was unconstitutional because it abolished one office contrary to Ga. Const. of 1945, art. 3, &sect; 7 and because it denied to citizens residing in a certain district the right to become candidates and elected as members of the newly established board of commissioners. Upon the trial court's order of dismissal of the action, the citizen sought review. On appeal, the court held that the repeal of the office of a sole commissioner that allowed for the installment of a three-member board of commissioners was not to be construed as repealing the former act, but as a continuation of the same. The court held that the citizen's contention that the Act denied certain citizens the right to become candidates and elected members of the new board failed to point out the particular provision of what constitution was violated. The court also held that this contention was too indefinite to raise any question for the decision on the constitutionality of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States Casualty Company sued Mrs. Elmo W. Watkins, Thomas L. Peace and Mark A. Smith, individually and as partners doing business as Peace &amp; Smith, and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company seeking to enjoin a settlement of a suit and claim arising out of an alleged tortious act committed upon Elmo W. Watkins, deceased, husband of Mrs. Elmo W. Watkins, by agents of Peace &amp; Smith.  It was alleged in the petition that Elmo W. Watkins was killed while employed by Owens Plumbing &amp; Heating Company; that at the time the death occurred, petitioner was the compensation insurance carrier for Owens Plumbing &amp; Heating Company, and as such paid to the defendant Mrs. Elmo W. Watkins the sum of $ 5,778.60 as compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act of the State of Georgia; that Mrs. Elmo W. Watkins has filed in the Superior Court of DeKalb County a suit against Peace &amp; Smith seeking to recover damages for the death of her husband; that under the Workmen's Compensation Act of Georgia petitioner is entitled to subrogation rights under circumstances whereby legal liability against Peace &amp; Smith is fixed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and determined; that defendant Liberty Mutual Insurance Company was the liability insurance carrier for Peace &amp; Smith at the time the death occurred; that attorneys for Mrs. Elmo W. Watkins and for Peace &amp; Smith and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company are negotiating for a settlement of the liability of defendants in the suit in DeKalb County to plaintiff therein; that if they are allowed to settle, the legal liability of Peace &amp; Smith can never be determined in order to protect petitioner's subrogation rights; that defendant Mrs. Elmo W. Watkins is financially unable to respond to any subrogation judgment which petitioner might obtain against her in the event she makes settlement with the other defendants, and the legal liability of Peace &amp; Smith can not be fixed and determined, and the subrogation rights of petitioner will be rendered futile and without value.  The prayers of the petition were that defendants be enjoined from making any settlement of the action in DeKalb Superior Court above referred to, or any action arising out of the death of Elmo W. Watkins, and that plaintiff's subrogation rights be protected and that petitioner have general relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants demurred generally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the petition.  Plaintiff then amended its petition and alleged that Mrs. Elmo W. Watkins was insolvent.  They also amended the prayers and prayed that any fund resulting from any settlement between defendants be impounded in court and that a receiver be appointed until the legal liability of Peace &amp; Smith and their liability insurance carrier can be determined.</SPAN></P>

The insurer had already paid a sum of money to the widow as compensation for her husband's death. Thereafter, the widow filed an action against the tortfeasors for damages. The parties entered into settlement negotiations and the insurer attempted to halt the negotiations because it did not want its right to subrogation to be compromised. The court affirmed the dismissal. The court held that neither the employer nor his insurance carrier had any right to interfere with a voluntary settlement between an employee and a third party tortfeasor. The court held that if a settlement were enjoined, it would not only discourage, but would prohibit entirely a compromise and settlement. Therefore, the insurer was not entitled to enjoin a voluntary settlement.</SPAN></P>

The residents also challenged statutes and amendments to the city's charter that enabled the city to use water funds to finance the city's hospital. In affirming the judgment that sustained the city's demurrer to the residents' petition, the court ruled that: (1) the residents were not in any position to assert the invalidity of the statutes and charter amendments, in that the amounts that the residents paid for the water did not constitute taxes and thus they did not occupy the status of taxpayers of the city, and, having no interest in the revenues derived from the sale of water, were not affected when the city used its surplus funds for other purposes than operating its water department; and (2) the different rates prescribed for those living within and without of the city did not violate the Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Injunction.  Before Judge Atkinson.  Bibb Superior Court.  December 15, 1954.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buford S. Birdsey and 23 other named persons filed a petition against Wesleyan College, seeking to enjoin the defendant, temporarily and permanently, from erecting commercial buildings upon a part of its described property, from conducting any commercial or business venture on the property described, and from devoting its property to any use other than for school, church, or residence purposes.  In substance the petition alleged: The defendant, by and through its officers and board of trustees, is about to erect, or cause to be erected, buildings and other structures for commercial purposes on a part of its property, containing approximately 100,000 square feet.  The defendant has had an architect make a tentative sketch of proposed business establishments, consisting of a filling station, a drugstore, a variety store, and a general grocery store, and will cause to be conducted therein commercial enterprises and businesses, unless restrained and enjoined.  The construction of such establishments will be contrary to valid zoning ordinances, and will be illegal and unlawful. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The operation of such commercial establishments will greatly devaluate the property of the plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs have a community of interests, being home owners and residents of the area, and bring their action for the benefit of themselves and others similarly situated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant filed an answer, in which it admitted that certain ordinances attached as exhibits to the petition had been adopted by the City of Macon.  It alleged that the original zoning of the area was not the result of a single ordinance or a series of ordinances, but was the result of a number of ordinances at different times, dealing with separate areas.  The defendant admitted that plans were being formulated for the improvement of a part of its property.  It denied that the construction of the buildings would be contrary to any existing zoning ordinances, or otherwise illegal or unlawful, or would constitute any illegal infringement on the property and rights of the plaintiffs.  The defendant alleged: It has no intention that any business located on the property will be operated in any other than a lawful and proper manner.  During the 1947 session of the General Assembly, an amendment to the Constitution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Georgia was proposed, and duly ratified at the next general election, adding at the end of art. XI, sec. I, par. VI (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-7806), an amendment extending the zoning powers of the City of Macon and Bibb County.  The constitutional amendment vested in the City of Macon and Bibb County, separately or jointly, general legislative authority to promulgate zoning and planning laws, rules, and regulations, as a direct grant of authority by the people of Georgia.  Pursuant to such constitutional authority, a joint resolution and ordinance of the City of Macon and the County Board of Commissioners of Bibb County was passed and adopted, effective January 1, 1953, establishing a planning and zoning commission, providing for the appointment of the members, and defining its powers.  The Macon-Bibb County Planning and Zoning Commission, created by the resolution and ordinance, was duly organized, and has since exercised the jurisdiction and authority conferred upon it.  Since the date of its organization the commission has been the only governmental authority exercising any jurisdiction or authority pertaining to zoning, rezoning, districting, or redistricting within the limits of Macon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or Bibb County.  In June, 1953, the defendant filed with the commission its application for zoning for commercial purposes the area identified on the map attached to the petition.  Notice of the application was duly given, and all of the plaintiffs had actual notice thereof, and in subsequent proceedings the plaintiffs, personally or by attorney, were present and participated in the proceedings.  On April 5, 1954, the described property of the defendant was rezoned for commercial purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attached to the answer of the defendant was a copy of the joint resolution and ordinance of the City of Macon and the County Board of Commissioners of Bibb County, establishing a planning and zoning commission, to be known as &quot;The Macon-Bibb County Planning and Zoning Commission.&quot; The ordinance consists of some seven typewritten pages, and defines in detail the powers of the commission created, the time and place and manner of notice of public hearings and meetings, and all matters to be dealt with by the commission, and in section 4 it is provided in part: &quot;The powers and functions of the Commission shall be to hold hearings on all zoning, districting, re-zoning or re-districting matters whether&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  originated by private parties, by a governmental agency or by the Commission itself; to conduct such hearings as provided by law and its own rules and regulations; and to thereupon pass orders providing for the zoning, re-zoning, districting or re-districting of areas of the City of Macon and/or the County of Bibb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs demurred and moved to strike the defendant's answer, attacking the constitutional amendment set out in the answer upon a number of grounds.  The plaintiffs also amended their petition, attacking the constitutional amendment on grounds similar to those contained in their demurrers and motion to strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant filed two amendments to its answer, and on each occasion the plaintiffs renewed their demurrers and motion to strike.  The renewed demurrers and motion to strike the answer as amended were overruled.  Thereafter the parties entered into a stipulation of fact, and by agreement the matter was presented to the court to hear and determine all issues of law and fact.  A judgment was rendered denying the relief prayed.  The plaintiffs except to the order overruling their demurrers, and to the judgment denying the prayers of their petition.  </SPAN></P>

The petitioners alleged that the 1947 amendment to Ga. Const. art. XI, &sect; I, para. VI, which expanded the zoning authority of the county and the city, was invalid. The trial court refused to grant the injunction. The court affirmed and found that the commission had the authority to rezone the property. The court rejected the petitioners' contention that the constitutional amendment that conferred direct constitutional authority upon the city and the county to enact zoning laws and rules was not restricted or limited in territory and was so broad that they could undertake to zone property in other municipalities and counties. The court determined the constitutional amendment was not broad because when read with prior amendments the power to zone was limited to the territory within the city and the county.</SPAN></P>

Jackson filed his application for habeas corpus against C. K. Pittard, Sheriff of Gwinnett County, Georgia, alleging that he was being illegally held because he was not a fugitive from justice, had not been in the State of Michigan at the time the crime was alleged to have been committed, and had not fled the State of Michigan.  Plaintiff, by amendment, attacked as unconstitutional a named act of the General Assembly of Georgia, as violating stated provisions of the Constitution of the United States and as conflicting with certain acts of Congress passed pursuant thereto.

Thus he could not be extradited as such because the evidence was conclusive that he was not in Michigan at the time the crime was alleged to have been committed. Nor had he fled from Michigan.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John M. Hancock, Jr., filed his petition in the Superior Court of Bibb County, Georgia, against Mrs. Agnes L. Freeney, Treasurer of Bibb County, Georgia, in which he alleged: that one Joe Burke was indicted by a grand jury of Bibb County for a capital felony, to wit, murder; that the presiding judge appointed petitioner to represent the accused, upon a showing that he had no legal counsel and because of his poverty was unable to employ counsel; that petitioner represented said accused and thereafter filed application with the judge of the superior court for an award of attorney's fees pursuant to an act of the legislature approved by the Governor on January 5, 1954 (Ga. L. 1953, Nov.-Dec. Sess., p. 478 et seq.).  Thereafter, the court issued an order relieving and discharging petitioner from rendering further service to the said defendant, and ordered the Treasurer of Bibb County, Georgia, to pay the petitioner the sum of $ 35 as compensation for services rendered.  The Treasurer of Bibb County, Georgia, refused payment, and petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus to compel payment of said amount by the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Treasurer of Bibb County, Georgia.  To the petition the defendant filed general demurrers, attacking the constitutionality of the above-cited act upon a number of constitutional grounds which are set out in the opinion, and also filed an answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same day when John M. Hancock, Jr., filed his petition against the Treasurer of Bibb County, Georgia, she filed a petition against him, setting out substantially the same facts contained in his petition, which petition as later amended raised substantially the same constitutional questions to the act in question as were raised by her general demurrers to the petition filed against her.  She prayed that the order of the superior court be arrested, vacated, and declared invalid, that the rights of the parties be declared, and for further relief as the court determined proper.  John M. Hancock, Jr., filed general demurrers to the petition of the Treasurer of Bibb County, and also filed an answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon agreement of the parties the two cases were consolidated by order of the judge of the superior court, and certain stipulations were entered, those of which are pertinent to a decision of this case being included in the opinion.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that under the Constitution of the State of Georgia and the United States Constitution, criminal defendants were entitled to be appointed counsel to assist them in their trial if they could not afford an attorney. The Georgia Legislature also had passed a provision for payment of attorney fees for representing indigents accused of capital felonies. The court held that the Legislature, by its authorization of payment of certain fees and expenses to appointed attorneys in capital felony cases, created an expense of court within the meaning of the provision of the Georgia Constitution. Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4(1). Thus, the judges of the superior courts had the inherent power and authority to order the fees paid out of the county treasury pursuant to Ga.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a mandamus proceeding against the Superintendent of Banks of Georgia, seeking to require him to issue a certificate of approval to the Secretary of State, approving the application of a banking corporation for a charter.  After the proper application had been filed, the Superintendent refused to issue the said certificate, and the applicants filed a petition in Forsyth Superior Court, alleging that he wrongfully and improperly refused to issue the same, and prayed for a mandamus nisi, and that on the hearing thereof the mandamus be made absolute, to which the Superintendent demurred and filed his plea and answer.  As grounds of the demurrer he alleged that Code (Ann. Supp.) &sect;&sect; 13-1701 and 13-1702 are unconstitutional and void, in that they are in conflict with named paragraphs of the Georgia Constitution, and offend the doctrine of &quot;separation of powers,&quot; since the legislature has attempted to place an executive function in the juidiciary in the face of the fact that this function has been previously vested in the executive branch of the government by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Constitution.  The demurrer was overruled, and the cause proceeded to verdict and judgment in favor of the petitioners, the defendants in error here.  The Superintendent of Banks (the plaintiff in error) filed a motion for new trial with an amendment containing one special ground, which was overruled in the court below; and the exception here is to this judgment and the previous order overruling his demurrer, raising the constitutional question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voluminous evidence discloses, particularly in regard to the various investigative requirements of the Superintendent of Banks as set forth in Code (Ann. Supp.) &sect; 13-905, the following facts: (1) the population of the City of Cumming has increased slightly, while that of Forsyth County has decreased slightly during the last two decades; (2) between 1920 and 1930 there were three bank failures in Cumming when more than one bank attempted to operate; (3) in a radius of 28 miles of Cumming fifteen banks are now located and operating; and (4) the Bank of Cumming is in good financial condition, rendering adequate service, and being soundly operated.  The evidence is conflicting as to whether or not there was sufficient business to operate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  two banks in the community and no contest was made as to the character, reputation, and standing in the community of the officers and stockholders of the proposed bank.  An investigative report made by the Assistant Superintendent of Banks in accordance with law and on file in the office of the Superintendent of Banks, State Capitol, Atlanta, Georgia, was tendered in evidence, but the court refused to allow it in evidence, and this refusal is the ground of complaint in the special ground of the amended motion for new trial.  </SPAN></P>

The charter applicants filed a petition against the Superintendent, praying for a mandamus nisi to require him to issue a certificate of approval of the application. The trial court issued a writ of mandamus against the Superintendent and made the mandamus absolute. The Superintendent appealed, contending that O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 13-1701, 13-1702 were unconstitutional because they offended the doctrine of &quot;separation of powers&quot; by placing an executive function in the judiciary. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in making the mandamus absolute because the evidence failed to make a clear case of the Superintendent's failure or refusal to perform his official duties and that &sect;&sect; 13-1701, 13-1702 were constitutional. The remedy of mandamus, as provided for by &sect;&sect; 13-1701, 13-1702, was available to the charter applicants not for the purpose of controlling the Superintendent's discretion, but to compel him to exercise his discretion and to prevent his acting arbitrarily or capriciously.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Electric Company, a manufacturer of electrical appliances, brought suit against Cox-Gardner Furniture Dealers, a partnership composed of named individuals, seeking a restraining order, temporary injunction, and permanent injunction restraining the defendant from advertising for sale, offering for sale, or selling products bearing the trade-mark and trade name of the plaintiff at prices which were less than the minimum prices stipulated by the plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition was brought in three counts.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Count three of the petition alleges that defendants' conduct in selling plaintiff's products at less than the price stipulated by plaintiff is a violation of the so-called Georgia &quot;Fair Trade Act&quot; (Ga.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants in the court below filed a general demurrer to the petition, contending among other things that the so-called Georgia &quot;Fair Trade Act&quot; (Ga.

The manufacturer, in reliance on the act, sought to restrain the sellers, which had no contract with the manufacturer, from selling its branded products for less than the minimum prices set by the manufacturer. The trial court overruled the seller's demurrers. On appeal, the court held that the act violated Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">W. R. Humthlett, Jr., and six other persons, alleging themselves to be the owners of property adjoining or in the immediate vicinity of described land owned and held by the defendants, brought their petition in equity, seeking to enjoin Byron E. Reeves and E. N. O'Beirne from constructing and establishing a cemetery upon the land described in an unincorporated area of Cobb County, Georgia, and for a declaratory judgment as to the validity of the act of 1911 (Ga. L. 1911, p. 200), which purports to make applicable to Cobb County the provisions of the act of 1910 (Ga. L. 1910, p. 130), providing for the granting of permits by the county commissioner or other county authority of counties having a population of 125,000 or more for the establishment of cemeteries in unincorporated areas of such counties.  The petition as amended alleged that all of the land referred to in the petition, including that of various plaintiffs and of the defendants, and that upon which the defendants proposed to establish a cemetery, had been lawfully zoned exclusively for residential and agricultural&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  purposes by an ordinance adopted by the Commissioner of Roads and Revenues of Cobb County on October 12, 1939, with the formalities required by the act approved December 27, 1937 (Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 790).  The petition alleges that a permit previously granted to the defendants by the Commissioner of Cobb County in July, 1953, under the act of 1911, had been subsequently revoked, and that the defendants now had no permit; but, even if such permit had not been lawfully revoked, the permit was invalid because the statute under which it was issued was unconstitutional and void for the reasons hereinafter dealt with.  There are various other allegations made in the petition, but in the view we take of the case we do not deem it necessary to set them out in detail here.  The defendants denied that the permit granted to them in July, 1953, had been lawfully revoked; they denied that the act of 1911 under which it was granted was invalid for any reason assigned; they denied that the property had been lawfully zoned exclusively for agricultural and residential purposes, because, as they contend, the act of 1943 (Ga. L. 1943, p. 902), as amended by the act of 1949 (Ga. L. 1949, p. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1499), conferring upon the Planning Commission of Cobb County the power of zoning property, is unconstitutional and void for various reasons alleged in their answer; and, as they contend, the act of 1937, supra, conferring upon the Commissioner of Roads and Revenues of Cobb County the power to zone property, is invalid for various reasons which will be hereinafter dealt with.  It appears from the record that the property has been zoned exclusively for agricultural and residential purposes under the provisions of the foregoing acts, unless they and the zoning thereunder should be held invalid for some reason urged by the defendants.  The case was submitted to the trial judge to pass on all questions of law and fact without the intervention of a jury; and the judge rendered a decree: (1) that, under the acts approved August 9, 1910, and August 21, 1911, the defendant Reeves obtained from the Commissioner of Roads and Revenues of Cobb County, who was authorized to issue the same, a valid and binding permit dated July 2, 1953, and the same was, is, and remains entirely valid and lawful and authorizes the defendant Reeves to construct, maintain, and operate a cemetery upon the land involved; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (2) that the said acts of 1910 and 1911 are entirely constitutional, valid, and binding as against all attacks made by the plaintiffs upon the constitutionality or validity thereof; (3) that the purported revocation of the permit by the Commissioner of Roads and Revenues of Cobb County is illegal and void; (4) that the act approved December 27, 1937 (Ga. L. 1937-38, Ex. Sess., p. 790), is invalid and unconstitutional, and that any purported zoning thereunder of the land involved for purposes which would exclude its use as authorized in said permit is not valid and binding; and sustained the attack made upon that act and the zoning thereunder by the defendants, upon the ground that the act was void since the act approved August 15, 1921, which it purported to amend, was never adopted or never became effective because not ratified by a vote of the people under the referendum provided for in section 20 thereof.  To this judgment and decree the plaintiffs except.  </SPAN></P>

The owners contended that the cemetery's permit was revoked or it was invalid because the law under which it was issued was unconstitutional. The trial court ruled in favor of the cemetery. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the property had been zoned exclusively for agricultural and residential purposes. A case questioning the 1910 law was not res judicata because the owners were entirely different and were acting to protect their individual rights. Stare decisis did not apply because older full-bench decisions were binding on the court. The zoning ordinance was valid because it was the intention of the legislature to confer the power to enact zoning ordinances upon the county commissioner, and the court refused to hold the act invalid due to its mistaken reference to a 1921 act.</SPAN></P>

It was alleged that the defendant Mallin had leased from Hapeville Realty Investments, Inc., the ground level of the space to be occupied by the structure for the parking of automobiles, and that this defendant had caused Dalon Contracting Company, Inc., to begin the grading of the lot for the erection of the parking structure.

Wofford, building inspector of the city, was made a party defendant, it being alleged that the other defendants would apply for a building permit; and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it was asked that the issuance of such permit be enjoined, and that the other defendants be enjoined from proceeding with the proposed construction.  The petition as amended makes many attacks on the zoning law and certain ordinances of the city, and in so far as material to the judgment rendered these attacks will be considered in the opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A temporary restraining order was granted against the defendants as prayed, and the cause set for hearing.  By amendment the plaintiffs sought to have the Planning Board in the City of Atlanta made party defendant, and the board was ordered to show cause why it should not be made party defendant.  The previously granted restraining order was continued in effect.  After a hearing on its response, the Planning Board of the City of Atlanta was made party defendant, and temporarily restrained until the further order of the court from proceeding with any rezoning of the property of the other defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On interlocutory hearing, the previous restraining order was continued in effect, except that the defendant Mallin was permitted to prepare the rear 120 feet of the property for open-air parking, and the injunction against the planning board, restraining&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  them from holding a hearing or making recommendations as to the rezoning of the property of the defendants, was dissolved.  A supersedeas was granted to the dissolution of the injunction against the planning board, and a supersedeas was refused as to the preparation by Mallin of the rear 120 feet of the lot for open-air parking.  The plaintiffs excepted to the denial of the injunction as to Mallin and the preparation of the 120 feet for open-air parking, and to the dissolution of the restraining order against the planning board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff brought an action that sought to enjoin commercial development by defendants, a landowner, a lessee and a city planning board, and that challenged the validity of 1952 Ga. Laws 27312. After plaintiff obtained a temporary restraining order against defendants, the superior court dissolved the injunction against the board and allowed the lessee to prepare the property for open-air parking, and plaintiff sought review. On appeal, the court applied the rule of reasonableness of classification to the Act and held that it was not unconstitutional for any reason assigned. The court held that the board was not an invalid or unconstitutional board under the Act. Therefore the court held that the superior court did not err in the exercise of its discretion when it refused to enjoin the board from considering defendants' application to rezone property located in the district zoned for residence and apartment uses. The court ruled that the superior court erred when it permitted the grading and use of the property for open-air parking because there was no valid rezoning of defendants' property from residence and apartment uses to business and &quot;open-air parking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed that part of the superior court's judgment that dissolved an injunction that was issued against the board's consideration of defendants' application to rezone its real property. The court reversed that part of the superior court's judgment that permitted the lessee to grade and use the property at issue for open-air parking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">S. Paul Howard (the plaintiff in error, defendant in the lower court) was indicted in Bibb Superior Court on seventeen counts for embezzlement.  The indictment charges that as City Electrician of the City of Macon, a public officer in charge of a public department, station, and office of government of a municipal corporation, having in his possession, custody, and control certain named articles, the property of the city, he did unlawfully embezzle, steal, secrete, and fraudulently take and carry away the same, the language used being identical with that of Code &sect; 26-2801 describing a crime.  His demurrer and motion to quash the indictment was overruled and the case proceeded to trial.  After a conviction on certain of the counts, a motion for new trial was filed, amended, and, after a hearing, granted in part but denied in part.  The exceptions here are to this judgment, and a pendente lite exception to the overruling of the demurrer to the indictment, which raised certain constitutional attacks thereto.

Defendant was convicted on some of the counts, and he filed a motion for a new trial. The trial court granted the motion in part and denied it in part, and defendant appealed. Defendant also sought review of the pendente lite exception to the overruling of his demurrer. The court first held that the indictment was not subject to demurrer. However, the court reversed the trial court's judgment of conviction because the trial court erred by admitting prejudicial and irrelevant evidence of a purported embezzlement of certain I-beams. The I-beams were never shown to be the City's property. Thus, the evidence failed to show the commission of a crime. The evidence was not admissible under the similar-method rule because it failed to show a crime and was not so similar to the crime alleged in the indictment as to come within the exception to the general rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petition for injunction.  Before Judge Moore.  Fulton Superior Court.  June 1, 1954.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 16, 1953, the Georgia Public Service Commission, hereinafter referred to as the Commission, issued a rule nisi directed to both Georgia Power Company (hereinafter referred to as the Power Company), and Georgia Power and Light Company (hereinafter referred to as the Light Company), which, after reciting the previous proceedings before the Commission with respect to rates of the Light Company, and the Commission's opinion that it would be in the public interest if the areas presently served respectively by the two companies were integrated into a single operation, called upon them to show cause at a time stated: (1) why the Commission should not prescribe a rate schedule for the sale of electric energy by the Power Company to the Light Company (the Light Company now obtaining its power from its parent corporation, Florida Power Corporation) in sufficient volume to meet the entire power requirements of the Light Company, and why said rate should not be as low as the rate at which the Power Company sells electric energy to municipalities or REA co-ops, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or at what level said rate would be reasonable; and (2) why the Light Company should not be required to purchase its entire electric-power requirements or a substantial portion thereof from the Power Company at the rate prescribed by the Commission; and (3) why the Commission should not file a petition with the Securities and Exchange Commission, seeking an order from that agency which would provide for the divestment of the Light Company from the Florida Power Corporation and for the sale of said property at a fair price, either to the Power Company or as a separate and independent operating entity, whichever may finally be shown to be in the best interest of the people of the area served; and (4) why, in the event the Light Company be unwilling to purchase its power requirements from the Power Company at a reasonable rate, and in the event it be unwilling to sell its plant and equipment to the Power Company or others at a fair price, and in the event Florida Power Corporation is unwilling to sell its investment in the Light Company to the Power Company or others at a fair price, the Commission should not prescribe reduced rates for electric service rendered by the Light Company to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  substantially the level charged by the Power Company for the same classes of service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the service of this rule nisi upon it, the Power Company filed its petition in Fulton Superior Court, seeking by injunction to restrain the Commission from requiring it to respond to the rule nisi, upon the ground that the Commission was without jurisdiction to require it to do what was contemplated by the rule nisi, and therefore it could not force the Power Company to participate in a hearing to be devoted to such matter.  The petition alleges: that the Power Company is an electric public utility, engaged in the generation, transmission, and sale of electric energy at retail and wholesale within large portions of the State of Georgia, as shown on a map attached to the petition as Exhibit &quot;A&quot;; that the Light Company, a subsidiary of Florida Power Corporation is a neighboring public utility company engaged in the transmission and sale of electric energy in an area in South Georgia which is indicated on the map attached as Exhibit &quot;A&quot;; that the two companies are separate and non-associated electric utilities, each responsible for service within the particular area it has undertaken to serve, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and that the Commission has no power, authority, or jurisdiction to force the Power Company to provide the power requirements of the Light Company, or to force or in any way coerce the Power Company to acquire or to negotiate for the acquisition of property or to merge with the Light Company, and that the rule nisi is void and of no effect because: (1) the Power Company has never undertaken the obligation as a public utility to provide the power requirements of the Light Company or other comparable independent electric utilities; (2) the Commission has no authority to force the Power Company to render public-utility service outside of its territory or its commitments as a public utility; (3) the Commission has never before undertaken to regulate and control the purchase and sale of power by neighboring public-utility systems or to establish any rates applicable to such transactions, and the Power Company's action in this respect constitutes an exercise of managerial discretion on the part of the company; (4) the Commission, even if it should be successful in obtaining from the Securities and Exchange Commission an order directing the divestment of the Light Company from the Florida&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Power Corporation, has no statutory authority to require the Power Company to purchase the property of or to become merged with the Light Company; (5) the Commission is attempting to invade the functions of management, and no such power or control is vested in the Commission; (6) even if it be held that the Georgia statutes vest in the Commission jurisdiction and power which it is seeking to exercise, the statutes would be void and violative of the constitutional rights of petitioner, in that, to require it to render service beyond its commitments to the public service or to force or in any way coerce it to acquire or to negotiate for the acquisition of property, would constitute depriving it of its property without due process of law, contrary to the provisions of the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution and of the due-process and equal-protection clauses as set out in paragraphs II and III of section I, article I, of the Georgia Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is alleged: that, as the Commission has no right to regulate or control the Power Company in the respects contemplated by the rule nisi, it has no right to require the Power Company to come before it to show cause why it should not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  issue an order along the lines indicated; that a compliance with the rule by the Power Company would require considerable time on the part of its employees and considerable expense to the Power Company, and it would have no remedy to recoup its loss of time and money caused by the proposed illegal, void, and unconstitutional attempt to invade the rights of the Power company and to deprive it of its property without due process of law; that, under Code &sect;&sect; 93-416 and 93-9901, it would be subjected to severe penalties of as much as $ 5,000 for each offense, and its officers, agents, and employees subjected to criminal prosecution for failure to comply with any such invalid order that might be issued by the Commission, and that unless enjoined, the Power Company would be subjected to irreparable injury and damage and a multiplicity of criminal actions against its agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this petition the defendants demurred upon the grounds: (a) that the petition sets forth no cause of action; and (b) the petition shows on its face that the plaintiff had failed to exhaust its remedy before the Commission, having failed to make an appearance in response to the rule nisi.  To the judgment sustaining&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this demurrer and dismissing the petition the plaintiff excepts.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. F. Pritchard, a deputy sheriff of Richmond County, Georgia, from February, 1938, to August, 1953, petitioned the Superior Court of DeKalb County for issuance of a writ of mandamus absolute requiring the Board of Commissioners of the Peace Officers Annuity &amp; Benefit Fund of Georgia to certify his eligibility for a pension under the act of February 1, 1950, of the General Assembly of Georgia (Ga. L. 1950, pp. 50, 58) and direct payment to him of a pension under said act.  Briefly stated, his petition alleged the following facts: That, under the act of 1950, above cited, he made application and was admitted as a member of the pension fund and began making payments on January 29, 1951, and continued to do so through August, 1953; that on August 8, 1953, he made application for retirement under section 12 of the act, upon the ground that he was permanently and totally disabled, and that, notwithstanding he qualified in every respect required by the act, his application was disapproved on November 25, 1953.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner deputy sheriff challenged the decision of the Superior Court of DeKalb County (Georgia), which disapproved his application for disability benefits pursuant to the act of 1950, 1950 Ga. Laws &sect; 12, and dismissed his petition against respondent, the Board of Commissioners of the Peace Officers Annuity &amp; Benefit Fund of Georgia. The sheriff sought an action in mandamus to require the Board to certify his eligibility for benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 12 had provided for a pension for any officer who had become totally or permanently disabled after having served a required length of time. The sheriff made application for retirement under &sect; 12 on the basis that he was permanently and totally disabled. The sheriff contended that the act of 1951 &sect; 4, which repealed &sect; 12 of the act of 1950, was unconstitutional for the reason that it violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; X, para. I, U.S.C.S. &sect; 1-134, and Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; III, para. II, O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-302, which provided that no ex post facto law, retroactive law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts could be passed. The court affirmed the denial of the writ of mandamus because the constitutional provisions had not been violated. The court found that in the passing of the original act in 1950, the legislature specifically provided that all rights and benefits provided were subject to future legislative change or revision and that no beneficiary would have been deemed to have any vested right to any annuities or benefits provided therein. The court held that even if the sheriff had vested rights, there was no vested right to a continuation of the original plan.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained defendants' demurrer to the petition, and the owners appealed. The court held that the owners' contention that the notice of legislation was insufficient was without merit. The court found that, such a notice as that involved, signed by the duly elected representatives from the county in which the municipality was located, which proposed to amend the charter of a named Georgia municipality, necessarily referred to the General Assembly of Georgia, which would be in session within 60 days from the date of the first publication, since the Georgia Constitution required that such notice be published during a period of 60 days immediately preceding the introduction of the proposed legislation, and there was no contention that the notice was not published as required. The court also found that the words &quot;to define said limits of said city&quot; were sufficiently broad to include the extension of the corporate limits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Injunction.  Before Judge Pharr.  Fulton Superior Court.  April 22, 1954.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case arose when the plaintiffs (now plaintiffs in error) filed suit in Fulton Superior Court to enjoin the defendant Housing Authority from constructing a housing project in the City of Atlanta known as Project GA-6-7.  The plaintiffs alleged: that they were the owners of properties within the project area; that the area in question was not a slum; that no necessity existed for the project which would justify the taking of their properties; that the real purpose of the project was not to provide housing but to create a racial barrier; that the plan was not submitted to or considered by the State Housing Authority Board as required by law; and that the plan was ultra vires and void because it failed to conform to the city zoning ordinances as required by the State Housing Authorities Law.  It was also alleged that under the plan the housing would cost approximately $ 13,000 per unit, which was more than twice the sum required by private enterprise to provide similar accommodations; and that the expenditure of such sum constituted an unwarranted perversion of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  authority vested in the Housing Authority under the Housing Authorities Law.  By amendment it was alleged that the plan was unconstitutional and void because occupancy of the housing to be constructed was restricted to white people only.  The prayers of the petition were for an injunction and general relief, and by amendment facts were alleged for the purpose of showing an actual controversy, and asking for a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant filed an answer denying the material allegations of the petition, and demurrers directed to certain specific allegations.  At a hearing on the demurrers, the allegations concerning the cost of the project, violation of the city zoning laws, and restriction of the project to white persons, were stricken from the petition.  Exceptions pendente lite were duly filed to these rulings, and are now before this court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case proceeded to trial and, at the conclusion of the evidence, was submitted to the jury upon the following single question: &quot;The determination by the Housing Authority . . . to proceed with Project GA-6-7, upon the basis that there is a shortage of decent, safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low income within&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the area of the City of Atlanta, was (1) an abuse of discretion, or (2) not an abuse of discretion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found for the defendant, that its action was not an abuse of discretion.  The plaintiffs' amended motion for a new trial was denied, and the present bill of exceptions was sued out within 20 days thereafter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs complain of the ruling on demurrer striking three paragraphs of their petition; they complain on the general grounds of their motion for a new trial; and in their amended motion they insist that the court misconceived the law applicable to the case, and erroneously instructed the jury in such manner as to make a finding for the Housing Authority virtually inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant by cross-bill of exceptions complains of certain rulings on its special demurrers to the petition.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners brought an action seeking to enjoin the housing authority from taking their property in order to construct a housing project for low-income city residents.

The court found that there was no error in permitting the authority to condemn the property, even though the property had not been rezoned prior to the condemnation. The court determined that the landowners were not in a position to challenge the authority's alleged decision to only permit whites to occupy the new project because the landowners were not being unlawfully discriminated against. The court found that the landowners had no legal right to complain about the potential expenditures of the authority on the project. The court concluded that the lower court properly instructed the jury as to the pertinent standard of review and did not err in submitting only one question to the jury for its determination where the landowners did not propose any additional questions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Injunction.  Before Judge Atkinson.  Bibb Superior Court.  March 25, 1954.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case is an equitable one involving alleged trade-name infringement, brought by the plaintiff in error to enjoin the defendants in error from using in the name of their drive-in eating establishment in Macon, Georgia, the word &quot;Varsity,&quot; thereby engaging in unfair competition with the petitioner and infringing upon his trade name, &quot;The Varsity,&quot; under which he has continuously operated in Atlanta, Georgia, since 1928.  In the first appearance here, Gordy v. Dunwody, 209 Ga. 627 (74 S. E. 2d 886), this court ruled that the lower court was in error in sustaining both general and special demurrers in so far as the allegations relating to the trade name are concerned, but not as to infringement of trade-mark or in striking certain allegations as to interference with future expansion of the petitioner's business.  The case is now here after a trial in the lower court in which the jury returned a verdict in the form of answers to two questions submitted to the jury, the answers being against the contentions of the plaintiff.  The exception is to a judgment denying a motion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for new trial containing 29 grounds, 26 of which are special grounds added by amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven of the grounds complain of the allowance in evidence of certain testimony or refusal of the court to strike certain testimony of witnesses.  Grounds 4, 5, 10, 18, and 19 complain of the allowance in evidence of testimony as to the existence of other varsity eating establishments in other parts of Georgia and throughout the country.  The grounds of complaint, in substance, are that the existence of such eating establishments other than in Georgia was not a material factor, and the petitioner's claim is that he only has an interest in the name as it applies to drive-in eating establishments in Georgia.  Ground 9 complains of the allowance in evidence of information as to the status of Gordy's business, on the ground that it was irrelevant and immaterial since he was not claiming that this establishment had caused him to lose business.  Ground 11 complains of hearsay testimony as to what a group of boys had told a witness in a &quot;bull session&quot; as to the fact that the businesses were not connected in any way.  Ground 15 complains of testimony admitted in a deposition of one of the defendants that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  radio spot announcements of the Macon drive-in had contained the words &quot;locally owned,&quot; because the witness admitted he had not heard the radio spot advertisements.  Grounds 16 and 17 complain of the refusal of the court to strike testimony of a witness in regard to signs he had painted for eating establishments which contained the word &quot;Varsity.&quot; Ground 20 complains of the allowance in evidence of the testimony of the defendants' manager that neither business was affected by the other on the ground that it was an illegal conclusion of the witness.  Ground 21 complains of the admission in evidence of county court records showing the trade-name registration of a partnership, and its later dissolution to be thereafter conducted by only one of the partners, of an Augusta eating establishment using the word &quot;Varsity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six of the grounds complain of the exclusion of evidence.  Ground 6 complains of the exclusion of testimony of an employee of Gordy that a number of persons had complained to him of the quality of the food served in the Macon establishment.  Grounds 7 and 8 complain of the exclusion of evidence that Gordy had had trouble before in instances in which the word &quot;Varsity&quot; had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been used in the name of other eating establishments, and in one case in Cobb County he had obtained an injunction against the use thereof.  Ground 12 complains of the exclusion of testimony that at one time the defendants had thought to compromise the case with Gordy.  Ground 13 complains of the exclusion of testimony of one of the defendants, who also was in the brick business, as to what his attitude was in regard to other businesses using the same name as his brick business.  Ground 14 complains of the exclusion of testimony of another defendant with regard to the building and opening of Pig'n Whistle eating establishments in several other places in Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of the special grounds complain of excerpts from the charge.  Ground 24 complains of an excerpt that the jury, in determining whether or not the public would be likely to be deceived, would think of the public as composed of ordinarily prudent persons or reasonably cautious persons; the ground of complaint being that the test is not whether the public would be likely deceived, but whether a reasonably cautious person might be.  Grounds 25 and 26 are complaints as to excerpts that, in order for the plaintiff to prevail, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he must establish by a preponderance of evidence either that the word &quot;Varsity&quot; was used with the actual intention to deceive or mislead, or that it is such an imitation that the nature and probable tendency of such usage is to deceive the public, because it failed to charge that by the use of the word &quot;Varsity&quot; plaintiff had acquired a right in its usage such that its use by the Macon establishment in an area where plaintiff's establishment and good will was known he would be entitled to recover irrespective of any actual intent to deceive the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special grounds 27, 28, and 29 complain of the failure to charge as requested in writing, in substance, that (a) there was such an imitation here that a reasonably cautious person might confuse the two, (b) the mere fact that there are other eating establishments using the word &quot;Varsity&quot; would not constitute a defense, and (c) intent is one's state of mind and can be proved by circumstances from facts proved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grounds 22 and 23 are complaints of the failure of the court to submit special questions to the jury for findings of fact by special verdict, and because the court erred in submitting other special questions, and no others, to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the jury for findings of fact by special verdict.  The questions which were submitted and rejected were as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. Has the plaintiff used in his business the trade name 'The Varsity' for substantially the period of time set forth in his petition?  Answer yes or no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. Did the plaintiff register his trade name and trade-mark as set forth in his petition?  Answer yes or no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. Did the defendants, or any of them, know at the time of the commencement of their business by them in Macon, Georgia, known as 'Varsity Drive-In,' that the plaintiff had the right of use of the trade name 'The Varsity'?  Answer yes or no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. Is the business of the plaintiff in Atlanta, Georgia, and the business of the defendants in Macon, Georgia, of the same type that is, do they both serve food and beverages to their respective customers?  Answer yes or no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. Are the methods of the defendants in their business in Macon, Georgia, and of the plaintiff in his business in Atlanta, Georgia, substantially the same in the serving of their respective customers?  Answer yes or no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The questions actually submitted were as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. Was or is the use of the defendants of the word 'Varsity' in their&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  operations and trade name originally or subsequently with the intention of deceiving and misleading the public into the belief that the goods and services of the defendants are the goods and services of the plaintiff?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. Was or is the use by the defendants of the word 'Varsity' in their operations and trade name such an imitation of the plaintiff's operations and trade name that the nature and probable tendency and effect of such usage would be to deceive the public and pass off defendants' goods or business as that of the plaintiff?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint is that the questions offered by the plaintiff covered the issues of fact which the jury had to decide and were not covered by the actual questions submitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A motion to dismiss the bill of exceptions has been filed on the ground that it was tendered and certified twenty-six days after the judgment complained of here was rendered, and since it was filed too late this court is without jurisdiction.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trade-name owner sought to enjoin the alleged infringer from using the word &quot;varsity&quot; in the name of his drive-in restaurant.

The trial court denied the trade-name owner's motion for a new trial. On appeal, the alleged infringer filed a motion to dismiss the bill of exceptions on the ground that the bill was not timely filed. The court denied the motion where the time limit within which to tender a bill of exceptions was amended from 20 to 30 days, the amendment was valid, and the trade-name owner filed within 30 days. The court held, however, that: (1) where the trade name owner's request to charge the jury contained a statement that a jury could infer a charge was well founded from the fact that a witness did not appear to testify was an incorrect statement of the law and was rightfully rejected; and (2) it was not error for the trial court to charge the jury that in order for the trade-name owner to recover, the facts and circumstances would have to be such as would likely deceive the public.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schenley Industries, Inc., filed suit against Charles D. Redwine as State Revenue Commissioner of Georgia to recover various sums paid by it and its subsidiaries as income taxes alleged to be due by the Commissioner and his predecessors in office for the fiscal years ending December 31, 1938, through August 31, 1946, and the fiscal year ending August 31, 1948, the complaint being that claims for refund were filed within the time authorized by law but denied.  The petition is in ten counts and, in substance, alleges that the petitioner, the defendant in error, is a foreign corporation acting as selling company for its various subsidiary companies who are also foreign corporations; that all of the distilling and producing plants of the companies are located in various States other than Georgia, and the sales office is located in New York City; that the regulations of the State Revenue Commissioner have been met particularly with reference to the registration of brands, the designation of resident and nonresident representatives who are the only agents or employees&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Georgia and who solicit orders from customers in Georgia, which expressly provide that they are subject to written acceptance of the selling company in New York, such orders being forwarded first to the Revenue Commissioner for approval in accordance with the regulations and by him to the New York office, which alone had authority to accept or confirm the orders or offers to purchase; and that, if accepted, the products were shipped in interstate commerce by the distillery or producing company f. o. b. its distillery or producing plant to a State warehouse for the account of the wholesale customer in Georgia, and no accounts, collections, or billings were made in Georgia.  In addition the petition set out a portion of section 8 of the &quot;Wholesale Licenses&quot; chapter of the regulations, which provides: &quot;All alcoholic beverages, whiskeys and liquors shipped by distillers to a wholesale licensee in this State will be deemed to be the property of the wholesale licensee at the time the same is shipped.  . . .&quot; By reason of the above facts the petitioner alleges that neither it nor its subsidiary corporations have been doing business in Georgia within the meaning of the Georgia income-tax&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  statute and did not have or receive any income from property owned or business done in Georgia, and the taxes were erroneously and illegally assessed and collected in violation of the interstate-commerce clause and the 14th amendment of the Constitution of the United States, and deprived the petitioner and its subsidiaries of the equal protection of the law and their property without due process of law in violation of these particular Code sections of the Georgia Constitution; and by amendment adds that, if it be determined, as a matter of construction, that Code &sect; 92-3102 as amended and Code &sect; 92-3113 as amended were intended to subject them to Georgia income taxes for the taxable periods involved, then such statutory provisions are unconstitutional as being in violation of the above named clauses of the Georgia and Federal Constitutions, for the reasons set out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commissioner filed general and special demurrers and a plea of estoppel in bar which alleges that the petitioner and defendant, by and through Fred L. Cox, Deputy Director of the Department of Revenue, entered into an agreement in which petitioner and its subsidiaries, for and in consideration of the waiver of penalties&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the Commissioner due to their failure to file the proper returns and pay the taxes when due, are forever barred from reopening the question of income-tax liability for the said taxable years 1938 through 1947, inclusive.  Demurrers were filed to this plea, and after a hearing the court overruled the demurrers to the petition and sustained the demurrers to the plea of estoppel in bar.

The taxpayer paid the income tax demanded by the Commissioner, but filed an action for a refund. The trial court overruled the Commissioner's demurrer and he appealed. The court found that the Commissioner's regulations provided that whiskey sold became the property of the purchaser f.o.b. shipping point, therefore it was illogical for the Commissioner to contend that the taxpayer was selling liquor within the state. The Commissioner made a plea of estoppel in bar alleging that the taxpayer had made an agreement with a Department of Revenue deputy director not to reopen the issue of income tax liability. The court stated that the office of Revenue Commissioner was statutory, that its powers were conferred by statute, and concluded that the deputy director did not have the authority to enter into the agreement pled as a bar.</SPAN></P>

The bonds were to be repaid by tolls collected by the authority. The state officials challenged the constitutionality of the Act. The trial court upheld the Act's constitutionality. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that (1) the Act did not circumvent the constitutional prohibition on the state borrowing money because the revenue bonds were not debts of the state, (2) the Act did not grant public powers and privileges to a private corporation because the authority was an instrumentality of the state and a public corporation, (3) provisions of the Act which permitted the state to grant property to the authority were not illegal donations because the Act contemplated when the indebtedness of the authority was retired the property, including the constructed bridges, would be returned to the state, and (4) the fact that the authority was permitted to charge tolls for the bridge did not prevent it from being a tax exempt entity.</SPAN></P>

The sheriff's had sought a declaration that the Revenue Tax Act to Legalize and Control Alcoholic Beverages and Liquors (Act), Ga.

Because the petition only alleged that the Attorney-General was performing his official duties, there was no controversy between him and the sheriff. Similarly, there was no controversy between the county officers and the sheriff because although the petition alleged that the county officers conspired, conspiracy was not present when the facts alleged conspiracy to commit a lawful act. Consequently, the petition did not state a claim for a declaratory judgment and the court lacked jurisdiction to rule on whether &sect; 9-B of the Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">W. M. Peavy (now defendant in error) filed an equitable petition in Ware Superior Court, praying for a restraining order and injunction against the Chief of Police and other city officials of the City of Waycross (the plaintiffs in error), to prevent them from trying him for the sale of fireworks in violation of a municipal ordinance and from interfering with him in his business of selling fireworks, the allegations being, in substance: that he had a proper county license from Ware County to sell fireworks; that his business is outside the corporate limits of Waycross, but within one mile of the corporate limits; that cases have been made against him and he has been summoned to appear before the recorder's court for the alleged violation of an ordinance which prohibits the sale of fireworks in the City of Waycross and within the zone of its police jurisdiction, defined by its charter as extending one mile beyond its corporate limits, said ordinance being in violation of the Constitutions of Georgia and the United States; and that he has no adequate remedy at law, and equity jurisdiction is invoked to avoid&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a multiplicity of suits and to prevent prosecution of the cases made and the making of further cases.  By amendment the petitioner alleges that the section of the charter permitting police jurisdiction within one mile outside the corporate limits violated the Constitution of Georgia, in that the caption of the legislative act granting the charter afforded no indication of any purpose on the part of the General Assembly to extend the power of the City of Waycross beyond its corporate limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restraining order was granted and, after an interlocutory hearing, the court granted a temporary injunction.  The case proceeded to trial without the intervention of a jury on a written stipulation of facts, and a permanent injunction was granted; the decree of the court holding that both section 4 of the act of the General Assembly (Ga. L. 1909, pp. 1456, 1461), setting up the charter of the City of Waycross empowering it to exercise the powers enumerated outside the corporate limits and the ordinance pursuant thereto, are unconstitutional and void.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dennis Heard and Willie Garrett, individually and as Sheriff of the City Court of Buford, filed a petition for mandamus against C. K. Pittard, as the duly qualified and acting Sheriff of Gwinnett County and of the City Court of Gwinnett County, and Charles C. Pittard, as the duly qualified and acting Solicitor of the City Court of Gwinnett County.  In substance the petition alleged: On May 15, 1953, and on June 5, 1953, warrants were issued against Dennis Heard, charging him with possessing non-tax-paid liquor.  If any offense was committed by Dennis Heard, such offense was committed within the jurisdiction of the City Court of Buford.  Section 22 of the act creating the City Court of Gwinnett County (Ga. L. 1937, pp. 1184, 1191) provides: &quot;Be it further enacted, that it shall be the duty of the sheriff of said County of Gwinnett, to make appearance bonds in all criminal cases of which the City Court of Buford would have jurisdiction of, returnable to the City Court of Buford.&quot; The defendant C. K. Pittard, as sheriff, took bond in each of the two cases against Dennis Heard, made returnable to the City&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Court of Gwinnett County.  The defendant Charles C. Pittard, as solicitor, has drawn accusations against Dennis Heard in that court, and he will call the cases at the next term.  Dennis Heard will be forced to respond to the bonds and go to trial, or in his absence will be rearrested and confined to the common jail of the county, in which event Dennis Heard will suffer irreparable injury and damages, which cannot be adequately compensated in money.  Willie Garrett is the duly elected, qualified, and acting Sheriff of the City Court of Buford.  The cases against Dennis Heard are within the jurisdiction of that court, and Garrett, as sheriff, will sustain a monetary loss in the event Heard pays a fine in the City Court of Gwinnett County or in the Superior Court of Gwinnett County.  Each and every citizen of the City of Buford is entitled to have the cases returned to the City Court of Buford, and every citizen within the jurisdiction of that court has an interest in the disposition of the cases.  It is the official duty of the defendant C. K. Pittard to return the cases to the City Court of Buford, and this duty is mandatory in character.  The defendant sheriff threatens to return the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  cases to the superior court.  A demand has been made upon the sheriff to return the bonds to the City Court of Buford, and this demand has been refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayers were: that rule nisi issue requiring the defendants to show cause why a writ of mandamus and injunction should not issue; that pending the hearing on the application for mandamus the defendant, Charles C. Pittard, be temporarily restrained and enjoined from calling the cases against Dennis Heard for trial in the City Court of Gwinnett County, or from forfeiting the bonds; that the defendant sheriff be restrained and enjoined from arresting Dennis Heard or placing him in jail pending the disposition of the application; for process; and other relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants filed a demurrer to the application for mandamus, on the grounds that: (1) Only section 22 of the act creating the City Court of Gwinnett County is pleaded, and a construction of the entire act is necessary; (2) the allegations show no cause of action against the defendants; (3) there is no matter or thing of equity or equity jurisdiction set out, and the plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief prayed.

The owner filed special and general demurrers to the answer, which the trial court overruled. The parties stipulated to certain facts. On appeal, the court held that the stipulation of facts, together with the oral testimony, proved the allegations in the owner's petition and, therefore, that the trial court erred in granting the nonsuit. The court then considered the constitutional issues and rejected the owner's claim that these issue had not been properly raised. The court held that the statutes violated the Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Constitution of Georgia because they subjected the section foreman to automatic liability for failing to report the killing of stock of which he had no knowledge and regardless of any mitigating circumstances.

Sess., p. 2788), seeking to eliminate from the jurisdiction of the Cobb County Planning Board the property in question and providing that this property be zoned for cemetery purposes, was unconstitutional on a number of grounds.  Certain other acts of the legislature of 1910, 1911, and 1935, as will be set out in the opinion in this case, were also attacked on constitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge held that the act of 1953, supra, was unconstitutional.  He further held that, under the act of the legislature of 1943 (Ga. L. 1943, p. 902, sec. 9), &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the sole Commissioner of Cobb County had the right to issue a permit for the construction of a cemetery, and declined to invalidate a permit so issued.  The direct bill of exceptions complains of the ruling to the effect that the acts of 1910, 1911, and 1935 were constitutional, and the ruling refusing to invalidate the permit issued under the terms of these acts, and the judgment denying an injunction.  The defendants in the court below by cross-bill complain about so much of the judgment of the trial court as held the act of 1953 to be unconstitutional, and raised certain other objections which, under the view we take of this case, it is not necessary to state here.  </SPAN></P>

They also challenged refusals to invalidate a permit obtained by appellee permittees and to grant injunctive relief. The permittees filed a cross-bill challenging a holding that 1953 Ga. Laws 2788 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The residents sought to enjoin the permittees from building a cemetery on land that was near their properties and to invalidate a permit to build the cemetery that was issued by the sole Commissioner of Cobb County. The challenged acts empowered county commissioners to grant or refuse permits to establish specified institutions, including cemeteries, outside the limits of incorporated towns. Those acts were attacked as unconstitutional special laws, as the grant applied only to counties that had a specified population level or that were adjacent to counties with the requisite population level. The court held that 1953 Ga. Laws 2788 was invalid, as the legislature had no right to zone property and possessed only the authority to delegate the right to zone to counties and municipalities. The court held that the language in the challenged acts regarding population did not make those acts special laws and rejected claims that the challenged acts violated Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; IV, para. I and that they were repealed by 1943 Ga. Laws 905, &sect; 9. Finally, the court found it unnecessary to pass on the attacks made in the permittees' cross-bill on the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Because the statute was enacted after the commission of the crime, the State alleged that a jury instruction on the statute would violate express constitutional provisions prohibiting retroactive and ex post facto laws. The State also alleged that, since the jury found defendant sane and guilty of murder without a recommendation of mercy, any failure to charge the jury relative to statute was harmless error. The court held that the trial court committed reversible error in failing to charge the jury on the statutory provisions relative to insanity. The statutory requirements for a jury instruction on the insanity defense were for defendant's protection and did not constitute prohibited ex post facto conduct. Pursuant to his rights to due process, defendant was entitled to a jury instruction on the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ezra E. Phillips and Inslee M. Johnson, as residents and taxpayers of the City of Atlanta, brought an equitable petition against the City of Atlanta and certain of its officials, alleging: that they are illegally performing certain official acts and duties which are ultra vires in an area of Fulton County outside the jurisdiction of the City of Atlanta, thereby causing an unauthorized burden on the taxpayers of that city; that the area involved was prior to December, 1952, unincorporated, but that under the Municipal Home Rule Law of Georgia a special election was held in this area, which resulted in a vote in favor of incorporating the territory into the City of East Point, which has adopted and become subject to the home rule law; that said law is of a general nature operating throughout the State; that, during the process of annexation of the area to East Point, the General Assembly of Georgia passed a special act amending the charter of the City of Atlanta placing the described area inside the corporate limits of Atlanta, and on February 16, 1953, said&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  special act was approved by the Governor; that the special act violates art. I, sec. IV, par. I, of the Constitution, in that no special law shall be enacted in any case where provision has been made by an existing general law; and that Atlanta has no jurisdiction over the territory.  The prayers were for rule nisi and injunctive relief.  A demurrer was filed on several grounds, one of which was to the petition as a whole on the ground that all of the alleged rights of the petitioners were predicated in their entirety upon the Municipal Home Rule Law (Ga. L. 1951, p. 116, as amended by Ga. L. 1952, p. 46), and specifically section 3 (j) of said act as amended; and both said act and said section of said act are unconstitutional and void in that they are in violation of art. XV, sec. I, par. I of the Constitution of Georgia (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-8301), in that said act does not provide for uniform systems of county or municipal government, and provide for optional plans for both.  Upon the interlocutory hearing in pursuance of the rule nisi issued, the petitioners' prayers for injunction were denied and the petition was dismissed on demurrer, the court ruling that the Municipal Home Rule&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Act was unconstitutional in that it does not follow the constitutional directive of art.

The taxpayers brought the action to stop the City of Atlanta's incorporation of the area. The trial court found in favor of the City. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the General Assembly could not delegate its legislative powers under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-1301. The court found that under Ga. Const. art. XV, &sect; I(I), the General Assembly could have delegated its legislative powers only to the extent of allowing uniform systems of county and municipal governments to be established. The court found that the trial court's ruling that the Municipal Home Rule Act was unconstitutional was proper, and therefore, the City of East Point had no authority to annex the area.

The court found that while the Authority was an instrumentality of the state, it was nevertheless not the state, nor a part of the state, nor an agency of the state. It was a mere creature of the state, having a distinct corporate entity. Its revenue bonds, as &sect; 23 of the Act expressly and emphatically declared, were not obligations or debts of the state, nor a pledge of the credit of the state, but they were payable solely and exclusively from revenue derived from the use of its facilities. The court also found that the state was not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligated to levy or pledge any form of taxation toward the bonds or to make any appropriation for their payment.

The court concluded that it was without jurisdiction to determine the appeal because the constitutionality of the 1947 amendment was not at issue. The 1937 act gave persons injured in highway accidents the right to bring actions against non-resident motorists who were involved in accidents on Georgia's highways. The amendment did not extend the right to non-residents or anyone else. Rather, it assumed that non-residents had that right under the 1937 act and merely restricted venue in the case of non-resident plaintiffs to the county in which the accident occurred. Thus, plaintiff's right to bring the action in Georgia was under the 1937 act, which permitted him to bring the action in any county in Georgia, and plaintiff properly brought his action in Houston County even though it was also the county in which the accident occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Declaratory judgment.  Before Judge Crow.  Dougherty Superior Court.  December 24, 1952.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M. W. Tift, George B. Mock, and Mallory Lippitt, Commissioners of Roads and Revenues of Dougherty County, brought an action for declaratory judgment.  J. W. Bush, Clerk of the Superior Court, and D. C. Campbell Sr., Sheriff, were named as defendants.  The petitioners assert that the terms of an act of 1949 (Ga. L. 1949, pp. 1460-1465) are applicable to Dougherty County, and that the act is constitutional.  The petitioners have called on the defendants to comply with the terms of the act.  The defendants state that they have been advised by counsel that the act is unconstitutional and has no application to Dougherty County, and they do not intend to comply with the provisions of the act.  The prayers were that the court enter a judgment declaring the act to be constitutional and to apply to Dougherty County, and for other relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The act of 1949 (Ga. L. 1949, pp. 1460-1465) provides that it shall apply &quot;to all counties in the State of Georgia having, according to the official United States census of 1940, a population of not less than forty thousand inhabitants, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and not more than fifty thousand inhabitants, and to all counties in this State which may have by any future census of the United States a population of forty thousand inhabitants and not more than fifty thousand inhabitants.&quot; It is provided that in such counties the fee system for compensating the clerk of the superior court, sheriff, ordinary, tax collector, tax receiver, and tax commissioner shall be abolished (except fees paid by the State to the tax officials), and that the salaries of such officers shall be fixed by the commissioners of roads and revenues, or other county authorities, for the terms of such officers, at least ninety days before January 1, 1953.  The minimum and maximum salaries for all the officers are prescribed.  At least ninety days before January 1, 1953, the officers named shall furnish to the county commissioners a statement showing the assistants or deputies required by them, and the salaries recommended.  After January 1, 1953, all fees accruing to the various officials shall be collected for the use of the county, and the method of distribution of the costs and fees is provided.  The act is to take effect on January 1, 1953, except as concerning the determination&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of salaries and expenses, which part shall take effect on October 1, 1952.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The act shows an affidavit of the publisher of a newspaper in Troup County, accompanying the copy of a notice that legislation would be introduced applicable to Troup County, changing named officers from the fee to the salary system, and regulating the disposition of fees and costs.  Also attached was a grand jury presentment showing that the grand jury selected for the November term of the Superior Court of Troup County recommended to the county representative that a bill be presented at the 1949 session of the State legislature abolishing the fee system in paying county officials, and substituting a salary system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants filed separate answers, in which they contended that the act of 1949 is unconstitutional on numerous grounds, and that it applies only to Troup County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge entered an order declaring that the act applies only to Troup County, and that, if Dougherty County should come within the provisions of the act, it is unconstitutional because not advertised in Dougherty County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioners filed a direct bill of exceptions to this judgment.  The defendants, in separate cross-bills, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  excepted to that part of the judgment which held that the act was constitutional against all grounds urged except as set out in the judgment.  </SPAN></P>

Laws pp. 1460-1465, which required abolition of fees paid to certain officials in counties of a specified size. The Superior Court of Troup County (Georgia) found that the act applied only to its county and the commissioners appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">1949 Ga. Laws pp. 1460-1465 provided that counties with a specified population, according to the Census, should abolish a fee system for paying specified county executives. The commissioners sought declaratory judgment finding that that their county was affected by the law. The trial court found that provision inapplicable in the commissioner's county and they appealed. The court found that, from reading the act, it was intended to apply only to the county in which it was advertised as a special law, and the only county to which it applied at the time of its passage. Because it was a special law, not a general law, any change in population in the commissioners' county did not change the scope of the law. The court found that even where other counties might have fallen within the population brackets set forth in the law under some future census, the restrictions and limitations of the act would made it inapplicable to any county that met those limits in the Census after that specified in the act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undisputed facts before the trial judge were: The petitioner was being held by the respondent on a charge of violating an ordinance of the City of Atlanta, adopted in 1953, which made it a municipal offense to &quot;operate a motor vehicle of any kind upon any public street or alley in the City of Atlanta while under the influence of intoxicating liquors or drugs,&quot; which ordinance provided that one guilty of its violation was subject to a fine of not exceeding $ 500, and a sentence to work on the public works or streets not to exceed 60 days, any or all of these penalties in the discretion of the trial judge.  The petitioner contended that his restraint was illegal, because the ordinance he was charged with violating was unconstitutional, null, and void, in that, (a) it was a special law for which provision had been made by an existing general&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  law (Code, Ann.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mandamus.  Before Judge Humphrey.  Toombs Superior Court.  October 20, 1952.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 30, 1952, George R. Gay filed a petition against the City of Lyons, its mayor, clerk, and members of council, seeking a mandamus absolute.  The amended petition alleged substantially the following: On July 1, 1952, the plaintiff, the owner of an option to purchase a described lot in said city, filed his application with the clerk of the mayor and council to obtain a building permit for the erection of a filling station on his property.  At that time there was in existence an ordinance making it unlawful to erect any building within the city limits without first submitting the plan of such structure to the mayor and council and receiving a permit in writing authorizing the erection of the same.  On June 14, 1952, the mayor and council passed a resolution as contemplated by Georgia Laws 1946, p. 191, which authorized municipalities to enact zoning and planning ordinances and regulations, and appointed three members to constitute a planning board, and three members to constitute a board of adjustment.  On July 16, 1952, the planning board presented tentative zoning recommendations to the city, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under which tentative plan the property of the plaintiff was zoned for residential purposes.  The planning board held a public hearing on the tentative zoning plan, at which time the plaintiff appeared and filed written objections, in which he insisted that such plan violated stated provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions.  These objections were overruled, and the tentative plan was recommended for approval by the mayor and council.  Thereafter, the plaintiff filed similar objections to the proposed zoning ordinance with the mayor and council, which overruled his objections and approved the plans of the planning board without making any change in the same.  Thereafter, the mayor and council refused the plaintiff's application for a building permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was alleged that the plaintiff had complied with all laws and regulations of an ordinance of 1926, and with all laws and regulations of the city with reference to obtaining a building permit.  It was charged that the refusal of the permit was unreasonable, arbitrary, and discriminatory, and an unlawful interference with the plaintiff's property rights; that the zoning ordinance did not provide a comprehensive zoning plan as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contemplated by the act of 1946, and violated stated provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions; and that, unless the city be required to issue the permit, the plaintiff will suffer financial loss for which he cannot be compensated.  The plaintiff's prayer was for the issuance of a mandamus absolute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants interposed to the petition as amended a general demurrer, which was overruled, but so far as appears from the record the defendants did not except to said order.  The municipal authorities filed an answer, admitting certain allegations of the petition and denying others.  The answer asserted that the city could not issue a permit to the plaintiff because the city had adopted, on August 22, 1952, a zoning ordinance, and the location of the plaintiff's proposed filling station was zoned for residential purposes, and the city was without authority to issue a permit for the erection of a filling station.  They also filed what they denominated a &quot;plea in bar,&quot; which alleged that the plaintiff had filed with the municipal planning board his written objections to the tentative plan; that these objections were rejected, and subsequently the plaintiff filed written objections&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to said plan with the city council, and these objections were overruled.  Attached to this plea was a copy of the zoning ordinance which had been adopted by the city, which had placed the plaintiff's property in a district zoned for residential purposes only; that, under the act of 1946, appeals from the decision of the planning board shall be taken to the board of adjustment, and any party dissatisfied with the decision of the board of adjustment may appeal to the superior court.  No appeal to the board of adjustment had been filed by the plaintiff; and, as he had not exhausted all of his administrative remedies, and it would be illegal for the city to issue a permit for the erection of a filling station on property zoned for residential use only, the plaintiff is not entitled to the writ of mandamus, and the petition should be dismissed.  Subsequently, the defendants amended this plea in bar, and attached to the amendment the proceedings of the city council, the resolution showing the appointment of members of the planning board and of the board of adjustment, and the objections filed by the plaintiff to the proposed zoning ordinance, together with the zoning ordinance.  To the plea&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in bar as amended, the plaintiff filed general and special demurrers.  One of the grounds of demurrer was that the plea &quot;fails to set out or show that the plaintiff has any other legal remedy, except the remedy sought in plaintiff's petition, mandamus.&quot; Other grounds of demurrer were that the ordinance was invalid and void as violating certain provisions of the Federal and State Constitutions.  These demurrers to the plea in bar as amended were overruled, and the plaintiff filed exceptions pendente lite to this order, as well as to the order overruling his demurrers to the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 20, 1952, the trial court, without hearing any evidence, but on the pleadings, entered an order sustaining the plea in bar and dismissing the plaintiff's suit.  The case is in this court on a bill of exceptions, in which the plaintiff assigns error on the last order as well as on the orders complained of in the exceptions pendente lite.  </SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that: (1) the board of adjustment was an administrative agency and would have no authority or power to pass on the validity or invalidity of the zoning ordinance in question; and (2) because the sole defense of the city of the to issue the permit was that the zoning ordinance prohibited its issuance, if the ordinance, as contended by the property owner, was void, the property owner, in a mandamus proceeding that attacked the validity of the ordinance, could assert his right to the issuance of the permit by reason of the claimed invalidity of the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sam S. Johnson filed his petition seeking to enjoin the Housing Authority of the City of Atlanta and the City of Atlanta from carrying out a proposed redevelopment project in the City of Atlanta.  Knight Investment Company and Knight Ice Company intervened.  It was alleged that the redevelopment project was being undertaken by authority of and in conformity with the provisions of the Redevelopment Law of 1946 (Ga. L. 1946, p. 157).  It was contended that the law was and is invalid for a number of reasons, most of which revolve around the contention that the proceeding amounts to the taking of private property, including property of the defendants in error, through the power of eminent domain for private purposes.  A general demurrer to the petition and intervention was overruled, and the exception here is to that judgment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The homeowner claimed that the redevelopment project was being undertaken by authority of the Georgia Redevelopment Law of 1946 (Act) , which was alleged to be invalid and unconstitutional. It was alleged that the project amounted to the taking of private property, through the power of eminent domain for private purposes. The Act authorized the housing authority to make land acquired by eminent domain available first to private enterprise and then, only in the even the land was not taken by private enterprise within six months, to public agencies. In affirming the trial court's order, the court found that the very purpose of the Act was to sell the property to private individuals for private purposes, which was an unlawful use of the power of eminent domain. Ga. Const. Art. 4, &sect; 2, para. 1, provided that the power of eminent domain was to be used for a public purpose. The court held that the power of eminent domain could never be exercised to acquire property to be used by private individuals solely for private use and private gain. The Act provided for an unauthorized use of the power of eminent domain, and for that reason was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment, finding that the FTA was void ab initio because it was enacted at a time when the federal Sherman Act declared illegal every contract that provided for interstate resale price-fixing arrangements. The court rejected the manufacturer's argument that the FTA no longer offended the Sherman Act because the McGuire Act removed from the Sherman Act's prohibitions any contracts that provided for price fixing. The court held that the FTA was void ab initio because it violated the Supremacy Clause of the federal Constitution when enacted. The court stated that the FTA remained void, and subsequent amendments to the Sherman Act did not validate it because the removal of constitutional objections could not give an invalid law force and effect.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. G.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was prosecuted for on a misdemeanor charge of unlawfully and willfully refusing to make payments of wages and earnings to an employee. Defendant filed a general demurrer to the charge, which was overruled, alleging that O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 66-9901 and 66-102 were an unconstitutional violation of the prohibition against imprisonment for debt under Ga. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1, para. 21. The statutes authorized no prison time for a violation and provided only for a fine. On appeal, the court held that the two statutes were unconstitutional because although prison time was not authorized by either statute, the fact that the statutes authorized criminal prosecution constituted authority to imprison. The court reasoned that prosecution under the law required involuntary attendance of the accused at trial which would constitute a degree of imprisonment forbidden by the Georgia Constitution. As such, the court reversed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff city appealed the judgment from the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia), which declared that the Act of 1935, 1935 Ga. Laws p. 450, and the Act of 1945, 1945 Ga. Laws p. 1080, violated Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, para. 2 for reducing pension benefits of defendant firemen as fixed by the Act of 1924, 1924 Ga. Laws p. 167. The firemen were entitled to a monthly pension for life equal to one-half of their monthly salary at the time of retirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city argued that the Act of 1924, along with the amending Acts of 1931, 1935, and 1945, were unconstitutional because the city could not incur debt. Moreover, the city argued that the firemen waived their pension rights by accepting their monthly pensions as calculated under the Acts of 1935 and 1945. The firemen countered that the amending Acts of 1935 and 1945 were unconstitutional because the acts deprived them of vested contract rights acquired under the Act of 1924, as amended by the Act of 1931. The court affirmed the trial court's declaratory judgment. The court found that the general purpose of the Act of 1924 was to create pensions in favor of the retired firemen and to provide funds necessary for their payment. The court ruled that the amending Acts of 1935 and 1945 were unconstitutional because the reduction in the firemen's pension benefits impaired the firemen's pension contracts and deprived them of vested contract rights. Moreover, the court determined that the city was not disadvantaged by the conduct of the firemen, and the firemen did not expressly or impliedly waive their pension rights under the Act of 1924, as amended by the Act of 1931.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">W. M. Barge, R. M. Moreland, and Clyde Morris Jr., as plaintiffs, alleging themselves to be taxpayers, citizens and registered voters of that portion of Fulton County without the corporate limits of the City of Atlanta, brought an equitable petition, against Thomas L. Camp, I. Gloer Haley, R. L. Doyal, J. H. Aldredge, and Jack Towns, Commissioners of Roads and Revenues of Fulton County, A. E. Fuller, County Manager of Fulton County, Mrs. Mabel Abbott MacNeill, Treasurer of Fulton County, G. Neal Ellis, Chief of the Fulton County Police Department, and the City of Atlanta, wherein they attacked the constitutionality of the act of the General Assembly approved February 21, 1951 (Ga. L. 1951, p. 591), upon various grounds which will be hereinafter referred to, and seek to enjoin the County Commissioners of Fulton County from entering into a contract with the City of Atlanta to supply police services in the unincorporated areas of Fulton County, to prevent them from transferring to the City of Atlanta all of the motor vehicles, crime-laboratory equipment, weapons, filing equipment, and other&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  equipment of all kinds used by or assigned to the Police Department in the normal course of its operation, alleged to be of the value of $ 300,000, and to prevent the payment from the county treasury of approximately $ 131,000 to the City of Atlanta for such services, and to restrain and enjoin each and all of the defendants from doing anything or committing any act the effect of which will cause the property of the county to be transferred and delivered to the City of Atlanta, and from paying over to the City of Atlanta by check or otherwise any of the funds belonging to and in the treasury of the county, and to declare null and void the resolution attempted by the Fulton County Commissioners, and the proposed contract to be executed by them and the City of Atlanta under the terms of said act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The act here attacked, which is an amendment to Chapter 23-14 of the Code, and which authorizes all counties of the State to elect or appoint county police, and to levy a tax for the expense thereof, provides substantially: (1) It applies to all counties in which there is located all or the greater part (of the population) of a city or municipality with a population of 300,000 or more, according&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the U. S. census of 1950 or any future U. S. census.  (2) It declares that police problems in large urban areas are different from those in less populated areas, and that it is more economical to have one large department than two or more small ones.  (3) The act shall become effective on June 1, 1951, as to any counties to which it applies according to the U. S. census of 1950; and, as to any other counties as to which it shall become effective according to any future census, it shall become effective on June 1st of the first calendar year after the year in which such census was taken.  In all counties in the latter category the year in which it becomes effective and the first year thereafter shall be substituted for the years 1951 and 1952, respectively, wherever such years are mentioned in the act.  (4) The county commissioners of the counties involved shall determine what police services are needed in the unincorporated areas of the county and shall certify to the city involved the needs of the county for police services.  (5) The city involved shall furnish to the county such services as are needed at actual cost.  (6) Any county to which the act applies, desiring to have a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  county police force after the end of the year in which it is required to contract therefor shall not be authorized to have an independent police department.  (7) The city policemen shall have power to make arrests outside the incorporated areas as well as inside.  (8) The county shall transfer to the city all of the motor vehicles, crime-laboratory equipment, weapons, filing equipment, and other equipment of all kinds used by or assigned to the county police department prior to being discontinued, as required by the act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is alleged by the plaintiffs that under this act, the proposed contract between the county commissioners and the City of Atlanta pursuant thereto, and the transfer of property and the payment of money by the county authorities to the City of Atlanta thereunder, are all unconstitutional, illegal, and void because against the public policy of the State, and are violative of and repugnant to the following provisions of the Constitution of the State of Georgia:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 1, section 4, paragraph 1 (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-401), which provides that &quot;Laws of a general nature shall have uniform operation throughout the State, and no special law shall be enacted in any case for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which provision has been made by an existing general law,&quot; in that the act by the classification therein contained applies only to Fulton County, and is in conflict with the general law of Chapter 23-14 of the Code providing for county police, and in conflict with the general law known as the County Purchasing Act of 1941 (Ga. L. 1941, p. 408), and in conflict with the general law contained in Code &sect; 91-804 with respect to the manner of disposing of county property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 11, section 1, paragraph 7 (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-7807, dealing with the method of consolidating county and municipal governments, and article 15, section 1, paragraph 1 (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-8301), dealing with the right of the General Assembly to provide for uniform systems of county and municipal governments and for optional plans of both, in that the act here merges and consolidates part of the county government with the city government, and accomplishes by piecemeal what these provisions of the Constitution prohibit being done as a whole except in the manner therein provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 7, section 4, paragraph 1 (8) (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-5701), which authorizes a county to levy a tax to pay county police, and article 7, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  section 1, paragraph 2 (Code, Ann., &sect; 5402), which provides that &quot;The General Assembly shall not by vote, resolution or order, grant any donation or gratuity in favor of any person, corporation or association.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is further alleged and insisted by counsel in their brief that the act here under attack is against the public policy of the State, and that it tends to impair the right of local self-government by the county authority and to centralize governmental power in the City of Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is contended that for all of these reasons plaintiffs, as taxpayers and citizens of the unincorporated area of the county, are being deprived of the equal protection of the law and of their rights and property without due process of law in violation of article 1, section 1, paragraph 1 (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-101), paragraph 2 (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-102), paragraph 3 (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-103), and of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States (Code, &sect; 1-815).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this petition as amended the defendants, except R. L. Doyal, interposed their general demurrers upon the grounds: that the petition stated no cause of action; that the alleged injury to the plaintiffs is vague, indefinite, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and shows no damage, loss, or substantial injury to the plaintiffs' personal or property rights; that the petition is premature because any damage to the plaintiffs is speculative, apprehensive, and remote; that the plaintiffs are not as a matter of law entitled to any particular police protection, and the question of what protection will be afforded the unincorporated areas of Fulton County is a matter for the county commissioners to determine, and their discretion cannot be controlled by the court; that it affirmatively appears from the petition that all of the acts sought to be restrained can be legally done by the defendants under a contract with the City of Atlanta pursuant to the Constitution of 1945, and it appears affirmatively from the allegations of the petition that Fulton County and the City of Atlanta are proceeding in accordance with the said constitutional provisions and not otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were various grounds of special demurrer by the City of Atlanta, but the special demurrers were not passed upon by the trial court, which sustained the general demurrers of the defendants and dismissed the petition.  To this judgment the plaintiffs except.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, taxpayers of the unincorporated area of Fulton County, sought review of an order of the Fulton County Superior Court (Georgia), which sustained the general demurrers of defendants, the county commissioners, county officers, and city, and dismissed the petitioners' action to enjoin defendants from entering into a contract pursuant to a newly enacted statute, 1951 Ga. Laws p. 591, to transfer county police operations to the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petitioners contended that the act was unconstitutional and violated the public policy of the state because it impaired the right of local self-government by the county authority and centralized government power in the city. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal because the petition failed to state a cause of action. The act was not a special law in contravention of Ga. Const. art. 1, &sect; 4(1) as it did not affect Fulton County alone, but had the potential to affect other counties as the population of cities grew. Nor did it violate Ga. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1(7), dealing with consolidation of county and municipal governments or Ga. Const. art. 15, &sect; 1(1), the home rule provision, as it did not undertake to consolidate or reorganize city and county government. Instead, Ga. Const. art. 7, &sect; 6(1) allowed municipalities or counties to contract with each other to provide services such as police protection. Because the act was specifically authorized by the state constitution, petitioners were not deprived of their rights under U.S. Const. amend XIV.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rape.  Before Judge Shaw.  Fulton Superior Court.  January 11, 1952.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Avery was arrested on October 29, 1950, for the offense of rape in Walker County, and was committed to jail.  At the February, 1951, term of Walker Superior Court he was informed by the solicitor-general of the judicial circuit in which Walker County is located that an indictment charging him with rape would be presented for grand-jury action during that term of the court.  Prior to indictment, he filed a written challenge to the array of grand jurors, alleging that the grand jury had not been legally organized.  His challenge was based on the grounds that Code &sect; 59-106, which requires the jury commissioners to select jurors from the books of the tax receiver, offends stated provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions; that no negro has ever been appointed to membership on the board of jury commissioners in Walker County, but negroes, because of race and color, have been systematically excluded from service thereon; and that no proper jury lists and jury book have been made up and kept for inspection as required by Code &sect; 59-109.  Concerning this it was stipulated: &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The accused is a negro man; his alleged victim is a white woman.  No negro has ever been appointed to membership on the board of jury commissioners for Walker County.  According to the Federal census for 1950, Walker County has a population of 38,265.  The tax digest shows that Walker County, in 1950, had 9364 registered white property owners and 464 registered colored property owners.  The jury commissioners revised the lists of grand and traverse jurors for Walker County in 1950, selecting for such service only those men whose names appeared on the 1950 tax digest for the county.  At the hearing of the challenge an alphabetical list of names, certified by the clerk of the superior court and the six jury commissioners for Walker County as being a correct list of the names of those selected for grand and traverse jury services at the board's meeting, which convened on August 14, 1950, was tendered by the accused and allowed in evidence.  Another alphabetical list, by militia districts, and headed &quot;Grand and Traverse Jurors, 1950,&quot; but not signed by anyone was also tendered by the accused and allowed in evidence.  The letter &quot;G&quot; appears opposite the respective name of several jurors&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appearing on the latter list, and the following certificate, dated May 22, 1951, is attached thereto: &quot;Georgia, Walker County.  I, Thos. W. Bryan, Clerk Superior Court in and for said County do hereby certify that the foregoing is a true and correct copy of the original Grand and Traverse list, by districts, now remaining on file in this office.&quot; No evidence explanatory of the letter &quot;G&quot; was offered by either party, but it was stipulated that the two lists introduced by the accused &quot;have been on hand in the Clerk's office ever since October 29, 1950, which is the date of the alleged crime, that they have been available for public inspection, and that at all times there has been a person present at all usual office hours who could and would explain those lists to any person that might be interested as to which were members of the grand jury and which were members of the traverse jury box.&quot; No contention was made that the challenged grand jurors were not regularly drawn from the grand jury box.  The objection to the grand jury was denied, and the accused excepted pendente lite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accused was indicted for rape.  He moved for a change of venue which was subsequently granted and his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  case was transferred to Fulton County for trial.  Upon being arraigned for trial in Fulton County, he filed a written challenge to the array of traverse jurors put upon him, alleging in the first six paragraphs of his challenge, that the trial jurors furnished him had been illegally selected and impaneled, because Code &sect; 59-106, which requires the jury commissioners to select jurors from the books of the tax receiver, offends stated provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions; and, in the remaining paragraphs, because the selection of 20,509 white jurors and 1115 colored jurors from a total number of 105,035 white and 17,736 colored taxpayers is an excessively small number of jurors actually selected for service, and the number of colored jurors when compared with the number of white jurors actually selected is excessively disproportionate and the result of a deliberate and systematic exclusion of a required proportionate number of the negro race for jury service; that, in making up the jury box, the jury commissioners have placed the names of white and colored jurors on slips of paper of different colors, the names of the white jurors being placed therein on white slips and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the names of the colored jurors being placed therein on yellow slips; that the jury commissioners have not supplied the Clerk of the Superior Court of Fulton County with a proper list of those traverse jurors selected for service as required by Code &sect; 59-109; and that no legal and proper list of traverse jurors has been kept on file in the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Fulton County as required by law, and by reason of such failure the accused has been deprived of his right to examine the same and ascertain if the jurors put upon him have been legally selected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A general demurrer interposed by the State was sustained to the first six paragraphs of the challenge and was overruled to the remaining grounds thereof.  The accused excepted pendente lite to that part of the judgment which was adverse to him.  Concerning this challenge, it was stipulated that Fulton County, in 1950, had a population of 671,797, of which 505,983 were white and 165,814 were colored people, and that tax returns were made in 1950 by 105,035 white and 17,736 colored taxpayers.  On the hearing of his challenge the accused introduced three witnesses, who testified in brief as follows: The jury commissioners&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for Fulton County select all grand and traverse jurors exclusively from the books of the tax receiver, his tax digest, but no one is selected or rejected for jury service because of race or color.  The present jury lists for Fulton County were completed on July 25, 1949.  They were made by the jury commissioners from the tax returns of white and colored people for 1948.  In its last revision of the jury lists the board of jury commissioners employed the following procedure: Employees of the board made a card for each separate taxpayer of the county from a bound volume of individual tax returns.  From these cards the jury commissioners selected those best qualified for jury duty, making a list of the same as selections were made.  The list was then turned over to a printer who made copies of it, after the jury commissioners had checked his proof copy against the original list.  From the printer's copies tickets were made and placed in the jury boxes by the jury commissioners and one printed copy was retained intact and placed in a binder, upon the cover sheet of which was attached a certificate by the jury commissioners and the Clerk of the Superior Court of Fulton County, certifying&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that it contained the names of those selected for jury service by the jury commissioners.  In keeping with a practice which has been carried on in Fulton County for fifty years or more, the names of white jurors are placed in the jury boxes on white slips and the names of colored jurors are placed in the jury boxes on yellow slips.  This is done for the purpose of aiding the sheriff in locating and summoning individual jurors.  The challenged jurors were regularly drawn from the traverse-jury box by one of the Judges of the Superior Court of Fulton County, without regard to race or color and both white and colored traverse jurors were drawn.  It is a common occurrence for both white and colored jurors to serve.  Five colored grand jurors served at the July-August, 1951, term of the court.  An entire panel or more of colored traverse jurors sometimes serves.  A method adopted and practiced by the Judges of the Superior Court of Fulton County in drawing juries prevents any discrimination in jury service as between the white and the colored jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The objection to the trial jurors was overruled, and the accused excepted pendente lite.  The case resulted in a verdict of guilty, without&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  recommendation, and the accused was sentenced to be electrocuted.  His motion for a new trial, which was amended by adding several special grounds, was overruled.  The accused excepted and sued out a writ of error to this court, assigning error upon the judgment overruling his amended motion for new trial and upon his pendente lite exceptions.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction, after a jury trial, from the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia) for rape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant broke into a house, pulled a prosecutrix out of the house, and had intercourse with her forcibly and against her will. Affirming, the court said that the verdict was amply supported by evidence. No reason appeared for interfering with the trial judge's discretion in refusing a new trial. Defendant offered no evidence, but tried to set up an alibi defense. It was proper to allow photographs of the prosecutrix's body and witness testimony that the photographs correctly portrayed her bruised condition. The photographs and the testimony were relevant, material, and clearly admissible. Defendant claimed error a failure to grant a mistrial after the prosecutrix made an incomplete statement that she knew defendant had killed. The trial court instructed the jury not to consider the statement. No abuse of discretion was shown after the issue was effectively removed by the trial court's action. Defendant also claimed error in refusing a mistrial after the State made an argument to the jury about putting a stop to beating women. The remark, allegedly improper, was not of such a character as to require a new trial for an error in refusing a mistrial when the remark was made.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Henry Giles filed a petition for habeas corpus against H. H. Gibson, as Superintendent of the City Prison of the City of Atlanta.  It was alleged that the illegal detention of the petitioner by the respondent was under a purported sentence by the deputy recorder of the city on purported charges of being &quot;drunk under the steering wheel.&quot; A duly certified copy of the ordinance under which the sentence was imposed was attached to the petition as an exhibit.  It was alleged that the ordinance of the city was unconstitutional, null, and void because at the time of its enactment there was a general law in force (Code, &sect; 68-307), and the ordinance violated the Constitution, art. 1, sec. 4, par. 1 (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-401), providing that laws of a general nature shall have uniform operation throughout the State, and no special law shall be enacted in any case for which provision has been made by an existing general law.

Defendant was sentenced to prison, and he petitioned for habeas corpus relief on the ground the municipal ordinance was unconstitutional because there was a general law in force prohibiting similar conduct. The trial court denied the petition, and the prisoner appealed. The court reversed. The mere fact that a special law, such as the municipal ordinance here, dealt with element of the general subject embraced in the general law which was not specifically dealt with in the general law did not permit its enactment. The General Assembly wished that portions of a subject dealt with by a general statute remained free from regulation by local law. The court further held that the fact that the prisoner's term of incarceration had ended by the time of its ruling did not prohibit a grant of the petition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second appearance of this case before this court.  See Williams v. O'Connor, 208 Ga. 39 (65 S. E. 2d, 890), where a full statement of facts will be found.  On the previous appearance of this case, the judgment of the court below refusing a new trial was reversed.  Before the remittitur of this court was made the judgment of the court below, defendants in error filed an amendment to the original petition, which laid out new demises.  This amendment was allowed, subject to demurrer, motion, and objection.  Plaintiffs in error filed their answer to the petition as amended, and their demurrer, motion to strike the amendment, and their plea in abatement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the case came on for trial, and after the remittitur of this court had been made the judgment of the court below, defendants in error offered a second amendment, alleging that there had been no administration of the estate of Thomas O'Connor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants in error made an oral motion to overrule and dismiss the motion to strike the amendment, and an oral motion to strike the plea in abatement.  The grounds of both these oral motions made&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the defendants in error were, that the act of the General Assembly of Georgia, approved March 27, 1941 (Ga. L. 1941, pp. 487-489; Code, &sect;&sect; 67-1308 -- 67-1315), is unconstitutional and void insofar as it applies to the security deed here under consideration; &quot;That said act is violative of article 1, section 3, par. 2, Constitution of Georgia adopted in 1877, in force when the deed was executed, and of the Constitution of Georgia of 1945, where the same provision is found as article 1, section 2 . ., and also of the Constitution of the United States, article 1, section 10 . . which provision of the Constitution of Georgia and of the United States prohibits the passage of a retroactive law or a law impairing the obligation of a contract.&quot; The oral motions of the defendants in error also set out that the declaration had been amended to meet the objections set out in Williams v. O'Connor, supra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge of the court below, after hearing argument, entered an order holding the above act unconstitutional, dismissing and overruling the motion to strike the amendment, and striking and dismissing the plea in abatement, and allowing the second amendment alleging that there had been no administration&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the estate of Thomas O'Connor.  To these rulings, plaintiff in error filed exceptions pendente lite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case then proceeded to trial.  During the trial, defendants in error offered in evidence the security deed conveying the land sued for in this action.  This evidence was objected to on the ground that it was more than 20 years past due, and that under the act of 1941, supra, and the decision of this court in Williams v. O'Connor, supra, the deed was inadmissible and was no evidence of title because title had reverted to the grantor.  The evidence was admitted, and the act of 1941, supra, was held to be unconstitutional.  To this ruling plaintiff in error excepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all the evidence was in, counsel for both sides moved for a directed verdict, and a verdict was directed in favor of plaintiffs in ejectment, defendants in error here, and judgment was entered in accordance with that verdict.

Defendants in error made an oral motion to overrule and dismiss the motion to strike the amendment, and an oral motion to strike the plea in abatement. The grounds of both motions were that the Act of March 27, 1941 (Act), 1941 Ga. Laws 487-489, was unconstitutional. The trial court found the Act unconstitutional. The court reversed on appeal because the statute was involved in the first trial of the case, however the constitutionality of the statute was not attacked at that time. Defendant in error had, at that time, an opportunity to raise the question of the constitutionality of the Act, but failed to do so. He could not do so during the second trial, as the issue was deemed abandoned.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 6, &sect; 14(4) (O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-4904), suits against joint trespassers residing in different counties could be tried in either county. Where a petition for injunction, brought in the county where one defendant resided, sought relief against joint trespasses by all defendants, the trial court was not without jurisdiction even though all but one defendant were residents of other counties of the State. The court held that this was true, even though the resident defendant might have been acting only as agent of or under the command, direction, or authority of other defendants in the commission of the trespasses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents, pension fund trustees, appealed a judgment from the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia) that granted petitioner retiree a writ of mandamus to compel the trustees to issue vouchers for the payment of benefits and to enter an order showing officially that he was legally entitled to a certain monthly pension, under the Firemen's Pension Act of 1924, 1924 Ga. Laws 167, and the Firemen's Pension Act of 1924, as amended by 1931 Ga. Laws 223.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The writ of mandamus worked to compel the trustees to pay the retiree the benefits to which he was entitled under the Firemen's Pension Act of 1924, 1924 Ga. Laws 167, and the Firemen's Pension Act of 1924, as amended by 1931 Ga. Laws 223. The underlying action arose when the trustees refused to pay those amounts under authority of 1935 Ga. Laws 450, which amended the two Pension Acts and effectively lowered the retiree's benefits. On appeal, the court ruled that: (1) under O.C.G.A. &sect; 64-101, the retiree's allegations clearly showed that he, as a retired municipal fireman with a continuous and uninterrupted service of 25 years and more, was legally entitled to a monthly pension from the trustees in the amount claimed; (2) the retiree's right to institute mandamus proceedings for the enforcement of his cause was not barred by the 20-year statute of limitations, O.C.G.A. &sect; 3-704; and (3) the trustees' claim on information and belief that the city had disbursed all revenue collected by it during prior years and could not lawfully assess and collect taxes for the payment of the retiree's claim was insufficient to bar issuance of mandamus absolute, under O.C.G.A. &sect; 64-106.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles G. Duncan, as Chairman of the Milk Control Board, hereafter referred to as the Board, filed a petition in the Superior Court of Mitchell County against J. J. Harris, trading as Harris Pedigree Farms, and Camilla Dairies, hereafter referred to as Harris.  The petition as amended alleged: that under the act of 1937 (Ga. L. 1937, p. 247) as several times amended, and known as the Milk Control Law (Code, Ann. Supp., &sect; 42-523 et seq.), the Camilla Milk Shed, comprising all of Mitchell County, had been established under the terms of the act, and pursuant thereto the Board had set the price of milk at 23 cents per quart in said milk shed; that Harris was in the territory of that shed and subject to the terms of the Milk Control Law, and was violating the law by selling milk at less than the minimum price established under the act; and that the application of Harris for a license had been denied after a hearing.

The court held that before the Georgia General Assembly was able to authorize price fixing without violating the due-process clause of the Georgia Constitution, it must have been done in a business or where property involved was &quot;affected with a public interest.&quot; The court found that the milk industry did not qualify as being a business affected with a public interest, notwithstanding that the public or the General Assembly would have had a feeling of concern in regard to its maintenance. The milk industry had not been devoted to a public use and, thus, its use was not granted to the public.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The housing act of 1937 was amended by the legislature in 1939 (Ga. L. 1939, p. 112), and section 4 of the act as amended is as follows: &quot;In each city (as herein defined) and in each county of the State there is hereby created a public body corporate and politic to be known as the 'Housing Authority' of the city or county; Provided, however, that such authority shall not transact any business or exercise its powers hereunder until or unless the governing body of the city or the county, as the case may be, by proper resolution shall declare at any time hereafter that there is need for an authority to function in such city or county.  The determination as to whether there is such need for an authority to function (a) may be made by the governing body on its own motion or (b) shall be made by the governing body upon the filing of a petition signed by 25 residents of the city or county, as the case may be, asserting that there is need for an authority to function in such city or county and requesting that the governing body so declare.  The governing body shall adopt a resolution declaring that there is need for housing authority&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the city or county, as the case may be, if it shall find (a) that insanitary or unsafe inhabited dwelling accommodations exist in such city or county or (b) that there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations in such city or county available to persons of low income at rentals they can afford.  In determining whether dwelling accommodations are unsafe or insanitary said governing body may take into consideration the degree of overcrowding, the percentage of land coverage, the light, air, space and access available to the inhabitants of such dwelling accommodations, the size and arrangement of the rooms, the sanitary facilities, and the extent to which conditions exist in such buildings which endanger life or property by fire or other causes.  In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of the authority, the authority shall be conclusively deemed to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers hereunder upon proof of the adoption of a resolution by the governing body declaring the need for the authority.  Such resolution or resolutions shall be deemed sufficient if it&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  declares that there is such need for an authority and finds in substantially the foregoing terms (no further detail being necessary) that either or both of the above enumerated conditions exist in the city or county, as the case may be.&quot; This section of the amending act also creates a State Housing Authority Board, which must approve all housing projects undertaken within the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As amended by the act of 1939 (Ga. L. 1939, p. 112), section 10 of the Housing Authorities Law of 1937 provides: &quot;In the operation or management of housing projects an authority shall at all times observe the following duties with respect to rentals and tenant selection: (a) It may rent or lease the dwelling accommodations therein only to persons of low income.  (b) It may rent or lease the dwelling accommodations therein only at rentals within the financial reach of such persons of low income.  (c) It may rent or lease to a tenant dwelling accommodations consisting of the number of rooms (but no greater number) which it deems necessary to provide safe and sanitary accommodations to the proposed occupants thereof, without overcrowding.  (d) It shall not accept any person as a tenant in any housing project&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  if the person or persons who would occupy the dwelling accommodations have an annual net income in excess of five times the annual rental of the quarters to be furnished such person or persons, except that in the case of families with three or more minor dependents such ratio shall not exceed six to one; in computing the rental for this purpose of selecting tenants, there shall be included in the rental the average annual cost (as determined by the authority) to the occupants, of heat, water, electricity, gas, cooking range and other necessary services or facilities whether or not the charge for such services and facilities is in fact included in the rental.  (e) It shall prohibit subletting by tenants.&quot; And by section 6 of the amending act of 1939, it is also provided: &quot;That insofar as the provisions of this Act are inconsistent with the provisions of any other law, the provisions of this Act shall be controlling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During its session of 1937, the General Assembly also enacted a statute known as the &quot;Housing Co-operation Law&quot; (Ga. L. 1937, p. 697).  That act was also amended by the legislature in 1939 (Ga. L. 1939, p. 127), and, as thus amended, section 4 of the act is as follows: &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;For the purpose of aiding and co-operating in the planning, undertaking, construction or operation of housing projects located within the area in which it is authorized to act, any State Public Body may upon such terms, with or without consideration, as it may determine: (a) Dedicate, sell, convey or lease any of its property to a housing authority or the Federal Government; (b) Cause parks, playgrounds, recreational or community facilities, or any other works which it is otherwise empowered to undertake, to be furnished adjacent to or in connection with housing projects; (c) Furnish, dedicate, close, pave, install, grade, regrade, plan or replan streets, roads, roadways, alleys, sidewalks or other places which it is otherwise empowered to undertake; (d) Plan or replan, zone or rezone any part of such State Public Body; make exceptions from building regulations and ordinances; any city or town may also change its map; (e) Cause services to be furnished to a housing authority of the character which such State Public Body is otherwise empowered to furnish; (f) Enter into agreements with respect to the exercise by such State Public Body of its powers relating to the repair, closing, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or demolition of unsafe, insanitary or unfit dwellings; (g) Employ (notwithstanding the provisions of any other law) any funds belonging to or within the control of such State Public Body, including funds derived from the sale or furnishing of property or facilities to a housing authority, in the purchase of the bonds or other obligations of a housing authority; and exercise all the rights of any holder of such bonds or other obligations; (h) Enter into agreements (which may extend over any period, notwithstanding any provision or rule of law to the contrary) with a housing authority or the Federal Government respecting action to be taken by such State Public Body pursuant to any of the powers granted by this Act; and (i) Do any and all things, necessary or convenient to aid and co-operate in the planning, undertaking, construction or operation of such housing projects.  (j) With respect to any housing project which a housing authority has acquired or taken over from the Federal Government and which the housing authority by resolution has found and declared to have been constructed in a manner that will promote the public interest and afford necessary safety, sanitation and other protection, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  no State Public Body shall require any changes to be made in the housing project or the manner of its construction or take any other action relating to such construction.  (k) In connection with any public improvements made by a State Public Body in exercising the powers herein granted, such State Public Body may incur the entire expense thereof.  Any law or statute to the contrary notwithstanding, any sale, conveyance, lease or agreement provided for in this section may be made by a State Public Body without appraisal, public notice, advertisement or public bidding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On its own motion, the governing body of the City of Gainesville, Georgia, on August 15, 1949, found: (a) that insanitary or unsafe inhabited dwelling accommodations existed in that city, and (b) that there was a shortage of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations in the city available to persons of low income at rentals they could afford; and, accordingly, by proper resolution declared the city's immediate need for a housing authority under the terms, conditions, and procedure laid down by the act of 1937, as amended by the act of 1939.  By the same public body the &quot;Housing Authority of the City of Gainesville&quot; was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  activated; and, pursuant to the terms of the Housing Authorities Law, C. B. Romberg, C. G. Butler, J. H. Washington, John W. Jacobs Jr., and Charles L. Hardy were selected and appointed Commissioners of the Housing Authority of the City of Gainesville and James A. Dunlap was subsequently employed as its secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 9, 1950, Harold R. Telford and five others, as citizens and taxpayers of Gainesville, Georgia, brought a suit in the Superior Court of Hall County, Georgia, against the City of Gainesville and, also, against the several named commissioners and James A. Dunlap, the secretary of the Housing Authority of the City of Gainesville, individually, to enjoin them from proceeding further with the construction and development of certain slum-clearance and low-rent housing projects which the Housing Authority of the City of Gainesville had previously initiated for that city.  For reasons which will fully appear and be dealt with in the opinion, the petition, as amended, alleges that the Housing Authority purportedly created, established, and activated for the City of Gainesville is non-existent and, therefore, not a public body corporate and politic; that the defendant commissioners&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the defendant secretary who were appointed and employed, respectively, to function for it as a public body corporate and politic have no legal right or power to do so; and that all action taken and all agreements and contracts made by them as such purported commissioners for and in behalf of the non-existent and illegally activated Housing Authority for the City of Gainesville are null and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides for a rule nisi, order for service, date for hearing, process and general relief, the prayers were: 1. That the purported public body corporate and politic, the so-called Housing Authority of the City of Gainesville, be declared non-existent and, consequently, without legal status.  2. That the Housing Authorities Law of 1937, as amended by the act of 1939, be declared unconstitutional for all of the reasons alleged in the petition as amended.  3. That section 4 of a co-operation agreement, dated December 5, 1949, between the City of Gainesville and the purported, but non-existent, Housing Authority of the City of Gainesville be declared illegal, null and void.  4. That the defendants be temporarily and permanently enjoined from acting under the Housing Authorities Law of 1937&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as amended and the co-operation agreement of December 5, 1949, between the City of Gainesville and the so-called, but non-existent, Housing Authority of the City of Gainesville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants by general demurrer challenged the sufficiency of the amended petition to state a cause of action for any of the relief sought.  At an interlocutory hearing, the trial judge overruled the defendants' demurrer, and held that the Housing Authorities Law of 1937, as amended by the act of 1939, was not unconstitutional for any reason assigned; that section 4 of the co-operation agreement between the City of Gainesville and the Housing Authority of the City of Gainesville, in so far as it requires approval by the Public Housing Administration of any of the undertakings therein contained was illegal and void; and that the plaintiffs were not entitled to temporary injunctive relief, except as to section 4 of the co-operation agreement, and as to that the City of Gainesville was temporarily enjoined &quot;from acting under any of the provisions contained in section 4 of the co-operative agreement, dated December 5, 1949, which require approval of the United States Public Housing Administration.&quot; To all of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the rulings adverse to them the plaintiffs excepted, and by direct bill of exceptions brought their case to this court for review.  The defendants also excepted to the rulings adverse to them and came up by cross-bill of exceptions.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff citizens sought review of an order from the Superior Court of Hall County (Georgia), which determined that the Housing Authorities Law, 1937 Ga. Laws 112 (Law), was not unconstitutional in the citizens' suit against defendants, city and commissioners, seeking to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the construction and development of certain slum-clearance and low-rent housing projects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizens brought suit against defendant seeking to enjoin them from constructing slum-clearance and low-rent housing projects and challenging the Housing Authorities Law (Law). The superior court determined that the Law was not unconstitutional, but also found a section of the co-operation agreement between the housing authority and the city was void because it required approval of its undertakings by the United States Public Housing Administration (PHA). The citizens excepted to the rulings and defendants filed a cross-bill of exceptions. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the citizen's petition failed to state a claim for relief. The court held that the Law was not a violation of the due process clause because notice of and an opportunity for a hearing on the question of a need for activating the housing authority was not required. The court further held that the results accomplished by the Law did not defeat or lessen competition as prohibited by Ga. Const. art. IV, &sect; 4(1). The court found that one section of the co-operation agreement was void because it delegated a non-delegable municipal police power to the PHA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certiorari; from Court of Appeals.  81 Ga. App. 690.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case is one involving unemployment compensation and is before this court on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals.  A complete statement of facts, together with the contentions of the employer and the employees, may be found in Abercrombie v. Ford Motor Co., 81 Ga. App. 690 (59 S. E. 2d, 664), and, for this reason, only those facts pertinent to our decision will be given here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford Motor Company, the employer, was involved in a labor dispute at its assembly plant in Dearborn, Michigan, and the employees at its parts-producing plant, also in Dearborn, went out on strike in sympathy with the assembly employees, which resulted in a work stoppage at its assembly plants throughout the United States.  This work stoppage resulted in unemployment of employees of that company at Hapeville, Georgia, and the main and only question involved is whether or not these employees are eligible for unemployment compensation under the Georgia law.  The claimants for unemployment compensation are members of a local union which holds its charter from the International Union, United Automobile, Aircraft&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, UAW-CIO, the bargaining agent for all the employees of Ford Motor Company throughout the United States.  As such the International Union negotiated and executed the contract of employment for all the employees of the company, including those employed at the Hapeville plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the constitution of the International Union, each member of every local is a member of the International Union and is bound by the provisions of its constitution, and the International Union is constituted the exclusive authorized agent of every employee for the execution and negotiation of employment contracts; adjustment of all working conditions; appearances before boards, courts, committees, or other tribunals in any matter affecting the status of each member as an employee; and the settlement of all grievances, complaints, or disputes arising out of the employer-employee relationship -- all of the above as fully and to all intents and purposes as the employee might or could do if personally present.  The constitution sets forth how the International Union shall be governed; how it shall meet in convention; the number of delegates from each local and how&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  they shall be elected; how its officers shall be elected, their various duties, qualifications, and salaries; and the method of handling all contracts and negotiations.  It sets forth how local unions may be formed, how charters are to be issued, and the internal management of such unions.  Article 42 explains the handling of strikes and how approval must be obtained from the officials of the International Union.  It is here shown that the officials of the International Union must approve a strike, are empowered to order a return to work, and in the event of a refusal may order the charter forfeited.  In certain cases of emergency the officials may call a general strike with a later vote by the membership.  As the exclusive agent of the members and locals, it has complete control of a strike once it is called and may order a return to work at any time.  It also controls the calling of a strike by the fact that it must approve it.  In effect, the International Union, as disclosed by the constitution, is a mere combination of all the locals to form one integrated autonomous organization for the solidification of its employee members to improve their working conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the present&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  case a local union voted a strike in Michigan, which was approved by the International Union, although it resulted in a work stoppage to the entire Ford Motor Company establishment and resulted in widespread unemployment at various Ford assembly plants throughout the country, including the assembly plant at Hapeville, Georgia.  The strike was the result of a labor dispute, growing out of a contention made on the assembly line at the Dearborn plant, which was as essential and as vital to the assembly plant employees at other locations as to those at the Dearborn plant.  Since the parts-producing employees voluntarily left their employment at Dearborn with the consent and approval of the International Union, the result was a work stoppage, within a very short time, at all the assembly plants throughout the United States.  There was evidence submitted to the fact-finding board that the company requested that, since only about 5000 men were directly involved, and the strike by the parts-producing employees resulted in more than 102,000 employees being out of employment, the International Union permit &quot;all Ford workers to return to their jobs, except those in the buildings directly involved.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The union refused and in answer stated: &quot;They [the Ford workers] recognize . . they are all directly affected by the basic principle of whether or not the company shall have the right to speed them up whenever it wants to.&quot; In addition, there was other evidence showing the solidarity of the entire membership in support of the strike.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant employer appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Georgia), which ruled for plaintiff employees in their claim for unemployment compensation benefits. The employees sought the benefits when the Georgia plant went out on strike after the union voted a strike on the employer's plant in Michigan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employees' union voted an approved strike in Michigan and the employees in the employer's Georgia plant also went out on strike as a result. The appellate court held that the employees' claims for unemployment benefits were valid. In the employer's appeal, the court reversed the appellate court's judgment, concluding that the unemployment was neither involuntary nor free from the employees' fault and that it was not compensable. The court ruled that under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 54-610(d) (Supp. 1937), the Georgia plant was not a separate factory, establishment, or other premises because its business was not conducted independently of the employer's main branch in Michigan. However, unemployment compensation was not paid where the unemployment was voluntary or due to the employees' fault. While the employees in Georgia took no act causing their unemployment, they were chargeable with the voluntary acts which brought it about. The union officers were the employees' agents and their actions were expressly authorized by every union member, the principals. The officers were empowered to order a return to work and because they did not, the employees' unemployment here was voluntary.</SPAN></P>

Laws 717 as he had not served 25 years. The trustees had granted the employee a pension in 1942. Upon consideration, the court denied the motion for rehearing. The court held that the trustees' prior decision had already become final and binding upon both parties and was not subject to review by certiorari or any other means. With respect to the employee's eligibility for benefits, the court found that a determination of that issue had already been adjudicated by the trustees in their prior decision, which had become final and binding. The court also determined that prior law had expressly provided that if funds from deductions from salaries and other specific sources of revenue were inadequate for payment of pension benefits that the deficiency would be made up with funds from the city treasury.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the case here in question was called for trial in the Superior Court of McDuffie County, same being a claim case, the plaintiff in error, before answering, filed a written motion to disqualify C. J. Perryman, the judge then presiding, in which it was contended: that he was disqualified to serve as judge in McDuffie County because McDuffie County was in the Augusta Judicial Circuit, and if C. J. Perryman was judge at all, he was judge of the Toombs Judicial Circuit, of which McDuffie County was not a part; that the act of the legislature of 1927 which attempted to transfer McDuffie County from the Augusta Judicial Circuit to the Toombs Judicial Circuit was unconstitutional for reasons alleged; that C. J. Perryman was not eligible to serve at all because he was residing in the Augusta Judicial Circuit (in McDuffie County) in 1948 when he was elected as judge of the Toombs Judicial Circuit; that if C. J. Perryman is judge of the Toombs Judicial Circuit, still, he was not procured by any of the methods provided by law to act and preside in McDuffie County, or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the case then called for trial.  The plaintiff in error offered to prove the facts alleged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge, after reading the motion, overruled it and held as a matter of law that he was qualified, that he was judge of the Superior Court of the Toombs Judicial Circuit, and that McDuffie County was a part of the Toombs Judicial Circuit.  To this ruling, exceptions pendente lite were duly preserved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the evidence, a verdict was directed in favor of the claimant.  A motion for new trial was duly filed and overruled.  The exception is to the judgment denying a new trial, and error is assigned on the exceptions pendente lite.  The only question argued or insisted upon in this court is the exception pendente lite ruling.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff in error sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of McDuffie County (Georgia), which was entered in favor of defendant in error in defendant in error's levy and claim action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant in error brought an action against plaintiff in error in the trial court. Prior to filing an answer, plaintiff in error filed a written motion to disqualify the trial judge, claiming that the trial court was in a judicial circuit in which the trial judge was not authorized to act. The judge denied the motion. Subsequently, judgment was entered in favor of defendant in error. Plaintiff in error's appeal was limited to arguments dealing with the denial of his motion to disqualify the trial judge. The court held that 1927 Ga. Laws 175, which transferred the trial court from one judicial circuit to the trial judge's judicial circuit, was a general law, rather than a special law. The court further found that 1927 Ga. Laws 175 had a clearly stated objective and was not misleading which, coupled with it being a general law, made it constitutional. The court determined that, because the trial court had been considered a part of the trial judge's circuit for a number of years, the trial court had properly interpreted the legislature to include it in the trial judge's circuit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Cade was indicted in Richmond Superior Court for the murder of one J. K. Joe, a Chinese merchant.  The record discloses that this defendant, along with Curtis Wynn, Lincoln Mays, James Smith, and Johnny Hardge, formed and carried out a conspiracy to rob the deceased; that the deceased was a Chinaman about fifty years of age, and under the testimony of the coroner's physician, when his body was found, had been cut across the eyes, face, forehead, and nose, and his nose was broken; that there were numerous lacerations, and the right common carotid artery was severed by a stab wound in the neck, which caused immediate death.  This defendant, in a written, sworn statement, which was admitted in evidence without objection, stated that he cut the deceased with a butcher knife to make him tell where the money was and to make him open his safe; that he called for the butcher knife to finish the deceased up after he had been robbed and tortured, but, in his statement, contended that the stab in the neck was made by Lincoln Mays just before they left the scene of the homicide; that this defendant, Curtis&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Wynn, and Lincoln Mays, left the scene of the homicide and went to a described house, where they divided the money.  There was evidence by one of the State's witnesses that the defendant had stated to him that he killed the Chinaman; that he cut his damn throat, and in his statement to the jury the defendant stated that he handed the butcher knife to Lincoln Mays when he said &quot;he is not dead,&quot; and told Lincoln Mays to finish killing him, and that Lincoln Mays took the knife and cut him.  These statements of the defendant were corroborated in many particulars by other evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the jury had been purged as to relationship by the court, and the solicitor-general had put the usual voir dire questions to the first juror, and then informed the defendant that the juror was on him, counsel for the defendant -- basing his request upon the act approved February 25, 1949 (Ga. L. 1949, p. 1082) -- moved the court that he be allowed to ask each individual juror the following list of questions: &quot;(1) What is your occupation?  (2) What is your religious denomination, are you [sic]?  (3) Do you attend church regularly?  (4) Do you belong to any social or fraternal organizations?  (5) Do you&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  belong to any organizations that Messrs. Hains, Curry, and Kennedy are members of?  (6) Were you still impartial toward the defendant, Charles Cade, after reading the accounts of the crime in the local papers?  (7) What is your age?  (8) Do you still feel unbiased after reading these articles in the Augusta Herald?  (9) Do you do any business or have business with the local Chinese?  (10) Have you any business or social connections with Mr. Curry or Kennedy?  (11) Have you had any business or social connection in the past with Mr. Curry or Kennedy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court made the following ruling: &quot;I overrule your motion for that because that applies to civil cases only and doesn't apply to criminal cases; if it does, the act is unconstitutional because the caption of the act says nothing in regard to criminal cases, nor does that act seek to add to the general questions of the voir dire.&quot; After this ruling the defendant struck the first juror, and to the ruling and judgment of the court the defendant excepted pendente lite and in the only ground of the amendment to the motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty without recommendation.  The defendant filed his motion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for new trial on the usual general grounds, and to the judgment of the trial court overruling his motion for a new trial as amended he excepts, and also assigns error upon his exceptions pendente lite above referred to.  </SPAN></P>

He claimed that it was error to refuse his motion to ask each individual juror several questions during voir dire on the ground that such questions were permissible pursuant to an amendment to O.C.G.A. &sect; 59-705 made by 1949 Ga. Laws 1082.</SPAN></P>

During the voir dire, defense counsel made a motion to be allowed to ask each juror 11 questions on topics from their religion to whether they knew any defendants, which was denied by the trial court on the ground that 1949 Ga. Laws 1082 (the Act) concerning challenges for cause, was unconstitutional as applied to criminal cases because its title made no reference to criminal cases. On review, the court found that statutes were to be construed so as to be consistent with the Georgia Constitution, that no law should contain matter different than that expressed in its title, that the Act repealed O.C.G.A. &sect; 59-705 that referred solely to civil causes, and that O.C.G.A. &sect; 59-806 already provided for broad voir dire in criminal actions. The court found that implementation of the Act would slow down trials and that so much of the Act as purported to apply to criminal case was violative of O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-1908; Ga.

Thus, the trial court had not jurisdiction, that excessive bail was required, and that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court found that the court had jurisdiction despite the legality of the arrest. The court also found that it could not be said that bail was excessive in this case as a matter of law. The court further found that the ordinance did not violate the rule that an ordinance could not legislate on issues already covered by state statutes because the ordinance went further than Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-6501, 6502, by criminalizing the mere possession of lottery tickets.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandamus.  Before Judge Shaw.  Fulton Superior Court.  January 9, 1950.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. J. Bender, a retired member of the Fire Department of the City of Atlanta, petitioned the Fulton Superior Court for the issuance of a writ of mandamus absolute requiring the Board of Trustees of the Firemen's Pension Fund of the City of Atlanta to pay him $ 25 per month from August, 1942, to date, in addition to the $ 75 which he has been paid per month since his retirement in 1942.  His contentions as made by his petition, briefly stated, are as follows: The pension fund was established by the City of Atlanta under the provisions of the act of 1924 (Ga. L. 1924, p. 167); and under this act as amended by the act of 1931 (Ga. L. 1931, p. 223), he, as a member of the fire department, was, after 25 years' service, entitled to retire as a matter of right and receive a monthly pension of $ 100 per month for the remainder of his life.  He became a member of the fire department in 1915, and under the provisions of these acts he was assessed first 1 per centum of his monthly salary and later 2 per centum, which was paid into the pension fund up to the time of his retirement. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 1935 the pension acts were amended (Ga. L. 1935, p. 450), and the amount of pension thereafter to be paid was reduced to $ 75 per month.  In August, 1942, the petitioner made application for retirement and was placed on the pension roll, and since that time he has been paid the sum of $ 75 per month.  In March, 1949, he made application to the defendants for an adjustment in his pension, and demanded that his pension be increased to $ 100 per month, to be retroactively applied to August, 1942.  His application being denied, he then instituted the present proceeding, contending that the act of 1935 as applied to him was unconstitutional and void, as being (a) violative of art. I, sec. X, par. I, of the Constitution of the United States, in that said amendment impaired the obligation of the contract between him and the City of Atlanta whereby the defendants were obligated to pay him $ 100 per month, and that said act was an ex post facto law which attempted retroactively to change, modify, and annul the contract between him and the city; and (b) violative of art. XII, sec. I, par. V, of the Constitution of Georgia of 1877 because said act deprived him of a right granted to him under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the act of 1924, as amended by the act of 1931, by reducing his pension without his knowledge or consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The pensioner was a fireman for the City of Atlanta, Georgia (City) prior to his retirement. When he was hired and began paying into the pension fund, the monthly pension amount was $ 100, pursuant to 1924 Ga. Laws 167 (1924 Act). During the course of his employment, the 1924 Law was amended by 1931 Ga. Laws 223 (1931 Act), which reduced the monthly pension amount to $ 75. Upon his retirement, the pensioner was paid $ 75 a month. On appeal, the court concluded that the superior court erred in sustaining the Board's demurrers and in dismissing the pensioner's petition. The court found that because the pension plan was not gratuitous, but required employee contribution, the plan created a contract between the City and the pensioner. The court concluded that the pensioner had a right under the contract to a pension in the amount of $ 100 and that the 1931 Act constituted an ex post facto law in violation of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; III, para. II. The court held that as the pensioner was a party to the contracted created by the 1924 Act, even though he did not retire until after the 1935 Act was adopted, he had a vested right in the $ 100 per month pension.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Injunction.  Before Judge Mallory C. Atkinson.  Bibb Superior Court.  July 5, 1949.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 25, 1947, L. O. Benton Jr., and Charles J. Haden, as stockholders in the South Western Railroad Company (hereinafter referred to as South Western), brought their action in behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, against the company and its named officers and directors, alleging that the South Western was incorporated by an act of the General Assembly of Georgia approved December 27, 1845, which act and the amendments thereto, accepted by it, constitute its charter; that the original charter of the defendant company was several times amended by the General Assembly of Georgia prior to the General Railroad Incorporation Act of 1892; and that each of these amendments was accepted by the defendant company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is alleged: that no amendment to its charter made any provision as to the sale of its railroad properties, and its charter is silent with respect thereto; that, therefore, the right to sell the entire properties of the company is governed by the general law as it existed at the time of the granting of the charter and the amendments; and that under the general law a majority&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the stockholders are not empowered to sell the properties of the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is further alleged: that the company is a prosperous, going corporation, able to achieve the objects of its incorporation, and neither its officers nor a majority of its stockholders have a right to sell its corporate property or so much thereof as may prevent the continuance of its business as a corporation and the carrying out of the purposes of its formation; that the present capital stock of the defendant company is $ 5,191,100, all of which is represented by common stock; that its properties are free from mortgages or other liens; that it owes no bonded indebtedness; that its current indebtedness on December 31, 1946, was $ 212,610.33, most of which has now been paid, and its current liabilities are less than $ 100,000; that the capital stock is represented by 51,191 shares, and that 50,471 of these shares are outstanding in the hands of the public; that, according to the report of the Board of Directors submitted to the 100th annual convention of stockholders held in Macon, Georgia, on March 13, 1947, its road and equipment property are worth $ 9,523,736.81, and its common stock has a book value&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in excess of $ 180 per share based on fixed assets alone; that in 1942 the Interstate Commerce Commission valued the road and equipment property at $ 12,830,257, and, according to this valuation, its common stock would have a value, based on fixed assets alone, of approximately $ 240 per share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is further alleged that the South Western Company comprises some 340 miles of railroad, bridges, depots, and appurtenances thereto, in the heart of the system of the Central of Georgia Railway; and the petition describes the various railroad lines and branches of the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is further alleged: that, on December 19, 1932, the South Western was being operated by the Central of Georgia Railway Company under a long-term lease, which produced to the South Western a rental sufficient to pay stockholders an annual dividend of five percent, the annual rental being $ 259,550 and taxes and organization expenses; that on that date, in a stated case in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, a receiver of the property and assets of the Central of Georgia Railway Company was appointed, who continued to operate the properties of the Central and of the South Western, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under lease, until June 19, 1940, at which time the Central filed its petition in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Georgia, stating that it was unable to meet its debts as they matured, and that it desired to file a plan of reorganization under the provisions of &sect; 77 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, and thereafter, in conformity with the act, certain persons were appointed trustees; that the trustees thereafter continued to operate the business of that company, subject to the control of the District Court and the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission until Merrel P. Callaway was appointed and confirmed as sole trustee on April 20, 1942; that he has since acted as sole trustee of the Central, and as such has continued to operate the lines of the South Western under lease; that on October 21, 1943, he adopted for the duration of the bankruptcy the South Western lease; that on January 28, 1944, the trustee filed his plan of reorganization with the United States District Court and with the Interstate Commerce Commission, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Act; that, with respect to the South Western, the plan provided: &quot;Prior to or upon consummation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the plan, the debtor [Central of Georgia Railway Company] shall also acquire, if they can be acquired on the terms hereinafter set forth, properties at present leased to the debtor by the South Western Railroad . . . If any of these properties shall not be acquired as a result of the acceptance of the plan by the leased-line security holders, then and in that event the lease or leases of any line or lines not so acquired shall be disaffirmed as of such time at or prior to the consummation of the plan as the court may direct.  The method of acquisition, whether through purchase, merger, or consolidation, shall, subject to the approval of the commission and the court, be determined by the trustee or by the reorganization managers when they begin to function.  If the leased lines are acquired, the railroads of each of the three and the personal property appurtenant thereto and all the real estate owned by each lessor shall be conveyed to the reorganized company; each of said lessors shall waive any damages to which it has become or shall become entitled on account of any breach of lease; and the South Western Railroad Company shall waive all claims in respect to equipment.  Such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conveyances and waivers shall in each instance be the sole consideration of the delivery to each of the respective lessors of the securities proposed to be allocated to it as hereinafter specified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is further alleged: that the securities proposed to be allocated to the holders of the capital stock of the South Western were provided for in the plan as follows: &quot;Holders of South Western Railroad capital stock would receive, for each $ 1000 of stock $ 423.80 in new first-mortgage Series A bonds, and $ 340.97 in new income mortgage Series A [B] bonds&quot; of the proposed reorganized company; that the proposed new first-mortgage bonds would be secured by the first lien, subject as to equipment to the liens of equipment obligations, on all railroads owned by the reorganized company on consummation of the plan, including leaseholds and capital stocks of terminal companies, and also be a similar lien on the stock of the Ocean Steamship Company and certain other securities and property, and the mortgage securing them would contain an appropriate after-acquired-property clause; that the new income mortgage bonds would be secured by a lien, subject to the lien of the first mortgage bond, upon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  all property from time to time subject to the lien of the mortgage; that there would be presently issued, under the plan, $ 14,000,000 of Series A first-mortgage bonds, and $ 16,000,000 of Series B income mortgage bonds; that, of the first-mortgage bonds of the proposed new corporation, there would be issued to South Western approximately $ 2,100,000 thereof, and of the income bonds approximately $ 1,700,000, a total of approximately $ 3,700,000 [$ 3,800,000] of bonds for property worth in excess of $ 9,500,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is further alleged that, almost immediately after the publication of this plan, the stockholders of South Western met in annual meeting at Macon, Georgia, on March 9, 1944, and passed a resolution to the effect &quot;that the terms of the purchases proposed by the trustee are hereby declared to be grossly unfair and inadequate to South Western Railroad and are hereby unhesitatingly rejected,&quot; at which meeting there were represented 27,286 shares of the outstanding capital stock of South Western, all voting unanimously for the adoption of the resolution with the exception of one stockholder who owned 100 shares of stock, which position of the stockholders was reaffirmed at&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the next annual meeting held on March 8, 1945.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is further alleged that the plan of reorganization was approved by the District Court on June 25, 1946, and other allegations are made in the petition with reference to subsequent meetings of directors and stockholders, and other actions taken respecting the offer, which we do not deem it necessary to set out in specific detail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is further alleged that, on March 13, 1947, despite the previous rejection of the plan by the directors and stockholders of South Western, the directors approved the plan, subject to the assent of said acceptance by the holders of a majority of the stock of South Western, and proposed to submit its acceptance to a meeting of the stockholders to be held on March 28, 1947, a letter being sent on March 14, 1947, by the President of South Western to the stockholders, notifying them to this effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is alleged that in this letter the president stated: &quot;Under the laws of Georgia, the assent of a majority of our stockholders is required to a sale or lease of our railroad properties.  Should the stockholders, desire to accept the offer to purchase the physical properties of our company contained in the plan&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of reorganization, such acceptance must be authorized by a vote of a majority of the stockholders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is further alleged that in his reference to the laws of Georgia, the President of South Western was referring to &sect;&sect; 94-328 and 94-329 of the Georgia Code of 1933, copies of which sections are attached to the petition as Exhibit &quot;B&quot;; and it is alleged that these sections are not applicable to the South Western for the reason, among others, that &quot;The sections were not intended by the General Assembly of Georgia to apply to the South Western Railroad Company; were not intended by the legislature to amend the charter of the South Western Railroad Company; and, if so intended, have not been accepted as a part of the charter by the stockholders of the South Western Railroad Company.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is further alleged that, if the said Code &sect;&sect; 94-328 and 94-329 should be construed by the court to be applicable to the present situation of the South Western, and the previous actions by its directors, they could not regulate and govern a sale of the properties of South Western, as they would be unconstitutional and void as being in violation of article I, section X, paragraph I of the Constitution of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the United States (Code &sect; 1-134), which provides: &quot;No State shall . . pass any . . law impairing the obligation of contracts,&quot; and of article I, section III, paragraph II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-302), which provides: &quot;No . . law impairing the obligation of contracts . . shall be passed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is further alleged that the charter granted to the South Western by the General Assembly of Georgia, and accepted by it, is a contract between the State of Georgia and the South Western Railroad Company, and its stockholders, the benefits of which inure to the stockholders, including the plaintiffs, and the obligation of which cannot be impaired by the sections of the Code above referred to, or any other act of the General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs pray: (a) For process; (b) that the defendant officers and directors of the South Western Railroad Company be restrained and enjoined from holding a stockholders' meeting on March 28, 1947, and from submitting to such meeting the proposed plan to sell the railroad properties of the South Western Railroad Company; (c) that, if the court should not restrain and enjoin the holding of the stockholders' meeting, as herein&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prayed, and if at that meeting a mere majority of the stockholders should vote in favor of the acceptance of the plan and the resulting sale of all the railroad properties of the defendant corporation, the officers and directors of the defendant company be restrained and enjoined from carrying such action of the stockholders into effect; and specifically that the officers and directors be restrained and enjoined from filing with the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Georgia, or with the Interstate Commerce Commission, any acceptance of the plan, and that the officers and directors of the defendant company be specifically restrained and enjoined from selling to the reorganized company, or to any one else, or any other company, all the defendant company's railroad properties, rights, and franchises, and be specifically restrained and enjoined from executing any written instrument which might convey the fee-simple title to the property just mentioned unto the reorganized company or any other company; and be specifically restrained and enjoined from doing and performing any act in behalf of the South Western Railroad Company which might tend to consummate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the plan of reorganization of Central of Georgia Railway Company with respect to the acquisition of the properties of the South Western Railroad Company; and (d) for such other and further relief as to the court may seem meet and proper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently this petition was amended by striking Charles J. Haden as party plaintiff at his request, and certain other persons, to wit, Dr. W. G. Lee, I. L. Domingos, Gordon S. Chapman, J. P. Illges Jr., and Charles Loridans, were permitted to intervene as parties plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this petition the defendants filed an answer, in which they admitted certain allegations and denied others.  It was admitted that the South Western was chartered by the act of the General Assembly of 1845, as alleged in the petition, and it was alleged that this charter had several times been amended, and that these amendments had been accepted by the company; and that, in its original charter as so amended, there is no provision with respect to the sale of its railroad properties.  But the defendants deny that the right to sell the entire physical property of the company is governed by the general law as it existed at the time of the grant of its original charter and the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  amendments thereto; and say, on the contrary, that the right to sell its physical properties is expressly authorized by the act of the General Assembly of Georgia of 1933 (Code, &sect;&sect; 94-328, 94-329) upon the assent to said sale by a majority of its stockholders.  The answer makes further allegations with reference to the act of the board of directors in recommending to the stockholders the acceptance of the offer under the plan of reorganization because of the limits of time fixed by the Interstate Commerce Commission within which the South Western must vote to either accept or reject the plan, under the penalty of being deprived of its right to either accept or reject the plan, and the reasons why the board of directors had changed its position and recommended acceptance.  The defendants deny that the charter of the South Western and the amendments thereto constitute such a contract between the South Western and its stockholders as to require the unanimous vote of the stockholders to effect a sale of its properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is alleged by the defendants' answer that, when Central of Georgia Railway Company, successor in title to Central Railroad &amp; Banking Company of Georgia, went into receivership&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in December, 1932, it was then operating under lease three different railroads, naming them, including the South Western; that the General Assembly of Georgia -- knowing that, under the general railroad laws of this State as they existed at the time of the receivership of the Central in December, 1932, the leased lines of the Central could not lease or sell their properties by reason of the fact that the General Railroad Law, as codified in &sect;&sect; 94-303 and 94-318 of the Code, did not apply to them -- passed an act in 1933, codified as &sect; 94-328 of the Code, authorizing any railroad corporation organized under the laws of Georgia, which had theretofore leased its properties for a long term of years to another corporation, which lease had terminated and the lessor was not a going concern or equipped to continue the operation of a railroad company, to sell or lease its properties, rights, and franchises to another railroad company upon such terms as may be agreed upon by the board of directors of the selling or lessor corporation and assented to by the holders of a majority of its stock; that the act of 1933 was not forced upon the South Western against its will or the will of its stockholders, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and in no sense impaired the obligation of the contract between South Western and the State of Georgia; that, on the contrary, this act was adopted by the General Assembly for the benefit of all leased lines in this State coming within the provisions of the act; and that South Western came within its provisions.  This answer was filed on April 19, 1947.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 24, 1947, and after the issuance by the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Georgia of an injunctive process enjoining the petitioners from prosecuting their action in the State courts, the trial court granted a temporary injunction restraining the defendants as prayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this order and judgment the defendants duly excepted pendente lite, and error is assigned thereon in the main bill of exceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, Central of Georgia Railway Company and Merrel P. Callaway, as trustee of its property, filed their intervention by permission of the court, subject to demurrer, and alleged that the plan of reorganization of the Central as promulgated by the Interstate Commerce Commission was approved by the United States District Court on June 24, 1946, and by order of the United States District Court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it was provided that the plan of reorganization be consummated at a stated hour on July 1, 1948; and that the plan was so consummated.  This intervention set out certain provisions of the plan of reorganization with reference to the acquisition of the properties of the South Western.  It was alleged: that the South Western not only had power to sell its property, rights, and franchises to another railroad corporation, upon such terms as may be agreed upon by the board of directors, and assented to by holders of a majority of its stock under the provisions of the act of the General Assembly of Georgia, approved March 10, 1933 (Code &sect;&sect; 94-328, 94-329), but also under the General Railroad Law of 1892 (Code &sect;&sect; 94-311, 94-318); that at common law a private corporation has power to sell its property in order to liquidate the business, on the vote of a majority of its stock; and that the legislature having sanctioned a sale of the property of South Western, it has the same power to sell as a private corporation.  It is alleged that the Code sections referred to do not in any sense impair the obligation of the contract between the stockholders of the South Western; that, even if these Code&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sections, which are general laws of the State and do not impair any vested right of the stockholders of the South Western, should be held to be amendments of the charter, they are not fundamental and do not affect the object or purposes for which the corporation was created, and do not affect any rights of stockholders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intervention makes various other allegations with reference to the condition of South Western, its alleged inability to operate as a railroad company, the cost of equipping it to operate as such; and alleges that, in the exigencies which confront the South Western, it would have the power to sell its property on a majority vote of its stockholders, even though it had no express power in its charter to sell, especially in view of the fact that the State, by the Code sections above referred to, has evidenced its consent to the sale upon a vote of a majority of the stock of the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intervenors prayed: that the court decree that South Western has power to accept the offer made to it in the plan of reorganization of Central, by a vote of a majority of its stock, that the acceptance by South Western on such vote is valid and binding, and that South Western&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  may convey its property to Central in consummation of its acceptance; and that the court decree, in the exigencies in which South Western finds itself, that it has power to convey its property to Central on a vote of the majority of the stock; and for general relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, both South Western and its officers and Central and its trustee amended their answer and intervention, respectively, making the allegations and seeking the relief referred to in the second division of the opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are other allegations in the amendments to the plaintiffs' petition to the effect that, even if a sale could be authorized by a majority vote of stockholders, the transaction here involved does not amount to a sale, but it is a mere exchange of properties, which is not authorized by the charter of South Western or by the Code sections relied upon by the defendants and intervenors; and that, even if the transaction be declared a sale, the consideration therefor is grossly inadequate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were also other amendments to the answer and intervention, in which it was alleged that the question of adequacy of consideration was res adjudicata under the decisions of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and of the United State Supreme Court in the litigation between these parties in those courts; but, in the view we take of the case, we do not deem it necessary to set out in detail these contentions of the parties as contained in their pleadings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the plaintiffs' petition the defendants and intervenors interposed various general and special demurrers, all of which were overruled by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the answer and the intervention as amended the plaintiffs interposed many general and special demurrers, the general demurrers being to the effect that neither the answer nor the intervention as amended set up any defenses to the plaintiffs' petition.  These demurrers were sustained, and a final decree was entered on the pleadings as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(1) It appears to the court that Dr. W. G. Lee, I. L. Domingos, Gordon S. Chapman, J. P. Illges Jr., and Charles Loridans, individually, and as members of the Stockholders Protective Committee of the South Western Railroad Company have intervened herein as parties plaintiff, and that Charles J. Haden has been stricken as a party plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(2) The plaintiff and plaintiffs-intervenors have moved the court for a judgment or decree in their&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  favor on the pleadings in the cause.  It is now considered, adjudged, and decreed:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(a) That the said motion be granted, and the defendants enjoined as prayed;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(b) That the officers and directors of South Western Railroad Company be permanently enjoined from carrying into effect the action of the stockholders of South Western Railroad Company taken at the meeting of March 28, 1947;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(c) That the officers and directors of South Western Railroad Company be permanently enjoined from transferring or conveying to the reorganized Central of Georgia Railway Company, or to anyone else, or any other company, all the defendant company's railroad properties, rights, and franchises based on the aforesaid action of the stockholders;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(d) That the officers and directors of the defendant company be permanently enjoined from executing any written instrument which might convey the fee-simple title to the properties just mentioned unto the reorganized company, or any other company, based on a mere majority vote of the stockholders of the defendant company;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(e) That the officers and directors of the defendant company be permanently enjoined from doing and performing any act in behalf of South&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Western Railroad Company which might tend to consummate the plan of reorganization of Central of Georgia Railway Company with respect to the acquisition of the properties of the South Western Railroad Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is further considered, ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the costs of this proceeding, to be taxed by the Clerk, be assessed against the defendants herein.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the judgments on the demurrers proper exceptions pendente lite were filed by both the defendants and the intervenors, and error is assigned thereon in the main bill of exceptions, and exception is also taken to the final decree.  We do not deem it necessary to set out in detail the various grounds of demurrer which are not ruled upon because of the direction given to the case in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, railway corporation, officers, and directors, appealed the judgment of the trial court (Georgia), which granted an injunction in favor of plaintiff stockholders, holding that the railway corporation's charter contained no authority for the corporation to sell its property without the full consent of the stockholders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The stockholders brought an action against the railway corporation and its officers and directors, seeking to prevent the sale and reorganization of the corporation. The stockholders contended that a majority of the stockholders were not empowered to sell the properties of the railway corporation because the railway corporation's charter was silent, and the general law at the time of the railway corporation's incorporation required an unanimous consent of the stockholders. The charter of the railway corporation was granted by the state under the Georgia Code of 1863 and was limited. After several legislative amendments, the charter contained no specific authority to sell its franchise or property. The court held that the powers of a corporation organized under a legislative charter were only such as the statute conferred. The U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and the Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, para. 2 provided that no state could pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts. Thus, the court concluded that the stockholders had a right to stand on their contract. The stockholders could not be forced into an enterprise that was not included in the charter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's intervention to enjoin the railway corporation and its officers and directors from selling the corporation's property without the full consent of the stockholders or legislative mandate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STATEMENT OF FACTS BY DUCKWORTH, CHIEF JUSTICE.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnny Glustrom was charged in the Criminal Court of Fulton County &quot;with the offense of misdemeanor, for that the said Johnny Glustrom in the county aforesaid on the 17th day of April, 1949 did transport distilled spirits in violation of regulation 602 of the Commissioner of Revenue of the State of Georgia.&quot; Regulation 602 is set out in the accusation in full.  In so far as material in the present case, the regulation provides: &quot;A wholesaler or a retailer shall transport distilled spirits only in a motor vehicle registered in his name with the Commissioner and bearing his name, all his license numbers under the Act, and the addresses of all his places thereof in prominent letters in the English language, and only between sun-up and sun-down on a week-day, and only if each such shipment is accompanied by an invoice or itemized list thereof showing in detail the number of cases, the size of containers, type, brand and price of the distilled spirits included in such shipment, and the point of origin and the point of destination thereof.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is alleged in the accusation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that &quot;the said Johnny Glustrom, a licensed retail liquor dealer, being licensed to sell distilled spirits under a license issued by the Commissioner of Revenue of the State of Georgia pursuant to an Act known as the Revenue Tax Act to legalize and control alcoholic beverages and liquors and the rules and regulations promulgated under the provisions of said Act, did transport 2 cases of whisky [containing 24 bottles of named brands of whisky].  Said distilled spirits were transported by Johnny Glustrom, a retailer, in a motor vehicle which was not registered in his name and with the Commissioner, and bearing his name, or his license number under the Act, and addresses of all his places of business were not painted prominently and displayed on at least two sides thereof in prominent letters of the English language, and said shipment was not accompanied by an invoice or itemized listing thereof showing in detail the number of cases, size of containers, type, brand and price of distilled spirits included in such shipment, and the point of origin, and the point of destination thereof, all are required by said regulation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant demurred to the accusation on the ground that there&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is no valid law in the State making it a misdemeanor to violate Rule 602, promulgated by the State Revenue Commissioner.  It is contended that the only statute purporting to make the violation of such rules a misdemeanor is section 20 of the act known as the &quot;Revenue Tax Act to Legalize and Control Alcoholic Beverages and Liquors&quot; (Ga. L. 1937-38, pp. 103, 121, Code, Ann. Supp., &sect; 58-1069).  It is insisted that, in so far as such act seeks to make a violation of the rules of the State Revenue Commissioner a misdemeanor, the act is unconstitutional and void, being an unlawful, unwarranted, and unconstitutional attempt on the part of the General Assembly to delegate to an administrative official authority to define a crime, in violation of the following provisions of the Constitution of 1945: &quot;The legislative, judicial and executive powers shall forever remain separate and distinct, and no person discharging the duties of one, shall, at the same time, exercise the functions of either of the others, except as herein provided.&quot; Art. 1, sec. 1, par. 23 (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-123).  &quot;The legislative power of the State shall be vested in a General Assembly which shall consist of a Senate and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  House of Representatives.&quot; Art. 3, sec. 1, par. 1 (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-1301.  &quot;No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, except by due process of law.&quot; Art. 1, sec. 1, par. 3 (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-103).  The section is further attacked as being in conflict with the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  It is further contended that the section is unconstitutional, in that it fails to fix or establish any standard, or define any limits, within which the commissioner must act in promulgating rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant's demurrer was overruled, and he was found guilty.  He was sentenced to pay a fine of $ 500, including costs, and sentenced to serve twelve months on the public works, the sentence for service on the public works to be suspended on payment of the fine.  His petition for certiorari to the Superior Court of Fulton County was sanctioned and, upon hearing, was overruled.  The exception is to that judgment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petition for injunction.  Before Judge Byars.  Fayette Superior Court.  August 26, 1949.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capitol Distributing Company and numerous others, as plaintiffs, brought their equitable petition against Charles D. Redwine, alleging that he is Revenue Commissioner of Georgia and a resident of Fayette County.  It seeks to enjoin him from making further threats and attempts to levy and collect taxes under an act of the General Assembly, approved July 30, 1949, asserted to be unconstitutional on grounds and as to provisions which will be more particularly pointed out in the opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original petition was demurred to by the defendant on grounds as follows: that no facts were set out such as would constitute a cause of action or would warrant the equitable relief prayed or other equitable relief; and that there was no equity in the bill, because the facts show that the plaintiffs have a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law.  Under three separate amendments the plaintiffs amplified the allegations of the petition.  The third amendment, among other things, added three exhibits and amended paragraph 14 of the petition to read as follows: &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The said 1949 amendment to the wine laws was added to House Bill Number 1, of the 1949 Extraordinary Session of the legislature, as an amendment thereto, by adding an additional paragraph numbered 2A, which contained the amendment to the wine laws, in which form the bill was read, voted on, and passed.  Said act, as read before the legislature and voted on by said legislature, differs from the act approved and signed by the Governor, in that the words 'to increase the excise taxes upon the domestic wines, foreign wines, and domestic and foreign fortified wines' before the final words, 'and for other purposes,' were not in the caption while the act was before the legislature.  Photostatic copies of the original act and its caption and pertinent amendments thereto, certified by the Secretary of State and designated Exhibits 'D', 'E', and 'F', are attached to the petition and hereby made a part of this paragraph by reference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant renewed his demurrers to the original petition and urged additional demurrers to paragraph 14 as amended and the three said exhibits, for the reason that it contains only matter which is surplusage, irrelevant, immaterial, and illustrates no issue; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and that the facts and things set out by way of amendment to paragraph 14 and exhibits &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, and &quot;F&quot; may not properly be proven by evidence, as it must be conclusively presumed that the bill as transmitted to the Governor, approved by him, and enrolled by the Secretary of State truly represents the action of the legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hearing argument on the demurrers to paragraph 14 as amended, including the three named exhibits attached and referred to, the presiding judge entered the following order: &quot;After hearing, it is ordered that the foregoing special demurrer be and the same is hereby overruled.&quot; The defendant thereupon filed exceptions pendente lite, and the same are the subject of the cross-bill in case No. 16901.  The general demurrers to the petition as amended were sustained and the suit was dismissed.  On exceptions to that order and judgment the main case, number 16887, is now before this court.  Attached to the original petition is a copy of the act in dispute, which reads: &quot;1949 Extra Session: Act No. 1 (House Bill No. 1).  An Act To amend an Act approved March 23, 1935, entitled 'An Act to provide for license and excise taxes upon the business of dealing in malt&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  beverages; to allocate funds derived from such taxes; to provide for the enforcement of this Act; to repeal laws in conflict with this Act; to provide for the holding of an election to ratify or reject this Act; and for other purposes,' as amended by the Act approved March 30, 1937, appearing in printed Georgia Laws 1937, pages 148 to 154 inclusive, and as further amended by Act approved December 13, 1937, appearing in Georgia Laws, Extra Session 1937-1938, pages 173 and 174, and as further amended by Act approved March 24, 1939, appearing in Georgia Laws 1939, pages 101 to 103 inclusive, by striking the figures '$ 4.50' in line three, section five, as amended by the Act approved March 24, 1939, and inserting in lieu thereof the figures '$ 9.00', and by striking the word 'two' in line twelve, said section as amended, and inserting in lieu thereof the word 'four'; providing the period for which this amendment shall remain in force; to increase the excise taxes upon domestic wines, foreign wines, and domestic and foreign fortified wines, and for other purposes.</SPAN></P>

The court could not consider the grounds of discrimination and unconstitutionality, which were raised by the taxpayers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation sought a declaration that its stock was exempt from Georgia ad valorem taxation pursuant to Ga. Const. art. 7, &sect; 1 and O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 92-130, 2-5404. The court affirmed the superior court's judgment in the corporation's favor and found that the corporation, as a domesticated foreign corporation, was entitled to the same exemption that a domestic corporation enjoyed under those constitutional and statutory provisions. As a domesticated foreign corporation, the corporation effectively was a resident of Georgia, was entitled to equal protection pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-102, and was entitled under O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-5403 to be taxed in the same manner as a similarly situated domestic corporation. The court rejected the Commissioner's argument that the desired exemption was unconstitutional on the ground that it was not enumerated specifically as an exemption. To construe the constitutional exemption as to confine its application to property owned by a domestic corporation, and to deny its application to the same class or species of property when owned by a domesticated foreign corporation would have offended O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 2-5403, 2-102, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Petition for injunction.  Before Judge Crow.  Grady Superior Court.  July 21, 1949.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a suit by Moultrie Milk Shed Inc., against the City of Cairo, its Mayor and Council, and the Chief of Police, seeking an injunction to prevent the defendants from enforcing a city ordinance which prohibits the sale of milk within the city limits unless it has been pasteurized in a plant located in Grady County, which is the county in which the City of Cairo is located.  The main contention of the petitioner was that the ordinance was void: first, because there had not been conformity with the requirements of the charter in the process of its adoption; and second, because it was arbitrary, discriminatory, unreasonable, and offended the equal-protection clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioner alleged: that the ordinance was not intended as a health measure, and did not by its terms afford protection to the public health, but that its sole purpose and effect was to create a trade barrier for the benefit of a named concern, which has the only pasteurizing plant located in Grady County; that pasteurization and distribution of milk is regulated and controlled by State law, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with which the petitioner had fully complied; that the petitioner sells only the highest quality of pure, wholesome, and pasteurized milk to all of its customers, many of whom reside in the City of Cairo; that the process of pasteurization is for the purpose of freeing milk from any contamination, and the distance from the pasteurizing plant to the point of consumption is immaterial; that the petitioner's plant and milk are regularly and properly inspected by competent inspectors, and laboratory tests are made by State officials from samples taken by the inspectors and sent to the State laboratory; and that the inspection of all milk in the State is by the above process.  It was further alleged: that the city had, after a hearing, canceled the petitioner's license to sell milk in the City of Cairo because it did not have a pasteurizing plant in Grady County as required by the ordinance; that the city authorities had made one criminal case against the petitioner's agent; that the petitioner excepted in due form, is prosecuting a review by certiorari, and has complied with the law in procuring a supersedeas in each case; but the defendants have informed the petitioner that, notwithstanding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such supersedeas, it is their purpose and intention to arrest and prosecute the petitioner and any of its employees and agents who attempt to sell and deliver any milk in the City of Cairo.  This allegation is admitted in the answer of the defendants to be true.  There were further allegations that, because of such express intention of the defendants, the petitioner is unable to get any employees who are willing to sell or deliver the petitioner's milk within the city; that, as a result thereof, the petitioner is sustaining losses and is threatened with the complete destruction of its business in the City of Cairo; that the petitioner purchases its milk from producers under contracts which require it to take delivery, and unless the petitioner can deliver to its customers in Cairo, it will have a large quantity of milk that it will be unable to dispose of, which will deteriorate and become a total loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the interlocutory hearing there was evidence introduced showing the material facts alleged in the petition; these facts were not disputed.  At the conclusion of the hearing the presiding judge, in rendering judgment, recited in the order that, in his opinion, the ordinance in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  question was unconstitutional and void; but that its validity had been raised in the hearings before the city authorities, where it was held valid, and, since these rulings were being brought under review by the writ of certiorari, which was the proper remedy, that it be ordered and adjudged that the prayer for an interlocutory injunction be denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exception here is to that judgment.  Errors are also assigned upon rulings made during the hearing excluding evidence offered by the petitioner which tended to show the motive and purpose of the city council in adopting the ordinance.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city passed an ordinance that no milk could be sold that was not processed in the county where the city was located. The dairy sought an injunction to prohibit the enforcement of the ordinance. The trial court refused to grant the relief requested by the dairy. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that it was alleged and admitted that the city threatened prosecution of all employees and agents of the dairy for each and every sale or delivery of milk made within the city. There was also an allegation that, because of this expressed intention, the dairy was unable to secure the necessary employees for the operation of its business. The court held that this evidence amounted to a plain case of injury to property. The court further held that, although a city was given express authority by its charter to adopt ordinances to protect the public health, it could not demand that a company that was engaged in a lawful business injurious to no one be arbitrarily prevented from carrying on a lawful business. The location of the dairy did not have any relationship to the health and safety of the milk it produced. The ordinance was therefore void.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roy Leathers, as Solicitor-General of the Stone Mountain Circuit, brought his petition in the Superior Court of Clayton County, Georgia, against J. T. Copeland, alleging in substance: that the defendant is the owner and operator of a certain tourist camp and cabin camp, restaurant and cafe, and dancing place, known as Silver Slipper, located on Highway 42 outside the limits of any city or town in the County of Clayton; that the said place of business is being operated, and business at said place is being carried on by the defendant himself, and through his agents, servants, and employees; that the business engaged in by the defendant is that of renting cabins to guests and other persons for lodging, and serving food and drinks to be consumed upon the premises; that the defendant by himself and through his agents, servants, and employees who have had charge of the register kept at said place for the registering of guests and other persons occupying the cabin camps and tourist camps, have knowingly written or have knowingly permitted to be written incorrect license&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  numbers of the automobiles transporting such persons and guests as have occupied said tourist camps and cabin camps, and have failed to write or cause to be written the true and correct license number of motor vehicles transporting the guests and other persons to said place for the purpose of occupying said tourist camps and cabin camps; and that the defendant by himself and through his agents, servants, and employees, has knowingly failed to write or cause to be written, in and upon the register kept at said place of business for the registration of guests and other persons occupying said cabins, the true and correct name of the manufacturer of said motor vehicle used in transporting the guests and other persons registering as guests and occupying cabins at said place of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition prayed: (a) that process issue; (b) that the defendant be served with a copy of the petition and order; (c) that the defendant be temporarily enjoined from conducting and carrying on the business at the place alleged, either by himself or indirectly through his agents, servants, and employees; (d) that a hearing be had; (e) that upon the hearing the defendant be permanently enjoined from conducting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and carrying on the business as alleged; and (f) for other and further relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this petition the defendant filed two demurrers, but the only grounds of demurrer argued and insisted upon by counsel for the plaintiff in error in their briefs are the general grounds numbered 1 in both demurrers and ground 2 of the second demurrer, which grounds were: (1) that the petition sets out no cause of action; (2) the plaintiff's petition fails to set forth a legal cause of action cognizable either in law or equity against the defendant; and (3) that the statute upon which said proceeding and petition is based is unconstitutional and void, for that said statute contains subject-matter different from that which is expressed in the title thereof, in violation of the Constitution of Georgia (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-1908), which provides: &quot;No law shall pass which refers to more than one subject matter, or contains matter different from what is expressed in the title thereof,&quot; in that there is nothing in the title to said act with reference to providing penalties other than against persons who operate such establishments for immoral purposes, or who violate other provisions of said act in the operation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of restaurants, cafes, or places where food and/or drinks are sold; that no reference is made in said title to any other penalties, and particularly to the section undertaking to provide for the issuance of an injunction against persons operating an establishment such as is herein attempted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court overruled the defendant's demurrers, and to this judgment the defendant excepts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant by his answer admitted that he was the owner and operator of the tourist camp and cabin camp, restaurant and cafe, and dance place, known as Silver Slipper, located on Highway 42 outside the limits of any city or town in the County of Clayton; that the place of business was being operated by the defendant by himself and through his agents, servants, and employees; and that the business engaged in was that of renting cabins to guests and other persons for lodging, and serving food and drinks to be consumed upon the premises.  All other allegations of the petition were denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the hearing two members of a former grand jury of Clayton County were sworn as witnesses and testified that they, in company with a named county police officer, went to the place of business of the defendant, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and secured from him his registration records in the form of cards upon which guests had registered.  It was stipulated that these records were secured from the defendant without any subpoena or search warrant, and that, upon demand for his registration record, the cards were delivered to them by the defendant, and that they were the original cards from the place of business of the defendant known as Silver Slipper.  The plaintiff solicitor-general testified: that he had 2400 of the cards which were turned over to him by the grand jurors who secured them from the Silver Slipper; that he had examined all of the 2400 cards; that none of them had entered thereon the name of the manufacturer or make of the automobile; and that 225 of the registration cards have no letters thereon from the license plates or tags of the automobiles, but have only numbers thereon, without giving any information as to what initial the tag or license plate bore, and what State the tag or license plate was from.  Ten of the cards were admitted in evidence, over the objection of counsel for defendant, the grounds of which objection will be referred to in the opinion.  This witness testified that the 10 cards&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  offered were similar to the 2400 other cards, with the exception that some of them do have a number, but that none of them has the make or name of the manufacturer of the automobile that brought the passengers to the place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant offered no evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court took the case under consideration and thereafter entered the following order and judgment: &quot;Restraining Order: After consideration it is ordered and adjudged that the restraining orders heretofore granted be, and are, continued in force and effect, and defendants are restrained from operating, renting, selling, or otherwise conducting tourist cabins commercially or for public use.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the judgment overruling the objections to the admission of the registration cards and admitting them in evidence, and to the judgment granting a restraining order, the defendant also excepted.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff Solicitor-General of the Stone Mountain Circuit petitioned the Superior Court of Clayton County (Georgia) to enjoin defendant business from continuing to operate a tourist and cabin camp because of prior violations of 1945 Ga. Laws 326. The trial court overruled the demurrers of the business. The trial court restrained the business from operating, selling, or otherwise conducting public tourist cabins. The business appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Solicitor-General alleged that the business violated 1945 Ga. Laws 326 by failing to require resort guests to provide correct vehicle identification and license plate numbers. The business alleged that 1945 Ga. Laws 326 violated the Georgia Constitution, O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-1908, that limited a statute to one subject matter. The court held that the 1945 Ga. Laws 326 was constitutional and enforceable. The purpose of the act was the regulation of tourist camps and to provide penalties for violating certain statutory provisions. The business alleged that the trial court erred in admitting guest registrations into evidence that had been supplied to the Solicitor General's office by the business. The court held that the registrations were properly admitted into evidence and substantiated that the business routinely failed to enforce the statutory provisions for a complete registration of the guests and the complete vehicle information for every guest. The court held that the business was bound by the acts of its agents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment, but directed the trial court to modify the order to eliminate the restraint as to the sale of the property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Collins was indicted by the grand jury of Stephens County, Georgia, for an alleged violation of the act of 1941 (Ga. L. 1941, p. 480; Code, Ann. Supp., &sect; 26-2812), which declares that it shall be a felony for any person, with the intent to defraud, to use the proceeds of any payment made to him on account of improving real property, for any other purpose than to pay for labor or service performed on, or materials furnished by his order for the specific improvement, while any amount for which he may be or become liable for such labor, services, or materials remains unpaid.  The last sentence of the act is as follows: &quot;A failure to pay for the material or labor so furnished shall be prima facie evidence of intent to defraud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant interposed to the indictment a general demurrer, in which he attacked the constitutionality of the act on three grounds: (a) It violates art. 3, sec. 7, par. 8 of the Constitution of Georgia (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-1908), in that it refers to more than one subject-matter, and contains matter different from what is expressed in the title thereof.

Defendant claimed that the last sentence of the statute was a different subject matter not included in the title of the statute. The court found that provisions not referred to in the title of the statute could have been constitutionally enacted so long as they were germane to the general subject matter of the statute and designed to carry into effect the purposes for which it was passed. The court determined that the last sentence of &sect; 26-2812 carried into effect the purpose of the statute by declaring what constituted an &quot;intent to defraud.&quot; The court noted that the intent to defraud was an essential element of the crime. The court concluded that the statute did not violate the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt because it was enacted for the purpose of punishing fraudulent conversion and not for punishing a failure to comply with a contractual obligation.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two named persons describing themselves as practicing dentists or doctors of dental surgery in Georgia, five named persons describing themselves as practicing licensed dental hygienists with school or college training therefor, one person describing herself as an applicant for examination and license as a Dental Hygienist and as a graduate of a school or college approved by the Board of Dental Examiners of Georgia, and the Georgia Dental Hygienists Association, alleging itself to be a corporation duly organized for the betterment of the profession, and all alleging themselves to be citizens and taxpayers of the State of Georgia, as petitioners, brought their petition in the Superior Court of Bibb County against seven named defendants as individuals and as members of the State Board of Dental Examiners of Georgia, and another named defendant as Secretary of said Board by virtue of being Joint Secretary of the State Examining Boards of the State of Georgia, seeking to restrain and enjoin the defendants from holding any examination or granting any licenses to dental hygienists under the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provisions of the act of the General Assembly of Georgia approved February 25, 1949 (Ga. L. 1949, p. 1192), upon the grounds and for the reasons that said act is alleged to be unconstitutional and void as violative of the following provisions of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States (Code, Ann., &sect; 1-815): &quot;nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws&quot;; and of article 1, section 1, paragraph 3 of the Constitution of the State of Georgia (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-103), which provides: &quot;No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, except by due process of law&quot;; and of article 1, section 1, paragraph 2 of the Constitution of the State of Georgia (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-102), which provides: &quot;Protection to person and property is the paramount duty of government, and shall be impartial and complete&quot;; and of article 3, section 7, paragraph 8 of the Constitution of the State of Georgia (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-1908), which provides: &quot;No law shall pass which refers to more than one subject-matter, or contains matter different&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from what is expressed in the title thereof.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is alleged in the petition and insisted in the briefs of counsel for the plaintiffs in error: that sections 1 and 3 of said act are wholly irreconcilable, conflicting, discriminatory, ambiguous, and unenforcible, and have the effect of rendering the whole of said act discriminatory, illegal, void, and unconstitutional, as depriving the petitioners of their constitutional rights in violation of constitutional provisions above referred to; that &quot;section 3 of said act by its terms refers to and is predicated upon provisions of section 1 of said act, as if section 84-1009 of the Code of Georgia of 1933, relating to definitions and qualifications for Dental Hygienists still existed as a law, when by the terms of section 1 of said act said Code &sect; 84-1009 was purported to be repealed&quot;; and that section 3 of said act within itself attempts to provide an alternate method of examination for licensing of dental hygienists, one method for those who have graduated from a school or college recognized by the Board of Dental Examiners, and another method for candidates for dental hygienists who have not had such school or college training, but who&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  may have been employed by and performed certain duties for licensed dentists; but that said section is rendered ineffective, unenforcible, discriminatory, and unconstitutional, because section 3 is mistakenly based on the premise that either &sect; 84-1009 of the Code is still in existence as the law or that some other provisions in the act re-enact definitions, qualifications, and standards for dental hygienists, and the examination of and licenses for such persons, when there is an absence of such provisions in any other portion of said act; that, if said act is allowed to stand, it would penalize and discriminate against dental hygienists, already licensed, who are graduates of a school or college recognized by the Board of Dental Examiners, and candidates for licenses, who are such graduates, because it would require college-trained applicants to take both a theoretical and practical examination, whereas office-trained applicants would only be required to take a practical examination, thus being discriminatory, not only as to candidates for licenses, but also allowing into the profession untrained, inefficient, and hazardous persons with the same rights and privileges as those who&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are qualified by school or college training; and, for the same reasons would deprive the petitioners of property without due process of law, and deny to the petitioners the equal protection of laws as guaranteed in the constitutional provisions referred to.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J. P.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer of the defendants averred among other things that they were county officers, that their salaries were fixed by the act in question in compliance with a designated provision of the Georgia Constitution of 1945; and prayed that the act be declared to be of full force and effect, and that the petitioners be ordered and directed to pay to the defendants all sums fixed as compensation by the said act &quot;which have become due or might hereafter become due.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Injunction.  Before Judge Hendrix.  Fulton Superior Court.  May 16, 1949.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case is here on writ of error from Fulton Superior Court complaining of an order overruling general and special demurrers and granting a temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case originated when Atlanta Gas Light Company filed a bill in equity against the Georgia Public Service Commission and the individual members of the commission.  In substance the petition alleged that on December 11, 1948, the Public Service Commission passed an order directing the petitioner to make certain adjustments of charges to its existing customers who had purchased gas under rate schedule N-4 of the petitioner, and that this order was amended on December 22, 1948.  Said orders are attached to the petition.  (Further reference to these orders will be made in the opinion.) It was alleged: That the company's schedules N-4 and N-9 were duly established and fixed by the commission, and gas was sold by the petitioner to its customers.  Rate N-4 makes a higher charge for gas sold than did the price provided in rate N-9.  Rate N-4 customers, in favor of whom the commission ordered an adjustment of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  charges by its order of December 22, purchased gas from the petitioner during the entire period of time referred to in said order, and paid to the petitioner for such gas purchased under said rate.  Rate N-4 was established and fixed by the commission, and customers who purchased gas under this rate executed contracts with the petitioner through the entire period of time covered by the order of December 22.  It was further alleged that the effect of the so-called adjustment of charges, which the commission ordered the petitioner to make with the existing rate N-4 customers, was to order the petitioner to make refunds to those N-4 customers of a part of the sums paid by such customers to the petitioner for gas purchased by them prior to the date of the order of December 22.  It was alleged that the order of December 22 was wholly void &quot;on each and every one of the following grounds:&quot; (a) The commission had no power to order a public utility, subject to its jurisdiction, to refund any part of the price paid by a customer to the gas company for gas purchased by that customer.  (b) The commission had no power to order any reparations to customers of public utilities.  (c) The commission, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  having fixed a rate for a public utility, had no power, after gas had been sold under that rate, to order retroactively that a different rate be applied to the gas purchased under the rate fixed by the commission.  (d) The commission is an administrative body, and has no power to order public utilities subject to its jurisdiction to pay sums of money to its customers by way of adjustment of rates for the past or otherwise.  In (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), and (k), it was alleged that if any act of the General Assembly of Georgia authorizes the Public Service Commission to order the petitioner to make refunds or adjustments to its customers to whom gas was sold prior to December 22, 1948, such act is void because in violation of the provisions of art. 1, sec. 3, par. 2, art. 1, sec. 1, par. 3, and art. 1, sec. 1, par. 23 of the Constitutions of Georgia of 1877 and 1945, and of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; also that said order is violative of art. 1, sec. 3, par. 2, and art. 1, sec. 1, par. 3, of the Constitutions of Georgia of 1877 and 1945, and of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was further alleged that, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under section 93-416 of the Code, a public utility is subject to a penalty of $ 5000 for each offense, if it shall fail, omit, or neglect to obey, observe, and comply with any order or direction of the Public Service Commission; and if it fails to make the adjustment ordered by the commission, it may be liable to a forfeiture of $ 5000 for each day on which it fails to make the adjustment of charges provided for in said order.  It was alleged that the order of December 22 is void; that the Public Service Commission asserts that it is valid; and that the petitioner is without adequate remedy except in a court of equity, and it files this bill for the purpose of restraining and enjoining the defendants from enforcing the order of December 22, 1948.  The prayers are that the defendants be restrained from enforcing either of the orders of December 11 or December 22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants filed a general and special demurrer to the petition, the grounds of which are sufficiently indicated in the opinion and will not be set out here.  The defendants assert that the order of December 22 is valid, and that the plaintiff is estopped from contending that the commission was without power to promulgate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  said orders.  In paragraph 14 of their answer the defendants set out various orders of the commission from December 28, 1945, through December 22, 1948, dealing with the question of rate schedules charged by the plaintiff to consumers of gas under what is known as uninterruptible and interruptible schedules and designated as rates N-4 and N-9.  The defendants set out extracts from orders of the commission; hearings before the commission; that the commission issued an order dated December 22, 1947, to apply retroactively the N-9 adjustment rate to these same gas consumers remaining on rate schedule N-4, &quot;said retroactive application to be made from January 2, 1947, to November 30, 1947, provided that the N-4 gas consumer elects to contract for gas service on the N-9 rate schedule hereafter, such election to be made on or before January 15, 1948&quot;; and that substantial refunds were made to N-4 customers who elected to transfer to N-9 schedules.  It is contended that the plaintiff, having voluntarily made certain refunds under the order of December 22, 1947, was estopped to complain of the present orders.  It was alleged that the adjustments in past billings for gas service ordered by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the commission on December 22, 1948, are within the jurisdiction of the commission; and that, having decided that the character of service rendered by the petitioner was that provided by schedule N-9, the commission had the right to apply to that service the charge under schedule N-9, and order an adjustment of charges accordingly.  It was asserted that the defendant commission had the power to make an order requiring the plaintiff to adjust its bills rendered for the service in compliance with the conditions of the rate charged, so as to cause the bills to reflect a charge for the type and character of service actually rendered.  Attached to the answer as an exhibit is a list of refunds proposed to the Public Service Commission of retroactive billings, to N-4 and N-9 customers for the period from January 2, 1947, to November 30, 1947, which shows the names and addresses of the customer, revenue billed, revenue from retroactive rate, and the amount of refund to the customers.  By amendment, the defendants set out the special concurring opinion of the Chairman of the Public Service Commission on the order of December 22, 1948.  They also asserted that the power to make such reasonable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rules and regulations as may be necessary for preventing unjust discrimination on the part of the gas company to consumers of its product has been granted to the commissioners by the General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case came on to be heard upon the prayer of the plaintiff for an interlocutory injunction.  The general and special demurrers were argued, and the court reserved its ruling thereon.  On the hearing the plaintiff introduced in evidence certified copies of its rate schedules N-4 and N-9 issued on January 10, 1947, and filed with the commission.  It also introduced in evidence an affidavit of D. A. Crawford, vice-president of the petitioner, which set out in separate columns the names of the consumers; revenue as billed by the petitioner during the prior period and specified in the order of December 22, 1948, and collected from the consumers; revenue from the N-9 rate as ordered by the commission; the amount of refunds it would have to make to eleven of its customers; and the amount that three of its customers would have to make to the petitioner.  The amount of adjustments that the petitioner would have to make to N-4 rate customers under the order of December 22, 1948, amounted to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  $ 101,067.52; and the amount that it would receive from three of its customers who had purchased gas under the N-4 rate instead of being billed under the N-9 rate was shown as $ 8504.07; and the net amount that the petitioner was required to make refunds of to the other eleven customers amounted to $ 92,563.45.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants offered separately in evidence: certified copies of various rules issued by the Public Service Commission to the petitioner; copies of numerous orders issued by the commission which involved questions of rate schedules of the petitioner; all of such rules covering the period of December 28, 1945, to December 22, 1948.  The defendants also offered in evidence the record of hearings before the commission on the aforesaid rules, containing evidence before the commission; various rules and orders; extracts from evidence before the commission on hearings relating to rates N-4 and N-9 of the petitioner; evidence as to the order of December 22, 1947, and the making of rebates by the petitioner to certain of its customers; certain letters written by the commission to certain customers of the petitioner who were affected by the order of December 22, 1947; and the oral&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  testimony of the petitioner under rate N-4 as to the service under said rate subsequent to the order of December 22, 1947; the testimony of the chairman of the commission, and of a rate expert, as to transactions between the commission and the petitioner in regard to the rate schedule and retroactive adjustment of 1947.  As the evidence of various witnesses was offered separately, the petitioner objected separately to the admission of each offer, upon the ground that the proffered evidence was immaterial and irrelevant, in that the complaint is that the specific orders of December 11 and 22 are void as being beyond the power of the commission, in violation of certain constitutional provisions, and that the evidence offered could throw no light on the validity or invalidity of said orders.  The court sustained each and every objection to the proffered evidence, and error is separately assigned on these rulings.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the court entered an order overruling each of the grounds of the demurrers of the defendants, and entered an order restraining them from enforcing the orders of December 11 and 22, 1948.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this writ of error, the defendants assign error on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (a) the order overruing the demurrers; (b) the order granting an interlocutory injunction; and (c) the rulings of the court sustaining objections to the admission of certain evidence offered by the defendants.  The parties will be referred to as in the same positions that they occupied in the trial court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff utility company filed a bill in equity against defendants, the Georgia Public Service Commission and its members, alleging that defendants' orders directing plaintiff to make retroactive adjustments to charges to existing customers for natural gas were beyond its authority and unconstitutional. The trial court overruled defendants' demurrers and entered an order restraining enforcement of the orders. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. It held that the petition was not subject to demurrer on the ground that the action was one against the state; the ground of demurrer that plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law, either by the writ of certiorari, or by asserting the invalidity of the orders upon any future action to enforce the penalties prescribed by law for a violation of the commission's orders, was properly overruled because due process required that the state provide access for review by a judicial tribunal prior to the collection of the adjustments claimed. The court also held that the portions of the order that required plaintiff to make retroactive rate adjustments were beyond the lawful powers of defendants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the provisions of an act of the General Assembly of Georgia approved February 25, 1949 (Ga. L. 1949, p. 1204), entitled &quot;Voters' Registration Act,&quot; the Judge of Richmond Superior Court appointed J. Walker Harper, C. Nolan Bowden, and G. E. Murphey as County Registrars, and fixed their compensation as follows: Chairman of the Board, $ 350 per month; $ 75 per month to each member.  Said act provided that the salaries and expenses of the board be paid from the county treasury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs, as County Registrars of Richmond County, filed their application for the writ of mandamus against David Franklin, Chairman of the Board of Commissioners of Roads and Revenues of said county, and alleged that they had entered upon their duties as County Registrars on April 1, 1949, and during the month of April exercised the powers and duties of office required of members of the Board of Registrars, attaching to the petition a copy of the order of the superior court appointing them and fixing their compensation.  On April 5, 1949, the defendant was advised of their appointment and qualification.  Said board&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was advised by the Board of Commissioners of Roads and Revenues to proceed with the administration of the Voters' Registration Act, and at that time no question was raised as to the payment of the salaries of the members of the board.  On April 30, county warrants, in the form used by Richmond County, for the payment of salaries fixed in the order of the court, were presented to the defendant for his signature, said warrants having been signed by the Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Board of Commissioners of Roads and Revenues, but the defendant refused to sign the warrants.  Thereafter the Board of Commissioners of Roads and Revenues on May 3 passed a resolution directing the defendant to sign said warrants, and authorized the payment of the petitioners' salaries for the month of April, and the warrants were again presented to the defendant and he refused to sign them, on the ground that the Voters' Registration Act under which the petitioners were acting was invalid.  The petitioners alleged that they will suffer pecuniary loss for which they cannot be compensated in damages, because of the defendant's failure to carry out the duties of his office.  They have no other remedy, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  legal or equitable.  The prayer was that a writ of mandamus be issued, requiring the defendant to sign the warrants drawn for the petitioners' salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this petition the defendant filed general and special demurrers.  By the general demurrers, the defendant attacked the validity of the Voters' Registration Act on the grounds: (a) Said act violates art. 1, sec. 1, par. 3 of the Constitution of Georgia (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-103), which provides, &quot;No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, except by due process of law,&quot; in that such act is discriminatory against the right of one to exercise his franchise, and tends to take away the liberty of the voters of the State of Georgia without due process of law.  (b) It violates art. 1, sec. 1, par. 1 of the Constitution of Georgia (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-101), which provides, &quot;All government, of right, originates with the people, is founded upon their will only, and is instituted solely for the good of the whole.  Public officers are the trustees and servants of the people, and, at all times, amenable to them,&quot; in that this defendant is Chairman of the Board of Commissioners of Roads and Revenues of Richmond County, which controls&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the fiscal affairs of said county, and it is his duty to conserve the money of Richmond County under his control; and since the act relied upon impinges upon the section of the Constitution above quoted, such proceeding should be dismissed.  (c) It violates art. 1, sec. 1, par. 2 of the Constitution of Georgia (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-102), which provides, &quot;Protection to person and property is the paramount duty of government, and shall be impartial and complete,&quot; because such act sets up a system of censorship contrary to the principles of a democratic form of government; and since the defendant is a public official, Chairman of the Board of Commissioners of Roads and Revenues which controls the fiscal affairs of said county, such proceeding should be dismissed.  (d) Said act violates the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States (Code, Ann., &sect; 1-815), which provides: &quot;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.  No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws&quot; -- because it abridges the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, and deprives persons of liberty without due process of law, since the right to vote is the very foundation of a democratic form of government; &quot;and to set up a board which has power to discriminate and censor the right of citizens to vote, who are the creators of the government, and is therefore void&quot;; and no order of a judge of the superior court can give validity thereto, nor impose upon this defendant the duty of approving vouchers for payment of so-called salaries of any such board.  (e) Said act violates the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States (Code, Ann., &sect; 1-820), which provides, &quot;The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,&quot; because the act abridges the right of citizens to vote on account of race or color; that it leaves to three men unlimited and arbitrary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  power to declare them ineligible to vote; and the defendant is Chairman of the Board of Commissioners of Roads and Revenues, which has control of the fiscal affairs of Richmond County, and it is his duty to protect the interest of voters of every class and not to pay out any public money for any purpose other than is expressly provided by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By general demurrer the defendant also contends that the plaintiffs have an ample remedy at law, in that it appears that the defendant is not liable to pay to the plaintiffs any salary; that there is no specific law which would require this defendant to sign any warrant; and, further, it does not appear from the petition that the defendant has any funds in hand from which the court can compel the payment of the salaries claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were also several special demurrers, one of which was on the ground of misjoinder of parties plaintiff, which ground was expressly abandoned by the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition for mandamus and the demurrer thereto came on to be heard by the trial judge, who entered an order overruling all grounds of the general and special demurrers.  The defendant filed no response, and it was agreed between the parties that the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prayer for the writ of mandamus absolute be passed upon by the trial judge on the facts stated in the petition.  After a hearing, the court entered an order granting the prayer for a writ of mandamus, and the case is before this court on a bill of exceptions to both orders.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decisions.

It was alleged that a judicial determination of the constitutionality of the act is necessary to determine whether or not the commissioners should pay the compensation provided in the act.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the judge failed to demonstrate that he could challenge the constitutionality of the Act. The court noted that the judge was required to show that he had personally suffered an injury by the application of the Act before he could challenge its constitutionality. The court observed that the judge had received a salary increase under the Act and that higher salaries given to other judges did not amount to a denial of the equal protection of the law.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is one of several cases now pending in this court originating in Chatham County, relative to proposed increases in the compensation of the various public officials of that county, this particular case having reference to the act of the General Assembly (Ga. L. 1949, p. 406), authorizing the Commissioners of Chatham County to supplement from county funds and as a court expense the salary of the Judge of the Superior Court of the Eastern Judicial Circuit of Georgia, which lies wholly within Chatham County, in the sum of $ 1000 in addition to the salary &quot;now provided for by the Constitution of the State,&quot; and providing that &quot;This act shall be effective, in all respects, on approval by the Governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 18, 1949, pursuant to the provisions of this act, the Commissioners of Chatham County adopted an ordinance providing that the existing salary of said judge be supplemented in the sum of $ 1000 per annum out of county funds, and the commissioners made payment of the supplemental salary effective immediately upon the adoption of this ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 27, 1949, the commissioners&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the county, acting upon the protest of certain citizens, filed in the Superior Court of Chatham County a petition for a declaratory judgment as to the validity of the said act and ordinance and of the payment of the salary increase thus authorized to the judge then in commission, naming as defendants therein Honorable David S. Atkinson, as Judge of the Superior Court of Chatham County, and Honorable Eugene Cook, Attorney-General of the State of Georgia.  The questions presented by this petition were: (1) May a salary be paid by Chatham County to the Judge of the Superior Court of the Eastern Judicial Circuit of Georgia supplemental to that now paid under the Constitutional Amendment of 1927, set out in Georgia Laws 1927, page 111, by reason of the legislative act of 1949 as attached hereto and marked exhibit &quot;A,&quot; followed by County Ordinance of February 17, 1949, exhibit &quot;B,&quot; under authority of article VI, section XII, paragraph I (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-4701) of the Constitution of Georgia, 1945?  (2) May such salary increase be lawfully paid by the county during the term for which the incumbent judge is then commissioned?  and (3) Will paragraph IV, section I, article XII of the Constitution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of 1945 (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-8004) have the effect of preserving the local constitutional amendment of 1927 (Georgia Laws 1927, page 111), above referred to, so as to keep the local constitutional amendment of 1927, in effect until repealed or amended by a constitutional amendment adopted subsequently hereto?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pertinent provisions of the act and ordinance referred to are as follows: &quot;An Act providing for a salary of One Thousand ($ 1000.00) Dollars per year to be paid to the Judge of the Superior Court of the Eastern Judicial Circuit of Georgia by the Commissioners of Chatham County, in addition to that now provided for by the Constitution of the State, and for other purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Georgia by authority of Article VI, Section XII, Paragraph I (Code, Section 2-4701) of the Constitution of the State of Georgia, that the County Commissioners of Chatham County, Georgia, and Ex-officio Judges thereof, are hereby authorized to supplement the present salary of the Judge of the Superior Court of the Eastern Judicial Circuit of Georgia, which lies wholly within the County of Chatham, in the sum of One Thousand ($ 1000.00) Dollars per year, out&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of County funds in addition to amounts now being paid under the Constitution of Georgia, that is to say, One Thousand ($ 1000.00) Dollars per annum in addition to the salary of Six Thousand ($ 6000.00) Dollars per annum paid by the State under Article VI, Section XII, Paragraph I, of the Constitution of 1945, and in addition to the Five Thousand ($ 5000.00) Dollars per annum paid by Chatham County under the Constitutional Amendment adopted by the General Assembly in 1927 (Georgia Law, 1927, p. 111) and ratified Nov. 6, 1928, such supplemental salary if so fixed shall be paid to the incumbent Judge and charged as a court expense of Chatham County, Georgia.</SPAN></P>

Armstrong and 24 other named persons, alleging themselves&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be citizens and taxpayers of the county, filed their intervention in said proceeding, in which they attack the validity and the constitutionality of the act and ordinance upon the grounds: (a) That the Judge of the Superior Court of the Eastern Judicial Circuit is an elective constitutional officer within the purview of article III, section XI, paragraph I of the Constitution of Georgia, 1945; and the incumbent judge was &quot;in commission&quot; at the time of the adoption of said act and said &quot;ordinance&quot; aforesaid.  (b) That the defendant Atkinson was commissioned for a term of office beginning January 1, 1949, and ending December 31, 1952, and the General Assembly was without power or authority to prescribe or fix any other or different salary or compensation affecting said judge during said term, than the salary fixed by law and existing at the time said officer was commissioned for said term, or to authorize and empower the Commissioners of Chatham County to do so.  (c) That the salary fixed by law to be paid from the funds of Chatham County to said judge at the time he was commissioned on January 1, 1949, in addition to his salary from the State, was $ 5000 per annum, as provided by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an amendment to the Constitution of Georgia in 1927 (Ga. L. 1927, p. 111); and the intervenors would show that any delegation of power by the legislature to the Commissioners of Chatham County to supplement said judge's salary was subject to the provisions of the Constitution of Georgia referred to in subparagraph &quot;A&quot; hereof, to the effect that such change shall not affect the officer(s) &quot;then in commission.&quot; And (d), that the aforesaid act is invalid and unconstitutional, because the same contains matter different from what is expressed in the title thereof, contrary to and in violation of article III, section VII, paragraph VIII of the 1945 Constitution of the State of Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the petition of the commissioners the defendant, Honorable David S. Atkinson, Judge of the Superior Court of the Eastern Judicial Circuit, filed an answer, in which he denied that the act and ordinance under attack were invalid for any reason, and contended that the act and ordinance, and payment of the supplemental salary therein provided for to the judge then in commission, were valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the hearing, Honorable Melville Price, Judge of the Superior Courts of the Atlantic Judicial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Circuit, presiding because of the disqualification of the Judge of Chatham Superior Court, rendered a judgment to the effect that said act and ordinance were in all respects valid and constitutional, and directing the Chatham County Commissioners to make payment of the supplemental salary &quot;to the duly elected and qualified Judge of the Superior Court of the Eastern Judicial Circuit from and after the effective date of the ordinance, February 18, 1949.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county commissioners challenged the validity of 1949 Ga.

The trial court entered judgment in favor of the judge and the citizens, who intervened, and the court affirmed. The court found that the act did not violate Ga. Const. art. 3, &sect; 11, para. 1. The court found the act did not violate O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-4701, which fixed the salaries to be paid out of the state treasury to the judges and provided that any county could supplement the salary of the judges out of county funds. The court found the language used only authorized, and did not require, the county commissioners to supplement the salary and was not violative of the state constitution. The court also found that 1927 Ga. Laws 111 was not repealed by the 1945 revision of the state constitution. The court found no merit in the county commissioners' claim that the 1949 Ga. Laws 406 was violative of O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-1908 because the constitutional amendment was a valid continuing pre-existing constitutional amendment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J. P. Houlihan and four other named persons, Commissioners of Chatham County, Georgia, and Ex-Officio Judges thereof, filed a petition in the superior court of that county, naming as defendants Alex R. MacDonell, Judge, Mose Portman, Clerk, and A. Ben Connor, Sheriff, of the City Court of Savannah, and Eugene Cook, Attorney-General of Georgia.  The petition alleged substantially: A controversy has arisen as to the validity and constitutionality of an act of the General Assembly of Georgia approved February 9, 1949 (Ga. L. 1949, p. 403), fixing salaries of the officers of the City Court of Savannah named as defendants.  &quot;Petitioners believe in view of the fact that, because a controversy has arisen as to whether or not petitioners are constitutionally authorized and directed to expend the taxpayers' money for the additional compensation set forth in said act, that a judicial determination of the constitutionality and validity of said act is necessary . . .  Petitioners show that, in the best interest of justice and fairness to all persons concerned, this court should issue a declaratory&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judgment, declaring whether or not said act . . is a valid part of the statute law of Georgia, and within the purview of the Constitution.&quot; The substantial prayers were that a decree issue declaring and determining the &quot;validity or invalidity, constitutionality or unconstitutionality,&quot; of the act referred to, and for general relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants (other than the Attorney-General) filed a joint answer, asserting the validity of the act in question, and after several references to the history of the City Court of Savannah and acts of the legislature passed in regard to salaries of its officers, alleged: &quot;Defendants further show that they are elected in the same manner as county officers being voted upon by the qualified voters of Chatham County, being residents of Chatham County as provided by law and being elected for a four-year term of office.  That said court was established by a special or local legislative act, and that all amendments to the act creating said court have been by special or local acts.  That the City Court of Savannah is a creation of the General Assembly and the judge, the sheriff, and the clerk thereof are statutory officers; and that they are county officers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  being paid out of the treasury of Chatham County to the exclusion of all State funds.  That they are not constitutional officers, and that there is no constitutional prohibition which would prevent the General Assembly from enacting legislation affecting said court, its officers, or the compensation of your judge, the sheriff, or the clerk of said court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the filing of the answer, the court allowed an intervention by 25 persons as citizens and taxpayers of Chatham County, in which intervention the act of 1949, supra, was attacked as being violative of art. 3, sec. 11, par. 1 of the Constitution of Georgia of 1945.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the hearing of the case, the defendants introduced in evidence their answer, and the act involved.  The following judgment was rendered: &quot;The foregoing matter coming on to be heard, on all issues submitted to the court, including the intervention filed, it is the judgment and order of the court: 1. That the act of the legislature of 1949, referred to in the pleadings, held to have been enacted under authority of the Constitution and laws of Georgia and is legal.  2.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs excepted to said judgment, and &quot;assign the same as error, upon the following grounds: in that the court erred in failing to render a judgment declaring&quot; the act in question &quot;to be unconstitutional and in violation of and in conflict with&quot; art. 3, sec. 11, par. 1 &quot;of the Constitution of Georgia of 1945, which reads as follows: . . 'The General Assembly may, at any time, by a majority vote of both branches, prescribe other and different salaries for all the elective officers provided for in this Constitution, but no such change shall affect the officers then in commission.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
