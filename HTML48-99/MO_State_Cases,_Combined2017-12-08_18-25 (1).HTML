A circuit court (Missouri) found that the claimant did not receive a fair hearing and remanded the matter for redetermination pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 208.100(5), for which the Department sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the Department's Division of Welfare removed the claimant as a benefits recipient, the claimant appealed to the Department. The Division's action was based on the medical review team report that, in turn, was based on the medical report and certification of one doctor. A referee conducted a hearing and the hearing record was the basis for the Department's decision. Neither the doctor nor the medical team testified at the hearing and the medical review team report was admitted into evidence after it was &quot;identified&quot; by a county director. The court held that: (1) the manner in which the documentary evidence was admitted at the hearing constituted hearsay; (2) the Department's view of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 208.040(2) failed to differentiate between the validity of the requirement that physical incapacity be certified and the competency of that certification as evidence; (3) the certification requirement could not elevate hearsay evidence to the status of &quot;competent and substantial evidence&quot;; and (4) because the claimant's counsel objected to the documentary evidence, it could not be considered and, as a result, the record did not support the Department's action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed a complaint against defendants and alleged that they entered into a conspiracy and actuated by malice and by a determination to deprive him of his property and legal right. The trial court judgment was entered for the employee. Defendants appealed to the supreme court where it held it was without jurisdiction to hear and determine the cause and it was ordered that the case be transferred to the court. The court held that the employee was authorized, under the plant agreement between the union and the employer, to accept the lateral transfer in question. The court held that under the law as declared in Missouri the union had not acted strictly within the scope of its power. The court found that that local 6313 was without jurisdiction to, again, charge and try the employee on the same charge as was involved in his trial by local 3135. The employee was entitled to seek relief in a court of equity. The policy of the union under which the employee was tried was void because it deprived him of the rights accorded him under a contract between the employer and the union and not only affected the rights of the employee but those of a third party, the employer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the conviction, contending that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 563.280 upon which the prosecution was based was vague and indefinite and violative of Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that there was doubt as to its jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and therefore, it transferred the case to the Missouri Supreme Court for final and authoritative determination. The Missouri Supreme Court had exclusive appellate jurisdiction because the case involved the construction of the state and federal constitutions. Defendant met the requirements for review by raising the issue at the first available opportunity and kept the issue alive in his motion for a new trial and in his appellate brief. The court held that defendant's reference to the Due Process Clause instead of using the specific article and section numbers was just as precise because of the common knowledge among lawyers and judges of what is meant by the Due Process Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A condemnation proceeding was a special proceeding, and Mo. Rev.

However, &sect; 523.030 said that publication was allowed where the name or residence of the property owner was unknown or if the owners or any of them did not reside within Missouri. The court found that the owner argued to the trial court that service by publication for condemnation proceedings was not authorized for a resident of Missouri. The owner said to the court that he was a resident of Missouri and that he was at the time of publication in the military stationed in New York City. The court ruled, inter alia, that it was the duty of the judge to determine whether or not their was compliance with procedures for special proceedings, which allowed for service by publication; it was a question of fact for the trial court, and the court was not shown by the application in this case that the trial court committed error in making its findings of fact.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county hospital trustees filed an action against defendants, associations and medical and osteopathic physicians, for declaratory judgment on whether a rule excluding doctors of osteopathy from practicing in the hospital violated the laws of Missouri. The trustees and medical physicians appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court from the circuit court's decision that the rule was illegal. The Missouri Supreme Court transferred the cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustees and medical physicians maintained that the rule excluding osteopaths was not in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 205.300 because the trustees were allowed to adopt rules not inconsistent with the general law and that osteopathy was not a school of medicine within the meaning of &sect; 205.300. In adopting the circuit court's decree in part, the court found that the rule contravened the provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 205.300. &quot;School of medicine&quot; included osteopathy and &sect; 205.300 prohibited the boards of county hospitals from discriminating against any school of medicine. In addition, &sect; 205.300 provided that the patient in the county hospital had the absolute right to the physician of his choice. Section 205.300 did not qualify which school of medicine the physician could belong to and the Legislature had considered and called doctors of osteopathy &quot;physicians&quot; in legislation regulating their practice. The court did not adopt that portion of the circuit court's decree that broadly set out what the circuit court held to be the practice of osteopathy under the law because that issue was not before the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment that the rule was illegal, that osteopathic physicians and surgeons were practitioners of a school of medicine and were physicians and surgeons within the meaning of the Missouri statutes regulating their practice rights, and were entitled to take their patients to the county hospital for treatment. The court reversed the circuit court's judgment as to what the practice of osteopathy was.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor argued that the petition had not alleged that an election had been held and the increased tax rate approved by a majority of the qualified voters; and that without such election and approval, certification of an additional levy and extension of it upon the tax books was unlawful. The creditor admitted the lack of voter approval, and conceded that if it was true that the debtor could not levy in excess of 65 cents on the $ 100 assessed valuation without voter approval, then the levy that was peremptorily ordered by the trial court was in excess of constitutional authority. Absent an allegation that the proposed rate had received voter approval, the petition failed to state facts upon which the trial court was authorized to award the creditor the relief it sought; in undertaking to compel the debtor to certify and extend upon the tax books a rate of $ 1.95 on the $ 100 assessed valuation where there had been no voter approval, the court was mistakenly compelling the performance of an illegal act.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court looked at 10 questionable ballots and found that the contestee had more votes. The contestant appealed. The court held that two of ballots could not be counted because three names were marked for the city council position and only two votes were allowed. A ballot that did not have a black sticker on the back in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 111.620 (1949) was counted because the sticker became loosened and was not intentionally removed. Four ballots where the voters used a check mark instead of a cross-mark (X) were counted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured guest tried and submitted his case on the fact that the property owners failed to construct and maintain a hand rail along both sides of the stairway as required by the local building code. The property owners urged that the guest failed to make a submissible case because the building code that required hand railings along the stairway in a building such as their building was not applicable to their building. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the evidence disclosed that the property owners' building existed for many years prior to the date the building code became law. Further, the building had undergone no major structural changes, additions, or remodeling since that date so as to make it subject to the provisions of the building code with reference to stairway hand railings. Consequently, the court concluded that the injured guest submitted the case on an alleged violation of a building code that was inapplicable. Further, the stairway conformed to all requirements as of the date the building was constructed, and the stairway was properly maintained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action for the formation of a levee district, appellant proponents of the district challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Ripley County (Missouri) in favor of respondent objecting landowners, denying formation of the district. The proponents contended that the trial court erred in permitting 63 landowners who signed the original petition to withdraw their signatures and in finding that the levee would not protect the area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to have the United States Government construct a levee to protect district lands, the proponents of a levee district obtained signatures on a petition from over half the landowners and sought recognition of the district in the trial court. The objecting landowners opposed the petition on two grounds. First, by objecting to 63 signatures that would decrease the majority needed for passage, and second, by demonstrating that the proposed levee district would not protect the lands in question from flooding. On review from an adverse judgment, the proponents contended that the 63 signatures should not have been stricken under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12495 (1939) (now Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 245.025 (1949)) and that they were not required under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12492 (1939) (repealed and reenacted in 1947, Vol. 2, p. 226) to provide a plan for protection of the land. The court found that the signatures were erroneously excluded under the statute but affirmed the case. The court reasoned that regardless of the error, the objectors had the right to present evidence demonstrating that the proposed levee district would not provide protection from overflow waters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner instituted a proceeding in habeas corpus after he was adjudged in contempt by the Probate Court of DeKalb County (Missouri) for failing to comply with a judgment in a proceeding to discover assets of an estate. The probate court ordered petitioner confined in jail until he delivered to the administratrix of the estate of petitioner's father a certain amount of cash.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administratrix filed in the probate court an affidavit, alleging that she had good cause to believe and did believe that petitioner had concealed or was otherwise wrongfully withholding a sum of money belonging to the estate of the deceased. The administratrix contended further that said property was in petitioner's possession or under his control and should be recovered for the estate of the deceased. The court found that petitioner was entitled to habeas relief because the order of commitment did not show on its face any contempt under the law. There was no finding that petitioner had the property in his possession and control. Thus, the judgment was, at most, a mere judgment for debt, for the default of which no contempt and imprisonment could apply. Contempt for failure to obey a judgment to deliver property had to necessarily presuppose the possibility of compliance, and its essence was the willful, contemptuous, and contumacious refusal to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the prior adjudication of delinquency, it was found that the daughter committed perjury in a criminal rape case. She had been sworn therein to testify in the trial of defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and she falsely testified that he did not rape her. The mother urged that the circuit court in the prior delinquency proceeding lacked jurisdiction over her daughter or over the subject matter, as her daughter committed no crime. The mother claimed that the hearing in the criminal case on the motion was a nullity, and thus no crimes could have been committed therein. The court ordered the daughter's discharge from custody, as she did not commit a crime. The criminal court proceeding on the motion was null and void, as that court lacked jurisdiction to hear the motion where it was filed after defendant's conviction and sentence had become final. Thus, no crime could have occurred in that hearing. It was a nullity. Therefore, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the daughter as a juvenile delinquent, as she did not commit a crime. The entire process in that court was issued under circumstances not allowed by law under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 532.430 (1949).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators alleged that the school board produced minutes from the annual meeting incorrectly reported the results of an election for school board director and a vote on a proposal to consolidate with another school district. The trial court originally issued a writ of mandamus requiring the minutes to be rewritten, then granted the school board's motion to quash the writ and dismiss relators' petition. The court on appeal reversed, holding that mandamus was an appropriate remedy for the correction and amendment of municipal records. Relators and the public had a right to have the minutes accurately reflect the decisions made at the school board meeting. Relators were not seeking to contest the result of an election; rather, they were seeking to compel the school board to rewrite the minutes to accurately reflect the results of the votes for director and consolidation. Therefore, the court held that whether the results of the two contested votes were properly recorded could be decided in a mandamus proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his petition for divorce, the husband alleged that the wife's address was unknown to him.

In neither his petition nor in his application for order of publication did the husband state that the wife was a nonresident, that she had absconded or absented herself from her usual place of abode, or that she had concealed herself. The court found that neither the husband's petition nor his application for order of publication complied with 1945 Mo. Laws 28(b), the controlling statute. The court held that it could not read into 1945 Mo. Laws 28(b) any authority for constructive notice on the mere ground that the husband did not know the present address of the wife and had been unable to obtain it. The husband's application for an order for publication of service was insufficient to authorize the order made.

Because the ground was snow-covered, the farmer was able to follow the dogs' bloody tracks to defendant's yard. The farmer confronted defendant, but defendant denied any knowledge of the incident. On appeal, defendant first argued that the court did not have jurisdiction because he raised the issue of the constitutionality of the statute so as to give the Missouri Supreme Court jurisdiction. The court concluded that jurisdiction was proper because defendant did not properly raise the constitutional issue. The court affirmed the judgment, rejecting defendant's contention that the information did not state facts sufficient to constitute any offense against the laws of Missouri. Contrary to defendant's assertion that the information charged two separate and distinct offenses, the court found that the information charged only one offense. The court also concluded that the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to support the verdict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from its conviction by a circuit court (Missouri) for refusing to allow one of its employees, who was entitled to vote at an election, to absent himself from his employment for a period of four hours between the times of the opening and closing of the polls in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11785.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with refusing to allow an employee to absent himself from work for a period of four hours between the times of the opening and closing of the polls. Defendant was also charged with having penalized the employee by deducting from his wages the amount of his earnings for the time he was absent from his work in the exercise of his privilege to vote. The trial court overruled defendant's motion to quash the first count of the information concerning the refusal to let the employee leave, and sustained defendant's motion to quash the second count concerning the deduction of wages. On appeal, the court reversed as to both counts and remanded for a trial on the second count. The employee usually worked until four thirty in the afternoon. Defendant permitted the employees to leave at three o'clock on that day to vote. Thus, the employee was given four consecutive hours away from work on election day and the purpose of the statute was met. However, if defendant penalized the employee by deducting from his salary for the hour and a half he was absent from his work to vote, it was clearly a violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11785.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Henry County (Missouri) that denied their application for an injunction against defendant city to prohibit the city from enforcing an ordinance that extended the city's jurisdiction over the landowners' property, so the city would not levy and collect taxes based on their property ownership and require merchants' licenses in the area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners claimed that the ordinance was unreasonable, oppressive, unconstitutional, unjust, and a fraud upon the residents of the extended area because the extended area was agricultural land and that the city did not and could not furnish any benefits to the landowners. The court determined that the city had the authority under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 7097 (1939) to extend its limits upon a vote of the majority of the legal voters of the city, which was done. The court held that the burden was on the landowners to prove that the city's ordinance was unreasonable and the evidence showed that the area obtained by the city was provided services from another city, which meant that the property was adaptable for city purposes. The court also held that the evidence showed that the property taken by the city had a higher value as part of the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his petition, the broker alleged that he was then, and at all times mentioned in the petition, a real estate broker in Springfield, Missouri, and as such broker made a contract with the sellers for the sale of certain hotel property, together with adjoining lots, and some personal property in Branson, Missouri, and thereafter procured a buyer for the property at a figure satisfactory to the sellers. The broker appealed from a judgment for the sellers. After the case was submitted to the court, the broker filed a motion in the court to transfer the case to the supreme court on account of the alleged unconstitutionality of 1941 Mo. Laws &sect; 16, p. 431, which provided that a broker, when bringing an action for commissions, was required to alleged that he was a licensed real estate broker at the time the alleged cause of action arose. The court affirmed the judgment. The constitutional question was raised too late to have been considered on appeal. Further, neither the broker's petition or his evidence alleged or proved that he had procured the license required by &sect; 16 prior to bringing the suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant bus company sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court St. Louis County (Missouri), which ruled in favor of plaintiff insurer in its action for declaratory judgment to determine the obligation of the insured bus company under the terms of two policies of liability insurance. The insurer, having paid out an amount in excess of its liability under one of the policies, claimed that the company was obligated to it for the overpayment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer issued policies of insurance to cover buses that were owned and operated by the company and the buses so covered were listed in a schedule attached to the policy. One policy provided coverage for the negligent operation of the buses described in the amount of $ 10,000 as to any one person and $ 20,000 as to any one accident. The insurer issued another policy to cover another bus with limits of $ 5,000 to any one person and $ 90,000 as to any accident. The bus covered by the first policy was involved in automobile accident and was adjudged liable to a number of claimants. The insurer paid the judgments in excess of the aggregate coverage under the first policy. The court held that the action was properly brought as a declaratory action under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1127 and that the proper endorsements for the state public service commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission were attached to the policies. The court concluded that, although the policies provided that other buses could be substituted for the ones covered, such provision could not be construed in isolation and that the policies read as a whole merely allowed the buses covered by the policies to be replaced.</SPAN></P>

The prosecution alleged that defendant blocked, pushed, and pulled at the police officer who arrested the shooter. Both parties' witnesses presented conflicting testimony. The court held that the prosecution satisfied its burden of proof to support the conviction The court determined that testimony of the police officers was not contrary to common observation and experience. The court decided that the prosecution's evidence could reasonably convince the trial court of defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court determined that defendant waived his contention that the ordinance was void for containing more than one subject, contrary to St. Louis, Mo., City Charter &sect; 13, art. IV. The waiver occurred because defendant's objection, which first occurred in his motion for new trial, came too late. The court found that defendant failed to file any motion to quash the information. The court rejected as meritless defendant's contention that the ordinance was unintelligible because it clearly described the offense. The court concluded that the ordinance defined the offense of interfering with a police officer.</SPAN></P>
