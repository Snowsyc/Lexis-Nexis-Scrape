The court held that, while defendant's convictions were proper, the sentence of death was error. The court held: (1) defendant was not in custody at the time of the challenged statements and, thus, was not entitled to Miranda warnings; (2) the circuit court properly denied defendant's motion for a change of venue on the basis of pretrial publicity because voir dire revealed that none of the jurors had specific knowledge about the case or had formed opinions as to his guilt; (3) evidence that defendant was involved in prior incidents in which the decedent suffered similar injuries was admissible to show the presence of intent and the absence of accident; (4) the autopsy photographs were probative of the extent and severity of the decedent's injuries; (5) the instruction on the burden of proof on the involuntary manslaughter charge was proper; and (6) there was no conclusive evidence that the decedent's death was either premeditated, prolonged, or tortuous to warrant imposition of the death penalty under Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sought review of the judgment of the Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois), which dismissed his petition for review of an order of appellant Illinois Human Rights Commission for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The Commission's order, issued by a three-member panel, had dismissed with prejudice employee's complaint alleging that his termination by appellee employer had violated his civil rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, employee and Commission contended that an order by a three-member panel of the Commission was a final order reviewable by the appellate court. The court found, however, that to allow judicial review of three-member panel decisions of the Commission without first requiring that an aggrieved party file an application for rehearing by the entire Commission, and that the Commission deny that application, would thwart the legislative intent both to adopt the common law exhaustion of remedies doctrine in the Administrative Review Law, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 3-101 (1987), and to vest the Commission with the authority to decide all matters regarding civil rights violations under the Illinois Human Rights Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 68, para. 7-101 et seq. (1987). The court held, therefore, that an application for rehearing was required pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 68, para. 8-107(F) (1987), before a party aggrieved by a Commission decision could obtain judicial review. The court declined to give the judgment only prospective application because employee's and Commission's claim that employee had not had a fair opportunity to argue the merits of his case was absurd.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 105-1.01 et seq. (1979). The appellate court held that defendant did not have notice of a hearing and was denied procedural due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found to be a sexually dangerous person. The trial court granted a conditional release to defendant, who moved to Colorado where he was directed to live near his brother. After two years, defendant's counsel filed a petition seeking defendant's discharge. Three days later, defendant was charged in Colorado with committing a sexual assault. The state filed a motion to revoke the conditional release. The trial court ordered a public defender to notify defendant of a hearing on the motion, which defendant failed to attend. The trial court revoked the release and recommitted defendant to prison. The appellate court entered an order reversing the revocation. The court affirmed the order because there was no evidence that defendant was notified of the revocation hearing as required by &sect; 9 of the Act and &sect; 5-6-4 of the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-6-4 (1979). Thus defendant's due process rights were denied. The court also held that: (1) the trial court had jurisdiction and authority under the Act to grant a revocation order based on defendant's offense in Colorado; (2) defendant waived his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged the decision of the Appellate Court for the Second District (Illinois) that reversed the trial court's grant of judgment on the pleadings to the city in appellee developer's action for a declaration that certain increased building permit fees did not apply to the developer's project.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer argued that the increased fees were enacted because the developer had prevailed in previous litigation against the city concerning the project. The court disagreed and reversed the decision of the appellate court. The court noted that the purpose of charges such as building permit fees were to help defray the cost the city had for providing services to the developer and that it was not uncommon for the city to raise those fees when the cost of providing services rose. Therefore, absent some proof on the part of the developer that the city's action in increasing building permit fees and other construction costs was improper, the developer had no right to lower fees. The court found that, despite the seemingly purposeful timing of the fee increase, there was nothing in the record to show that the city used the higher fees to discriminate against or defraud the developer. The court held that there was no proof of a causal connection between the higher fees and the improper denial of developer's request for rezoning, or the judgment rendered against the city in that case. Therefore, the court saw no reason to declare that the city's higher fees were improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of armed violence, predicated on the felony of intimidation, and attempted armed robbery. The trial judge entered judgment on the more serious charge, armed violence, and sentenced defendant to seven years' imprisonment. The appellate court reversed the conviction, holding that intimidation could not have served as the predicate felony for armed violence because the existence of different penalties for offenses based on the same conduct resulted in an unconstitutionally disproportionate sentencing scheme. The state petitioned for leave to appeal pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 315(a) (107 Ill. 2d R. 315(a). The court reversed the appellate court's judgment. Intimidation was not a less serious offense than attempted robbery, nor was the commission of intimidation while armed a less serious offense than attempted armed robbery. Thus, defendant's argument that identically classified offenses may not be enhanced by the same circumstances to offenses of different classifications lacked merit. Having failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality, the court declined to interfere with the sentencing classifications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants had been convicted of committing a felony against a person under the age of 12. They appealed the affirmance of their respective enhanced sentences by the Appellate Court for the Third District and Appellate Court for the Fifth District (Illinois) contending that in cases in which the age of the victim was an element of the offense, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 38, par. 1005-5-3.2(b)(3)(i) constituted an impermissible double enhancement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue of these consolidated appeals was whether a victim's age may be considered as an aggravating factor under &sect; 1005-5-3.2(b)(3)(i) where the victim's age was also an element of the offense for which the defendant's were being sentenced. The court held that it could not, and affirmed in part and reversed in part. In reviewing the scope of &sect; 1005-5-3.2(b)(3)(i) the court found it to be ambiguous. The legislature, by establishing specific offenses in cases where the victim was under 13 years of age, had already made the youth of the victim an element of the offense. The court ruled that the application of the rule of lenity was appropriate and held that the age of the victim should not be considered for the imposition of an additional penalty, where the penalty for the underlying offense had already been enhanced based on the age of the victim. The court determined that each case should be remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Will County (Illinois), which convicted him of felony murder, Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions because it determined that it was not necessary to remand the case for a hearing in light of Batson regarding whether blacks had been improperly excluded from the jury because defendant had been convicted originally two years before Batson was decided. The court determined that the sentencing judge did not err in refusing to excuse three venireperson for cause because the determination of whether or not to allow a challenge for cause was within the sound discretion of the trial judge. The court found that even if evidence of a juvenile delinquency adjudication was improperly admitted, its admission was harmless because the state had also established that defendant had two prior felony convictions. The court found that the prosecutor's comments about the victim of a 1966 incident were invited because defense counsel first made a comment about the victim in his closing statement. The court determined that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel because counsel's strategic decisions were entitled to deference.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of murder and aggravated criminal sexual assault. Defendant then filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied. Defendant elected sentencing by the trial court and not by a jury and at sentencing the trial court imposed a death sentence. Defendant challenged both his conviction and his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court's conclusion that defendant's confession was voluntary was not against the weight of the evidence and the totality of the circumstances showed that the statements were voluntary. The court next held that the State's failure to call certain witnesses at the suppression hearing was not plain error. The court also held that evidence showed, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant acted with the mental state necessary to sustain a murder conviction. The court determined that the criminal sexual assault statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-13 (1985), and the aggravated criminal sexual assault statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-14 (1985), did not violate due process. The court held that it was error for the trial court to consider the victim impact statement in this case. The court decided that the extensive statement admitted and the trial court's statement that it expressly considered the victim impact statement in sentencing defendant to death established that the court could not have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the trial court's decision to impose the death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and vacated the sentences imposed and remanded the case back to the trial court for resentencing in front of a different trial court judge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his murder conviction and the death sentence imposed by the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois). Defendant claimed he was denied his constitutional right of confrontation under U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV, and that the Illinois death penalty statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1 (1981), was invalid under U.S. Const. amends. VIII, XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for murder and the death sentence imposed. The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence. The court held that the jury properly considered evidence of two unrelated murders as relevant to the issues of intent, design, and knowledge, because there were substantial similarities among the three crimes. The court ruled that the state properly elicited from the defendant information that he had acknowledged to authorities his participation in 16 different murders before the time he said he was beaten because such testimony tended to cast doubt on defendant's claim that his statements were coerced. The court held that defendant was not denied his right to confrontation when the state introduced testimony that a codefendant had implicated defendant because no objection was raised by defendant and such was consistent with the theory of defense. The court ruled that the jury's determination of the felony murder circumstance did not undermine the reliability of the eligibility determination. The court held that the Illinois death penalty statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1 (1981), was not invalid under U.S. Const. amends. VIII, XIV.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which was entered after a jury trial, that convicted defendant of murder, kidnapping, aggravated kidnapping, unlawful restraint, and concealment of a homicidal death, in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 9 -- 1(a)(1), 10 -- 1(a)(3), 10 -- 2(a)(3), 10 -- 3(a)(9), and 9 -- 3.1(a), and imposed the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's victim was a young male prostitute. Defendant dismembered the boy, placed his body parts in garbage bags, and put the bags in a dumpster. The court found sufficient evidence to prove defendant guilty of murder, including (1) that defendant was often seen at his apartment with young males, (2) the physical evidence, (3) defendant's fingerprints on the garbage bags, and (4) the testimony of witnesses. The court held that a jury could find defendant guilty of aggravated kidnapping because (1) the boy's confinement was not incidental to the murder, (2) the boy was induced to go from one place to another by deceit or enticement, and (3) the boy was confined against his will because his wrists were bound. The court also held that defendant was not entitled to a Franks hearing and that the search warrant was supported by probable cause. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in allowing expert testimony based on the supergluing technique of lifting fingerprints and expert testimony on electrophoretic testing of dried bloodstains was admissible. There were no mitigating factors and the imposition of the death penalty by the circuit court was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court of La Salle County (Illinois) of murder, armed robbery, residential burglary, and burglary. The jury found that there existed one of the aggravating factors and that there were no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude a sentence of death. The trial court sentenced defendant to death and consecutive terms of imprisonment. Defendant's sentence of death was stayed pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stalked and murdered an 86-year-old man and burglarized his home. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence several pieces of mail that defendant, while in custody in Maryland, sent to his brother, that tape recorded conversations of defendant with an informer should have been suppressed, and that testimony in the aggravation hearing that defendant was seen with a box containing &quot;white powder&quot; in his possession, apparently to suggest possession of drugs, was unreliable as evidence. The court affirmed. Whatever probative value the exhibits might have had was clearly outweighed by their prejudicial impact, and their admission was improper. However, given the fully convincing evidence of guilt, defendant was not denied a fair trial by the admission of the exhibits. Because the electronic eavesdropping was conducted legally outside of Illinois, the recording of defendant's statements was admissible. Given the strong evidence in aggravation and the slight mitigation, the isolated testimony about the purported drug possession did not so prejudice defendant as to deny a fair sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

The MRAI did not violate substantive due process because appellant had a compelling interest to intercede on the behalf of minors who were absent from home without parental consent and was narrowly tailored to achieve appellant's purposes. The court also held that the MRAI did not violate procedural due process and was not void for vagueness. Finally, the MRAI survived strict scrutiny and did not violate equal protection because parents under the MRAI could be treated differently because they were not similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 38, para. 10 -- 5(b)(10) (1987). The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) declared the statute unconstitutional because it relieved the state of its burden of proof as to one of the elements of the offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testimony showed that defendant approached a game room and asked two boys if they would have helped him unload some newspapers that were in a nearby alley. The boys agreed and went with defendant in his car to the alley. During the ride the defendant offered to pay them each $ 5.00 for their help. While waiting, defendant told the boys that he was going to move their seat back. In his attempt to do so, his hand touched one of the boy's private parts. The boy pushed the defendant's hand away. Defendant then claimed that he wanted to fix the seatbelt and he briefly placed his elbow on the same boy's groin area. Defendant then said that he would have paid them $ 5.00 if they would let him suck them. The two boys left the car and ran across the street to a policeman. The policeman had been watching the truck. The trial court found that the statute was unconstitutional and the state appealed. The court reversed the trial court and held that defendant did not have standing to challenge the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state constitution required direct review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which imposed the death sentence upon defendant after he pleaded guilty to armed robbery, aggravated arson, four counts of concealment of homicidal deaths, and nine counts of murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to armed robbery, aggravated arson, concealment of homicidal deaths, and murder. Three days later, defendant made a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas, and the court denied the motion. After the death penalty was imposed, the court on direct review vacated the judgment and remanded the case. The court found that although defendant was informed that the death penalty was the maximum sentence, the trial court did not properly admonish defendant of the minimum sentence prescribed by law as required by Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 402. Nowhere in the record did the trial court inform defendant, before accepting his pleas, that the trial court had to sentence him, at a minimum, to mandatory natural life imprisonment. The court held, therefore, that the defendant did not make a knowing and intelligent decision to plead guilty. The court further held that because the trial court did not comply with the requirements of Rule 402, the denial of defendant's motion to withdraw his pleas was an abuse of discretion. The court held that defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated by a pretrial interrogation, which garnered evidence about a prior crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder of a fellow inmate and conspiracy by a jury in the Circuit Court of Livingston County (Illinois). The trial court, at a separate sentencing hearing, found that the necessary aggravating factors existed and that there were no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude the imposition of the death penalty, and sentenced defendant to death. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in sentencing him to death. The court affirmed the convictions but vacated the sentence and remanded. The trial court erred in its finding as to defendant's mental state at the time of the commission of the offense. Under the trial court's standard any prisoner who suffered from a paranoid personality disorder would be unable to plead or prove an extreme mental or emotional disturbance, because in the trial judge's opinion all inmates who had been before him suffered from a paranoid personality disorder. The trial court's statement demonstrated a prejudice against incarcerated defendants, rather than a reasoned and informed judgment based upon the evidence contained in the record. The trial court's belief was at odds with the unrebutted expert evidence that not all prisoners had paranoid personality disorders. Nevertheless, the trial court relied upon its irrelevant and unsupported assertion to deny defendant's motion for a new sentence and affirmed the death sentence. The trial judge's comparison was not an appropriate consideration nor did it insure rationality, consistency, and evenhandedness in the imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions but vacated the death sentence and remanded the cause to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, nonresidents of the city, and defendant park district appealed from the order of the Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois), which affirmed the trial court's holding that the park district was permitted to generate a profit by charging fees that exceeded its costs. The appellate court reversed the trial court's holding that the park district's practice of imposing higher mooring fees upon nonresidents was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nonresidents filed a class action challenging the park district's practice of charging mooring fees that exceeded the operation costs of its harbors and charging higher mooring fees to nonresidents. The trial court held that the park district was permitted to make a profit but that charging nonresidents higher fees pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 105, para. 333.23n(g) (1987) was unconstitutional. The appellate court upheld the trial court's holding that the park district had a right to make a profit but reversed its determination that &sect; 333.23n(g) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the language of &sect; 333.23n(g) did not limit the amount of fees that the park district was permitted to charge and that the language of &sect; 333.23r(l) indicated that the park district was to operate its harbors at a profit. The court found that the distinction between residents and nonresidents in &sect; 333.23(n)(g) did not violate equal protection because it reflected a reasonable approach to equitably distributing the costs of providing harbor facilities to residents who already supported the facilities through payment of taxes, and nonresidents, who did not.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's decision that the park district's practice of charging mooring fees in excess of the expenses and costs actually incurred was permissible. The court also affirmed the appellate court's conclusion that the park district's imposition of a surcharge upon nonresidents for mooring fees was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an argument, the defendant stabbed the victim in the chest, killing him.

The defendant sought review, and the appellate court affirmed the conviction, but vacated the sentence because of the possibility that the mother's statement was taken into account in assessing the sentence. The state sought review of the vacated sentence and the defendant sought review of the affirmed conviction. The court found that the trial court's verdict was not so unreasonable, improbable or unsatisfactory as to raise a doubt about defendant's guilt, that the victim's mother's statement was not improperly introduced, that the Bill of Rights for Victims and Witnesses of Violent Crime Act, Ill.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case involved several consolidated actions wherein the trial court issued judicial driving permits (JDP) to drivers whose licenses had been summarily suspended for driving under the influence of alcohol. The appellate court held that appellant secretary of state (secretary) lacked standing to challenge the decisions and dismissed the appeals. On review, appellee bar association argued that the secretary did not have standing to appeal a JDP order because his role in that proceeding was merely ministerial and administrative. However, the court found that the secretary's responsibility and interest in the JDP process and his broad authority in the Illinois Vehicle Code conferred on the secretary standing to appeal the order. Furthermore, the secretary demonstrated that his interest was to insure that the court strictly adhered to its statutory authority in granting JDPs. Therefore, the court reversed the appellate court decisions and remanded the cases with directions to proceed in accordance with the opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellate courts' decisions that denied appellant secretary of state (secretary) standing in judicial driving permit cases were reversed.

The court held that the provision was unconstitutional and denied the state's motion for a supervisory order. Under the statute, the videotaped testimony was admissible only if the witness was available to testify at trial; defendant was not permitted to cross-examine the witness during the videotaping, but must be permitted to do so at the trial; and during the videotaping, the witness and defendant were physically present in the same room and could see and hear each other. Such testimony was an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted and as such was not have been admissible under the state or federal rules of evidence. The statute, by prohibiting contemporaneous cross-examination, unnecessarily and impermissibly infringed on an accused's right of confrontation. The challenged statute frustrated the truth-seeking function of the confrontation clause because too much time would pass between the videotaping and trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) jury found defendant guilty of murder, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9--1(a)(1) (1981), attempted murder, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 8--4 (1981), aggravated battery, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12--4(a) (1981), and attempted armed robbery, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 8--4 (1981). He appealed his convictions and sentences including death under Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found statutory aggravating factors and no mitigating circumstances. The court held (1) the appearance a physician who treated a victim would not have changed the trial's outcome, and the victim's inconsistencies were not so severe as to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial, (2) it could not conclude that counsel's performance failed to meet reasonable professional standards, and even if it so concluded, any defects in counsel's performance were not so severe as to demonstrate a reasonable probability of a different result absent the defects, (3) the prosecutor's closing arguments were not so prejudicial as to deprive defendant of a fair trial, (4) it could not say that an irrelevant 1969 killing and unreliable testimony concerning it were excluded from consideration as they should have been, (5) the state waived its argument that defendant's objection to its exercise of peremptory challenges was untimely, (6) the trial court should not have gone beyond the record to determine the race of two disputed venirepersons, and (7) the trial court must make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law for each strike complained of after a Batson hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the death sentence and conditionally vacated the convictions and non-death sentences, and remanded the cause to the trial court for new findings and conclusions for the Batson hearing. If the trial court found that the state failed to rebut the prima facie case, a new trial shall be ordered. If retrial was not required, the convictions and non-death sentences will be reinstated, and a new sentencing hearing conducted.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sentenced him to 15 years' imprisonment for rape, 6 years' for deviate sexual assault, and 7 years for burglary.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, burglary, rape, and deviate sexual assault by a jury and sentenced to death by a jury. In his direct appeal, this court affirmed his convictions and sentences. The Supreme Court denied his petition for writ of certiorari. Defendant then filed a petition under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 122 (1985), and counsel was appointed for defendant. Without an evidentiary hearing, the trial court dismissed the petition at the request of the State. The appeal concerned the correctness of that dismissal. The court held that the defendant had the burden of proof of establishing a substantial deprivation of rights under the U.S. Const. or the Ill. Const. The court further held that dismissal of nonmeritorious petitions on motion was certainly within the contemplation of the Post-Conviction Hearing Act and was necessary to the orderly and expeditious disposition of those motions. The court further found that the trial court was correct in refusing to recuse himself for his involvement in a murder case where defendant pled guilty at the age of sixteen while the judge was a state's attorney.</SPAN></P>

Sup. Ct. R. 401(a), 107 Ill. 2d R. 401(a) despite an incorrect admonishment that the minimum sentence was 20 years in prison, (2) a police officer's testimony regarding defendant's statements made in possible violation of his right to counsel was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, (3) defendant's vagueness challenge to an aggravating factor, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9 -- 1(b)(7) (1983), relating to the murder of a child under 12 years of age, was of no consequence because the jury found that defendant was independently eligible for the death penalty under another aggravating factor arising from his prior conviction of intentional murder, and (4) the death penalty statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the circuit court of possession of a stolen motor vehicle, and he appealed. The appellate court vacated the conviction, holding that &sect; 4-103(b) of the Illinois Vehicle Code violated the due process and proportionate penalty clauses of the Illinois Constitution. The State appealed. The court found that &sect; 4-103(b) was constitutional, reversed the appellate court, and reinstated the conviction. The court held that the appellate court erred in looking beyond the plain meaning of &sect; 4-103(b) and in concluding that the legislature intended to deter only organized motor vehicle thieves because a reading of the plain language made it clear that the legislature intended to prohibit all persons, not just organized motor vehicle thieves, from possessing stolen motor vehicles. Therefore, the appellate court erred in determining that possessors of stolen motor vehicles were punished more severely than organized motor vehicle thieves.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of an order from the Appellate Court for the Fifth District (Illinois), which reversed defendant's convictions for nine counts of automobile title fraud in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 4-105(a)(5). The State argued that the appellate court erred when it held that &sect; 4-105(a)(5) prohibited false statements only on the application for certificate of title.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of nine counts of automobile title fraud in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 4-105(a)(5). A lower appellate court reversed the convictions after finding that &sect; 4-105(a)(5) prohibited false statements only on the application for certificate of title and not on the required documents that accompanied the application. Upon review, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court determined that the indictment against defendants was sufficient because it apprised defendants of the precise offense charged and defendants could plead their conviction as a bar to future prosecution arising from the same conduct. The court found that there was sufficient evidence that defendants intended to defraud where the evidence established that the mileage listed on the titles was knowingly less than the mileage on the vehicles. The court concluded the convictions that were based upon false mileage statements that were made before the passage of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 3-112(a) (1985) could not stand because the mileage information was not material as such information was not required until the statute went into effect.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that he was entitled to a hearing to determine whether he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to have effective assistance of counsel at the sentencing stage of his trial. The court held that defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to call defendant's father to testify at the sentencing hearing and the trial counsel did not act unreasonably when he did not call three vulnerable witnesses to testify on defendant's behalf. The court further determined that in light of all of the mitigating circumstances that defendant's trial counsel brought to the jury's attention, it could not have concluded that the counsel's conduct was outside the broad range of competent assistance. The court also held that the jury instructions that were challenged by defendant did not result in prejudicing defendant. Defendant did not properly challenge the issue and was barred from raising the issue on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Illinois Department of Registration and Education (department) challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which found that the Medical Practice Act of 1987, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 4400 -- 1 et seq. (1987), which provided for the licensure of doctors of medicine, unconstitutionally deprived appellee naprapath of a property right in the practice of the profession without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The naprapath filed an application with the department for a license to practice medicine without drugs or operative surgery. The department informed the naprapath that her application had been denied as a matter of law because the licensure of naprapaths was not considered under existing law. The court found that the appellate issues were: (1) whether the Medical Practice Act of 1987 (act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 4400 -- 1 et seq. (1987), deprived naprapaths of their property right in the practice of naprapathy without due process of law; (2) whether the act violated federal and state equal protection guarantees; and (3) whether the act abridges a patient's right to choose a mode of treatment. The court answered each issue against the naprapath and reversed the lower court. The right to pursue a profession was not a fundamental right for due process purposes and legislation infringing upon that right need only be examined under the rational basis test. The act bore a rational relationship to a proper legislative purpose. The state had a legitimate interest in regulating medical professionals, through licensure, in order to protect the public welfare.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's judgment, finding that it had erroneously rule in favor of the naprapaths. The Medical Practice Act of 1987 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two co-defendants were tried together and were found guilty of many crimes that included murder, attempted murder, and home invasion. The jury found that defendants were eligible for the death penalty, and found there were no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude imposition of the death penalty. Both defendants appealed and raised several issues. One defendant raised the fact that his non-testifying co-defendant's statement was admitted against him. The judge instructed the jury not to consider the confession as to the testifying co-defendant and only to use it against the non-testifying co-defendant. The court held that the instruction was not sufficient. The court reasoned that because one co-defendant testified, the other co-defendant was able to cross-examine him regarding the part that coercion may have played in obtaining his confession. Because the one co-defendant did not testify, the testifying co-defendant's claim of coercion was undercut by his inability to confront the non-testifying co-defendant regarding the accusations contained in his statement.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 111, paras. 4460, 4464 (1985, repealed 1987).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant assisted with the delivery of a baby as a midwife at the parents' request.

Rev. Stat. ch. 111, paras. 4460 and 4464 (1985, Repealed 1987). The trial court dismissed the manslaughter charge and convicted defendant of practicing midwifery without a license and the appellate court reversed defendant's conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court's judgment, finding that the statute was vague in that it did not define the terms &quot;practice&quot; and &quot;midwifery.&quot; The court held that without the definitions of those terms, the statute did not provide a sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct so that a person of ordinary intelligence had a reasonable opportunity to know what was prohibited. Since it was unclear whether unlicensed persons were prohibited from assisting with births or from delivering babies, the court held that it violated the Due Process Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, four chief judges, brought an original action for a writ of prohibition or mandamus against respondent, a state labor relations board (the Board), concerning labor law issues. Three Illinois counties and two labor organizations intervened as respondents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question for the court was whether given their statutory role in funding the circuit courts, counties were to be considered joint employers of those courts' nonjudicial employees for purposes of collective bargaining. The four chief judges contended that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the counties said to be joint employers of court employees in four pending actions over which they presided. The court concluded that the Board could not constitutionally apply a test of joint-employer status so as to result in classifying counties as joint employers with chief judges concerning court employees. The conclusion relied on traditional labor law principles with the scheme of the Illinois Constitution's unified court system and separation of powers and with the nature of public-sector employment. The state, not a county, was the sole employer of all court employees. Any conflict between traditional labor law principles and constitutional principles were resolved in favor of the latter. Treating county boards as joint employers with chief judges in respect of the nonjudicial employees of the courts unduly trenched on the separate and equal status of the judicial branch.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, was tried as an adult for first-degree murder and armed robbery under the &quot;automatic transfer&quot; provisions of the Juvenile Court Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 805 -- 4(6)(a) (1987). Defendant was acquitted of murder but convicted of robbery. Thus, the Act required that further proceedings be conducted under the Act, not the Unified Code of Corrections (Code). The state filed a motion to permit prosecution under the criminal laws. A juvenile judge ruled that further proceedings would be under the Act. The matter was transferred for &quot;disposition&quot; to a trial court judge, who sentenced defendant pursuant to the Code, holding that a portion of the Act was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court vacated and remanded, finding that the trial court's comments indicated that it was aware of the prior ruling and either chose to ignore its breadth or dispute jurisdiction. Also, the state's conduct evidenced &quot;judge shopping.&quot; The prior ruling was appealable, as it constituted a pronouncement, based upon the plain language of the statute, that the criminal prosecution had terminated. Therefore, the trial court should have declined to rule on the state's motion.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile judge had jurisdiction, and the order was appealable where it terminated the criminal prosecution prior to final judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of murder and felony murder in the course of aggravated kidnapping and sentenced to death.

The court declined to vacate the sentence because the trial court properly considered defendant's emotional disturbance as a mitigating factor, and there was nothing in the record to rebut the presumption that the trial court considered only relevant and competent evidence in sentencing defendant to death.

The adult bookstore argued that the provisions were unconstitutional under the First Amendment as prior restraints on speech. The court did not reach the question of whether the statute authorized a prior restraint. It found that the restriction regulated elements of both speech and nonspeech because obscene material was not protected speech under the First Amendment. The court did not dispute the state's police power to control the dissemination of obscenity. However, it found that the incidental restriction on protected speech resulting from the statute was far greater than was necessary to achieve the state's substantial interest in suppressing obscenity. The court did not need to reach the question of whether Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 37-1 (1985) was constitutional as applied to obscenity. However, it declared the one-year closure and bond provisions and the ex parte provisions of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 37-1 (1985) to be unconstitutional as applied to obscenity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the course of a juvenile proceeding, the trial court ordered that the minor's identity was to be protected and not published. Newspaper had learned of the minor's identity outside of the court proceedings through casual conversations with county officials and had published the minor's name. Thereafter, the trial court ordered that newspaper was banned from the proceedings unless its order prohibiting publication was complied with. On appeal, the state contended that the case was moot, that the order was not appealable and that the prohibition was constitutional. The court held that the case was not moot because newspaper was still subject to the order and thus the issues involved in the trial still existed. Because the substance of the order was injunctive, in that it imposed an interlocutory restraint upon publication, it was reviewable as an interlocutory injunctive order. Finding that the order constituted a prior restraint on newspaper's free speech rights, the court found that the Act was unconstitutional as applied by the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of Will County (Illinois), which found in favor of defendant and held unconstitutional Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, paras. 6-204(a)(1), 6-205(b)(2) (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty and was convicted of criminal sexual assault and aggravated criminal sexual abuse. Defendant's driver's license was suspended. The trial court held unconstitutional Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, paras. 6-204(a)(1), 6-205(b)(2) (1987), which provided that upon conviction of certain sex offenses, the offender's driver's license was subject to mandatory revocation. The issue on appeal was whether those statutory provisions violated defendant's right to due process of law. The court affirmed the decision and held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 6-205(a)(3) clearly reflected the legislature's intent that revocation be tied to offenses involving the use of a motor vehicle. Ch. 6-205(b)(2) was wholly inconsistent with that intent. Because a vehicle was not involved in any way in the commission of the offenses for which defendant was convicted, the revocation of his license had no relationship to the public interest in keeping the roads free of drivers that threaten the safety of others and drivers who abused the privilege to drive by doing so illegally.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision in favor of defendant because the challenged provision was an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of the state's police power in violation of the constitutional guarantee of due process. Keeping drivers off the roads who committed offenses not involving vehicles was not a reasonable means of ensuring that the roads were free of drivers who operated vehicles unsafely or illegally.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was sufficient evidence that defendant was a participant in brutal offenses and acted with reckless indifference to human life. The court noted that defendant could not show that there was a reasonable probability that, but for his counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability was defined by the court as a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. The same analysis was applied to allegedly improper evidence and prosecutorial misconduct. First, the court noted that defendant's counsel failed to object and preserve the issue for review. However, the evidence was not so prejudicial that it could be characterized as plain error. The court acknowledged the constitutionality of the Illinois death penalty statute and found that the crime merited the punishment imposed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, pars. 1005-6-1(d) (1985) of the Unified Code of Corrections unconstitutional. Appellant State sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found that &sect; 1005-6-1(d) violated equal protection guarantees and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had pled guilty to reckless driving pursuant to a plea agreement. About two and one-half years later, defendant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, improper lane usage, and driving while license was suspended. Under &sect; 5-6-1(d), the trial court was not authorized to impose supervision where defendant, within the last five years, had pleaded guilty to reckless driving under a plea agreement. The trial court held that the statute violated equal protection guarantees because defendants who had pled guilty to a reckless driving were treated differently than those who entered a blind plea of guilty to reckless driving. On appeal, the court reversed, noting that the equal protection clauses of neither the Federal nor State constitutions prevented the State from treating different classes of people in different ways and that a person who has plea bargained to a charge of reckless driving was in a different position from a person who has entered a blind plea to such charge. The court held that &sect; 5-6-1(d) was rationally related to the state's legitimate goal of promoting highway safety and did not violate equal protection guarantees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant litigants sought review of judgments of the Appellate Courts for the First District and for the Second District (Illinois), which denied their pretrial motions for summary judgment and granted appellee claimants' motions for voluntary dismissal pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2, &sect; 1009(a) (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The litigants alleged that their summary judgment motions should have been heard in advance of the motions for dismissal and that the court should adopt Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a), which permitted voluntary dismissal only prior to the filing of an answer or motion by a defendant. The court held that &sect; 1009(a) was legislatively intended to allow the claimants to dismiss their suits without prejudice at any time before the trial began. Although it had concurrent jurisdiction and the authority to promulgate procedural rules, the court refused to get involved in the legislative process and unequivocally alter the statutory protection by adopting the federal rule. The statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it did not confer a benefit or impose a hardship upon an individual at the expense of others who were similarly situated. Frequent abuses of the statute prompted the court to rule that effective as of the date of the opinion and prospectively, the trial court could hear and decide a motion which had been filed prior to a &sect; 1009 motion when that motion, if favorably ruled on by the court, could result in a final disposition of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged along with a co-defendant with the murders of three teenage males. He was found guilty and sentenced to death. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), denied his petition challenging his conviction and sentence under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 122-1 et seq. (1985), without a hearing. The petitioner claimed ineffective assistance of counsel at the trial and sentencing stages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner claimed that his defense counsel erred by antagonizing the jury in his opening statement, presenting a weak and incoherent closing argument, and failing to &quot;life-qualify&quot; the jury during voir dire. The court held that the standards for determining whether petitioner had received effective assistance of counsel at trial or at the death penalty hearing was whether: (1) his counsel made errors so serious, and his performance was so deficient, that he was not functioning as the &quot;counsel&quot; guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and (2) those deficiencies so prejudiced the petitioner as to deprive him of a fair trial, a trial whose result was reliable. The court held that the petitioner failed to show that the state's evidence was insufficient or that he was prejudiced by the trial strategy of his counsel. The court concluded, however, that the decision of counsel not to use mitigating witnesses in the sentencing stage just because the witnesses approved of the death penalty in appropriate situations might have been a departure from professional norms, which could not be attributed to a reasonable trial strategy and required reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court in part, but reversed and remanded on the argument that counsel was ineffective at the sentencing stage by not using mitigating witnesses. The circuit court was directed to hold a hearing to determine whether there was a reasonable probability that the jury would have concluded that the factors did not warrant death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first defendant appealed from the order of the Appellate Court for the Fifth District (Illinois) ruling that Ill.

The second defendant appealed from the order of Circuit Court of Knox County (Illinois) denying his motion to commute his sentence and ruling that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-1(f) (1983) was unconstitutional. The appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first defendant filed motions under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-4(a), requesting modification of his state sentence to run concurrently with the federal sentence. The motions were denied, and the appellate court ruled that a portion of para. 1005-8-4(a) was unconstitutional. The second defendant filed a motion under para. 1005-8-1(f), seeking to have a state sentence commuted to time served while he was in federal custody. The trial court denied the motion and ruled that para. 1005-8-1(f) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that para. 1005-8-4(a) and para. 1005-8-1(f) were constitutional because they did not infringe upon any judicial authority in violation of the separation of powers doctrine. It was a proper exercise of the legislature's authority to revest a court with jurisdiction over a final order of sentence in special circumstances, and the subsequent imposition of a sentence in another jurisdiction was such a circumstance. The court remanded the second defendant's motion for modification of sentence for consideration because the trial court did not provide an alternative ground for his denial of the motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's order that had ruled that the statute permitting defendant to seek modification of sentence was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a second appeal in supplementary proceedings to discover assets under Ill. Code Civ. P., Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-1402 (1985), plaintiff, judgment creditor bank, challenged a decision by the Appellate Court for the Second District (Illinois) that the third-party citation respondent, a second bank, had a superior interest in stock that was the subject of the citation to discover assets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A debtor in default to the judgment creditor bank pledged stock as collateral to obtain new loans from the second bank. When the debtor defaulted to it too, the second bank foreclosed on the stock and notified the judgment creditor bank of its plan to sell it. Before it could so, however, the judgment creditor bank served it with a citation to discover assets pursuant to &sect; 2-1402, which contained language prohibiting the second bank from transferring or otherwise disposing of the debtor's property. The appeals court found that the citation to discover assets that was served upon the second bank was a wrongfully issued injunction that deprived the second bank of procedural due process. The court reversed because the citation did not constitute an injunction; it simply informed the citee of the penalties that could occur if it transferred or disposed of property belonging to the debtor. Nor did the record indicate that the second bank was deprived of due process. However, the court affirmed the determinations that the second bank had superior rights to the stock in question because it was secured, because they were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part and remanded. The court affirmed the appellate court's decision that the second bank possessed the superior interest in the stock. The court reversed the appellate court's holding that the citation was, in effect, an injunction that was wrongfully issued and that the second bank was entitled to damages.</SPAN></P>

The state appealed that ruling to the appellate court and the appellate court vacated the circuit court's judgment and remanded for further proceedings. The court reversed the lower court and held that the search was within the statute, and therefore the search was upheld.

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-6-1(d)(3) (1987), unconstitutional under the equal protection clauses of the United States and Illinois Constitutions. Defendant had entered guilty pleas on various driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) charges and asked for court supervision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute precluded court supervision as a sentencing alternative for DUI offenders who had, within five years, pled guilty to a charge of reckless driving. Defendant admitted that he was charged with DUI within five years and pled guilty. However, the court found that the record was not clear as to whether or not there was a plea agreement at that time. The state contended that the trial court had to find implicitly that defendant's prior plea of guilty was pursuant to a plea agreement. The court disagreed, as the court did not find any evidence that it could have been inferred that no plea agreement was involved. However, the court vacated the decision on the grounds that it did not have jurisdiction. The court stated that in criminal cases, there was no final judgment without a sentence. Because an appeal required a final judgment, and defendant was not sentenced in the underlying action, the court lacked jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The judge had accepted jury waivers submitted by the accused persons who were indicted under the Illinois Controlled Substance Act and denied the jury request by the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accused persons argued that Ill. Rev. Stat. 1ch. 38, para. 115 - 1(1987), which required the state also to waive jury trial in addition to the accused persons charged with a drug-related offense, violated the state's constitutional guarantee of the right to trial by jury. They contended that federal and state constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process were violated, and the statute, as applied to the accused persons, was an ex post facto law. The state countered the arguments, asserting that the right to a jury trial did not encompass the right to waive it. The court held that the statute deprived the accused persons of the full protection guaranteed under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The court ruled that the legislature could not deny the accused persons of any part of the constitutionally protected right short of any constitutional amendment to that effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the murder of his parents and three siblings and sentenced to death. The court affirmed, finding that the trial court exercised its sound discretion in refusing to grant defendant a surrebuttal argument because he pointed to no error of law or actual prejudice, and finding no error in its mention of another state's definition of extreme mental or emotional disturbance where it was referenced merely to give the term its plain, ordinary, commonsense meaning. The court agreed that there were no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude imposition of the death penalty where defendant's assertion that he suffered from extreme mental or emotional disturbance was contradicted by his methodical efforts to conceal the crimes and his calm manner with friends after the murders. Defendant's argument that he was motivated by a history of child abuse was inconsistent with the murders of his siblings and his demeanor during the confession was evidence of his lack of remorse. The court declined to reconsider the validity of Illinois' death penalty statute, which provided for adequate comparative review, and narrowing of the group of persons eligible for death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and death sentence for the murders of his parents and siblings was affirmed upon a finding that there were no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude imposition of the death penalty when defendant's methodical and calm manner during and after the murders belied his contention that he suffered from extreme mental or emotional disturbance and his demeanor during the confession was the best evidence of his lack of remorse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village passed an ordinance that regulated door-to-door solicitation of both a commercial and noncommercial nature. The ordinance classified solicitation of funds for charitable, religious, and political organizations under the noncommercial solicitation article of the ordinance. Solicitations for the sale of goods, books, magazines, or any other article or thing whatsoever, however, were classified as commercial. The ordinance required all commercial solicitors to pay a fee for a permit and limited the number of permits at any given time to 15. There was also a minimum five-day waiting period while a village official reviewed the permit application. After the police stopped its solicitors, the newspaper filed this action for injunctive relief and to have the ordinance declared unconstitutional. The court affirmed both lower courts and held that although the newspaper was a business, it was also a newspaper and therefore constitutionally protected by the first amendment in its right to sell and circulate its product on the same basis as religious, political, and charitable organizations.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the circuit court's decision that the Foreign Banking Office Act's imposition of the nonreciprocal license fee in &sect; 3 of the Act was void and unenforceable as violative of the supremacy clause.

Public Act 84 -- 1018.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers represented by a lodge had a collective bargaining agreement with the city. The agreement provided for leaves of absence without pay when running for public office. Officers, who were candidates for office, filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief arguing that Ill. Public Act 84 -- 1018 prohibited the city from restricting the political activities of their employees, and thus preempted the city's rule. The trial court agreed and enjoined its enforcement. The court of appeals disagreed and reversed finding the statute did not apply to the city and therefore had no effect on the police department's requirement. Officers appealed. The court found the appellate court correctly reasoned that an ordinance adopted by a home rule unit other than a division 1 or division 2.1 municipality would not be prohibited by the statute and therefore would not be inconsistent with it. The court further held that officers' new argument introduced a different theory of the case, one that was sharply at odds with their original theory, and therefore was waived for not having been preserved properly.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court dismissed plaintiff taxpayer's claim for lack of standing, but granted plaintiff candidate's motion for summary judgment on the basis of the statute's unconstitutionality. The court reversed the circuit court's order that declared the statute unconstitutional and defendant's appointment invalid. The court held that both plaintiffs had standing because their claim of injury to their voting right constituted an actual controversy. It was also held that the statute's placement of the right to fill legislative vacancies in the hands of a political party was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to private persons because the statute imposed a set of duties on political party committees that arguably conferred indicia of public agency on them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from the order of the Appellate Court for the Third District (Illinois), affirming the trial court's order, which granted defendant's post-conviction petition and vacated his conviction for aggravated arson under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 20-1.1(a)(1) (1981) on the ground that the statute had been declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court had not erred by vacating defendant's conviction. Generally, where the state supreme court had declared a statute invalid, it was null and void as of the date of its enactment, and as such, it conferred no rights, imposed no duties, and afforded no protection. It was void ab initio. In this case, the court had declared the aggravated arson statute unconstitutional and, as such, the doctrine of void ab initio was applicable. However, the state could proceed with an action against defendant under the amended arson statute pursuant to &sect; 3-5(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 3-5(a) (1987), which provided that a prosecution for arson could be commenced at any time. Defendant did not have a claim of double jeopardy because a substantive amendment to an unconstitutional statute could not have retroactive application and as such did not in legal contemplation exist at the time of the offense. Defendant also did not have an ex post facto claim because the amended statute was inapplicable and defendant knew that his conduct was prohibited and that he would be punished for his actions.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 43, para. 93.9 et seq. (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The distributor filed an action challenging the department's ruling that it, as a distributor of a low-alcohol-content beverage, had to pay taxes on that beverage based solely on the method of production of the alcohol it contained. The court found that the distributor's products should be taxed at the same rate as wine and wine coolers, not at the rate that was over eight times higher. The taxation of the distributor's products at the higher rate violated the constitutional guarantees of uniformity under Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 (1970), because there was no real and substantial difference between the distributor's products and wine coolers. Where the products were virtually identical save for the method of production of their alcoholic content, they could not constitutionally be taxed differently. Therefore, the court held that the distributor's products had to be taxed by the department at the same rate established administratively for wine coolers. To the extent that &sect; 8--1 of the Act, codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 43, para. 95.03 (1985), did not establish a basis on which to tax such virtually identical products equally, the court declared it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

In so holding, the court found that (1) even accepting that the attorney's actions or inactions constituted error, defendant was not prejudiced because the uncontroverted evidence against the defendant supported the conviction, (2) even assuming that the analysis for arsenic poisoning was unreliable, it was not probable that the information would have changed the result on retrial as the case against defendant was essentially a circumstantial one in which no one piece of evidence convinced the jury, and (3) the Lake County circuit court had not erred in denying defendant's post-conviction petition without an evidentiary hearing because defendant failed to make the requisite substantial showing of a violation of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murdering 33 boys and young men and received the death penalty. His convictions and sentences were affirmed and his writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found no merit in any of defendant's allegations. The court found that the standard for ineffective assistance at a sentencing hearing is the two-prong standard under Strickland, in which the defendant must prove: that his counsel's representation was so deficient that his counsel was not functioning as the &quot;counsel&quot; guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment; and that this deficient performance so prejudiced the defendant as to deprive him of a fair hearing. The burden of proving incompetence, and of overcoming the presumption that an attorney's decision is the product of &quot;sound trial strategy,&quot; rests upon the defendant, not the state. Defendant's trial counsel presented evidence in mitigation during his trial. The court held that defendant did not adequately allege prejudice. The Strickland standard requires a reasonable probability of a different result, not merely a possibility. The court also found that defendant failed to make a substantial showing of a violation of his constitutional rights sufficient for an evidentiary hearing, and that it was not unreasonable for defense counsel to decide not to seek sequestration of the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist filed a request to rescind the State's summary suspension of his driver's license for driving under the influence of alcohol. The trial court granted the motorist's request. The appellate court affirmed. The court held that a driver who suffered the summary suspension of his license had the burden of proving that the suspension should be rescinded. On balance the court determined that placing the burden of proof upon the suspended motorist did not violate the Due Process Clause of either the federal or state Constitutions. However, the State had the burden of showing the reliability of test results if the motorist first made a prima facie showing that the results were unreliable. The court's holding considerably reduced the risk that placing the initial burden of proof upon all suspended motorists would result in the erroneous deprivation of any one motorist's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments of the trial and appellate courts were reversed, and the case was remanded with direction that the summary suspension of motorist's driver's license be reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the unlawful possession of weapons on school grounds. Pursuant to the automatic transfer provision of the Juvenile Court Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, par. 702 -- 7(6)(a) (1985), defendant's case was transferred to criminal court so that he could have been prosecuted as an adult. Following a hearing, the trial court held that the automatic transfer provision was unconstitutional. The state directly appealed. On appeal, defendant argued that the automatic transfer provision was invalid because it deprived him of due process and equal protection of the laws. The court noted that courts have routinely held that age was not a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis, and thus the rational basis standard applied. The court held that even if the classification resulted in some inequality, it was not unconstitutional because it was rational for the legislature to conclude that juveniles that were charged with unlawful use of weapons on school grounds posed the greatest threat to the school environment. The court thus reversed the trial court's decision and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for murder after witnesses saw him fatally stab his wife. Following a jury trial, defendant was found guilty but mentally ill (GBMI).

The state filed a petition for leave to appeal. The state contended that defendant waived the issue of error, the instructions were harmless, and the modifications were necessary to avoid constitutional infirmities. The court affirmed the appellate court's decision because the trial judge's modification of the GBMI instruction conflicted with the unambiguous &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; language of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115 -- 4(j) (1985). The court held that (1) defendant did not waive the issue by failing to raise it in his post-trial motion because the misstated instruction was worthy of review; (2) the modification was not harmless because it probably affected the outcome; and (3) the modification could not be construed to interpret &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; as meaning &quot;by a preponderance of the evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the trial court's ruling that the statute that permitted the state to request the substitution of the trial judge was unconstitutional. The court noted that the trial court declared the statute unconstitutional as a violation of the separation of powers clause of Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 (1970), and interfered with the judicial powers granted under Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 7(c), 16. The court reversed and remanded and noted that while all legislation carried a strong presumption of constitutionality, the legislature was not permitted to enact statutes that solely concerned court administration or the day-to-day business of the court. But the legislature was permitted to enact legislation that complemented the authority of the judiciary. The court noted that Ill. Rev.

The board appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the amendments violated Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7(a),which prohibited the election of circuit judges in such a manner. The legislature could not require the additional qualification that a candidate reside in a particular part of the unit which selected the judge and Article VI could not be viewed as a grant of power to add such qualifications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The city and city council claimed that the associations did not have standing to complain about the action taken by the city. The court affirmed the trial court's order and held that all but one of the associations did not have standing to bring their claims against the city, as they lacked a sufficient interest in the status of the building as a landmark, but the remaining association had standing under &sect; 468C of the Historic Sites, Buildings, and Antiquities Act, specifically at 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 468C, because it was authorized to sue to carry out the function established for it by Congress under 16 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 468-468e.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee claimant had filed a complaint charging appellant, the Chicago Transit Authority, with negligence and wilful and wanton misconduct. The claimant alleged that, as a result of the authority's driver's inaction, he was severely beaten by the other passengers and suffered permanent injuries. The authority had moved to dismiss the complaint, claiming that the action was barred by Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 111 2/3, par. 327, which absolved the authority of liability in tort for criminal acts of third parties. The circuit court denied the authority's motion and held the statute invalid. The court stated that the authority was created by statute as a municipal corporation for the purpose of owning and operating a public transportation system whose function was to provide transportation to the public at large, rather than to guarantee the safety of every individual passenger and complete uniformity between the immunity given to it and municipal entities whose primary purpose was to protect citizens from crime, was not required.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Amendments to both the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 440 et seq. (1985), and the Use Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 439.1 et seq. (1985), established a different tax rate for sales of gasohol containing ethanol, which was distilled in Illinois or in a state which offered Illinois reciprocal tax benefits and changed the definition of &quot;gasohol.&quot; On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the statutes violated the commerce clause because on their face and in plain effect they discriminated against interstate commerce in favor of local interests. The statutes legislated expressly in terms of state boundaries giving tax preference to gasohol containing Illinois distilled ethanol. The amended definition of &quot;gasohol&quot; was invalid because it discriminated against and unduly burdened interstate commerce in that virtually no in-state ethanol producers were excluded from the tax benefit while a significant portion of out-of-state producers were excluded. The allowance of a tax benefit for gasohol without regard to the raw materials in the ethanol used would have had the same effect of encouraging the use of gasohol without its discriminatory effect.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and found that the last legislative act necessary so that the bill could become law took place on November 1, 1983, when the senate voted to accept the governor's recommendations for change. Thus, for the purpose of Ill. Const. of 1970 art. IV, &sect; 10 the bill was &quot;passed&quot; on November 1, 1983.

The amendment of former &sect; 11--11 to include the terms &quot;stepfather or stepmother&quot; was not intended as a change to former &sect; 11--11 but to provide a fuller description of the group of persons to whom the statute was applicable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff health clubs appealed an order from the Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois), which held that an amendment to the Chicago Amusement Tax Ordinance, Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code &sect; 104-104-8 (1985) was constitutional. The health clubs' action had sought both to declare the ordinance unconstitutional and to obtain an injunction preventing defendant city from enforcing the amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amendment extended what the city termed an amusement tax to health clubs and racquetball clubs. The city contended that the amendment was properly enacted pursuant to its home rule power. The clubs contended, among other things, that the amendment was an &quot;occupation tax&quot;, which according to the Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(e) (1970), could not be enacted by a home rule unit without legislative authority. The court held that the amendment was in fact an occupation tax and that the city ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to health and racquetball clubs. The city's assertion that the tax could not be an occupation tax because it was assessed on the patrons of the club facilities was without merit. In fact, the clubs were responsible for assessing and collecting the tax. They were responsible for payment of the tax even if their patrons did not or refused to pay it and they were liable for substantial penalties for late payments of the tax. The tax was based on the occupation of the club owners. And, based on the wide variety of services the clubs provided, the tax could not be an amusement tax allowed under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, par. 11-42-5 (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's finding that the ordinance was constitutional. The court affirmed the circuit court's order that held the ordinance unconstitutional as applied to the health and racquetball clubs and that had entered a preliminary injunction preventing enforcement of the ordinance against the clubs.</SPAN></P>

He challenged the death sentence imposed by the trial judge. He claimed that the denials of motions for automatic substitution of judge and mistrial were error, that testimony was impermissible, and that the prosecutor's comments and his sentencing were improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a burglary, defendant stabbed a woman to death and brutally injured her husband. Defendant was convicted of murder, attempted murder, armed robbery, residential burglary, and aggravated battery. He waived his right to a jury for purposes of a death penalty hearing, and the trial judge sentenced him to death. Defendant petitioned for direct review. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 114--5(a) (1981) allowed defendant to seek substitution of judges only once during his trial. The trial court did not err in allowing the testimony of the victim despite his apparent lack of competence. Defendant was not denied his right to confront this witness. The value of the testimony outweighed whatever prejudicial effect it may have had. Defendant was not denied a fair trial by the prosecution's comments. The trial judge's decision to impose the death sentence was not excessive or disproportionate. The death sentencing scheme in Ill. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, director of the insurance company (director), filed a petition in separate liquidation proceedings. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) ordered that all claims against appellee reinsurers were claims of general creditors within the meaning of Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 817(1)(d).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to reinsurance agreements, the reinsurers contracted with other insurance companies to cover claims paid by those reinsureds on policies of direct insurance or reinsurance which the reinsureds issued to third parties. The resinsurer became insolvent and was placed into liquidation. Pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 805, the director acted as the liquidator of both reinsurers. Numerous reinsureds which had not been paid by the reinsurers under their reinsurance agreements timely filed claims with the director. Claims also were filed by other creditors of the reinsurers and other state guaranty funds. The court concluded that if the legislature had intended to include reinsurance agreements under priority in Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 817(1), it would have explicitly mentioned reinsurance agreements. However, because Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 817(1)(c) was limited to certain claims covered under insurance policies and insurance contracts and did not include claims under reinsurance agreements, the court held that all claims against the reinsurers were claims of general creditors under Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 817(1)(d).</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed the trial court's granting the injunction. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the appellate court applied a standard more demanding than that which was required. In order for a content-neutral zoning ordinance, which regulated adult uses to withstand constitutional scrutiny, the county was required to refrain from effectively denying the businesses a reasonable opportunity to operate. The ordinance did not have the effect of virtually banning adult uses. Evidence established that the ordinance provided the businesses with a reasonable number of suitable sites in which to relocate. Even though they might have been forced to expend a certain amount of money to relocate, they were affected no differently from any other commercial enterprise that suffered economic detriment as a result of land-use regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9 -- 1 (1985). The state requested the trial judge to conduct a death penalty hearing, believing that defendant was eligible for the death penalty on the basis of another conviction for murder in the State of Rhode Island. The trial judge refused to conduct a death penalty hearing and sentenced defendant to 40 years' imprisonment. The state sought a writ of mandamus and prohibition, or a supervisory order to compel the trial judge to vacate his orders. The court awarded the writ of mandamus. The first phase of a death sentencing hearing was never held, and the trial judge was without a basis to refuse to hold such a hearing. As a hearing was never held, defendant's double jeopardy rights would not be violated if a death penalty sentencing hearing were conducted. The evidence included a copy of the Rhode Island murder conviction. Rhode Island's murder statute, under which defendant was first convicted, was substantially similar to Illinois's murder statute for purposes of the multiple-murder aggravating factor in para. 9 -- 1(b)(3). Accordingly, the trial judge had no basis to refuse to conduct the hearing.</SPAN></P>

R. 103(b), 107 Ill. 2d 103(b). The trial court denied the motion, and the Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois) reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court agreed with the appellate court judgment, finding that nothing was more critical to the judicial function then the administration of justice without delay. In order to fulfill the mandate of rendering justice fairly and promptly and to comply with the language of Rule 103(b), the trial court had to consider the litigant's exercise of diligence regardless of whether the lack of diligence occurred in the original action or after refiling. A dismissal and refiling under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 13 -- 217 did not insulate the litigant from the lack of diligence displayed prior to dismissal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant firefighters' union appealed a judgment from the Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois) that reversed a trial court's decision and ruled that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2 -- 290.1 (1985) applied retroactively and that therefore plaintiff administrators' suits for damages for deaths and injuries suffered in fires were not barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrators sued the union for damages arising from the deaths and injuries suffered in fires that occurred during a strike called by the union in 1980. At the time the injuries occurred, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2 -- 290.1 (1985), which permitted voluntary, unincorporated associations to sue and to be sued in their own names, was not in effect. The trial court therefore granted the union's motion to dismiss on the grounds that, under the common law, a voluntary unincorporated association could not be sued in its own name in an action at law. The appellate court ruled that the statute applied retroactively and reversed the trial court. On appeal, the court reversed and ruled that the statute did not apply retroactively to causes of action that arose before the statute's effective date. The court ruled there was no express language or necessary implication in the statute that indicated clearly that the legislature intended a retroactive application. The court ruled that the statute was not merely a change in procedure or remedies and thus the presumption of prospectivity applied, a presumption which only the statute itself could, but failed to, rebut.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state directly appealed orders of the Circuit Courts of Cook and Dupage Counties, Illinois, that held that the state could not, consistent with the constitutional guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, U.S. Const., amends. I, XIV, proscribe defendants' knowing possession of child pornography in their homes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with possession of child pornography in violation of &sect; 11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-20.1(a)(2), and the law was declared unconstitutional by courts in two counties. In reversing and finding the statute constitutional, the court held that the state could, consistent with constitutional guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, proscribe the knowing possession of child pornography in the home. The constitution protected the right to receive information and ideas, and statutes regulating obscenity did not reach into the privacy of one's own home, but the state's interest in safeguarding the physiological and psychological well being was compelling. When a definable class of material bore heavily and pervasively on the welfare of the children involved in its creation and production, the balancing of competing interests was struck and the materials were without protection of the First Amendment. In prohibiting without restriction possession of child pornography, the legislature sought to remove the final link in the chain of distribution of such material.</SPAN></P>

The jury found no mitigating factors to preclude a sentence of death. The circuit court imposed the penalty of death and 60 years in prison for aggravated kidnapping. Defendant sought direct review of his death sentence. The court affirmed the conviction and the death sentence, but reduced the kidnapping sentence to 30 years. The court found no per se conflict in the new public defender's involvement with the case in the prosecutor's office.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed a clerk during a store robbery and after he was convicted of murder, felony murder, and armed robbery, he was sentenced to death. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that evidence of another armed robbery was highly relevant and thus admissible to determine defendant's identification. Although the trial court did err in admitting evidence of a third armed robbery, the admission of limited evidence did not require a reversal because defendant's conviction was not based on the error. Defendant failed to prove that the pretrial physical lineup procedure was impermissibly suggestive, and identification testimony at trial was admissible because it had independent origin in the witnesses' memories and was sufficient to leave no reasonable doubt as to defendant's guilt. The jurors were properly instructed regarding the other-crimes evidence when all of the instructions were viewed together, and there were no errors requiring reversal in the prosecution's argument. The court found no reversible errors in the sentencing phase of the trial because the evidence sufficiently supported the finding of a statutory aggravating factor and the lack of mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois dismissed appellant inmate's petition for post-conviction relief without an evidentiary hearing. Defendant had entered pleas of guilty to charges of murder, attempted murder, and armed robbery. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was sentenced to death. The convictions and sentences were affirmed and certiorari was denied and he then sought relief under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 122--1 et seq. The inmate contended that res judicata should not have applied because the instant claim was distinguishable from the claim raised on direct appeal. Any allegations relating to the inmate's subjective confusion or lack of understanding could have been supported by affidavits at the motion-to-vacate stage. Because they were not, the court found that the issue had been waived. The court concluded that the petition for post-conviction hearing and the documents filed in support of the petition did not make a substantial showing that the manner in which the prosecutorial discretion was exercised under our death penalty statute rendered the statute unconstitutional. The inmate failed to identify any authority indicating that any court had found the instant claim to be meritorious. He also failed to show that an Eighth Amendment violation had arisen in any of the several executions by lethal injection that had taken place in other jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 6-206.1 (1985), which authorized the issuance of judicial driving permits, violated the separation of powers doctrine of the state constitution. The court held that (1) the standard for judging the constitutionality of the statute was the rational basis test because the challenged classification did not affect a fundamental right or discriminate against a suspect class; (2) the statutory classification, which applied the implied-consent concept and statutory summary suspension only to persons driving on public highways, was rationally related to public safety and did not violate the equal protection guarantees of the state or federal constitutions; (3) although defendant had a property interest in her driver's license, she was not entitled to a hearing prior to its suspension; and (4) defendant, who was granted a judicial driving permit for work-related driving, lacked standing to challenge the validity of para. 6-206.1 because she was not prejudiced by the application of the provision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated actions, the state appealed a judgment of the Appellate Court for the Third District (Illinois), which affirmed the vacations of defendants' summary suspensions for driving under the influence of alcohol, under &sect; 11-501.1(d) of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501.1(d) (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendants were arrested, the arresting officers signed the police reports below a notation stating that they solemnly affirmed that the requirements of &sect; 11-501.1 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501.1 (1985), were met. Defendants each requested a judicial hearing be held before the effective date of the suspensions. The suspensions were vacated because the reports were not sworn to under oath. The appellate court affirmed. The court reversed and remanded the judgment. Although, &sect; 11- 501.1 was unconstitutional because driving privileges could be lost based on an unsworn report at a hearing, the temporary suspensions based on such reports did not violate procedural due process. An officer's good-faith failure to initially swear to a report was curable given the seriousness of the public hazard that summary suspensions addressed. The summary suspension provisions were to be liberally construed to protect public safety. No impropriety resulted from swearing to the reports at the hearings when the legislature intended suspension hearings to be expedited, and requiring prehearing amendments to the reports would delay the hearing dates.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that it could not say that no real present question involving actual interests and rights existed even if defendant's duties under the act were no longer controverted because the controversy could have been classified as being capable of repetition yet evading review. The court further determined that departing from the prevailing wage was beyond defendant's home rule unit authority because it directly affected matters and individuals that were outside defendant's boundaries. Establishing minimum requirements to attain the act's goals was traditionally a matter of state concern.</SPAN></P>

Finding no mitigating factors, the trial court sentenced the defendant to death for the murder convictions. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. With regard to the guilty phase, the court found that the state's use of a prior consistent statement was admissible to rebut the charge that the witness had a motive to fabricate the statement. Further, defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to call certain witnesses and regardless, counsel's performance was not prejudicial in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. With regard to the sentence phase, the note in the presentence report that defendant was hostile did not impermissibly refer to defendant's right to remain silent. Also, the judge was under no duty to inform the defendant that the jury's decision to impose the death penalty had to be unanimous; defendant knowingly and intelligently waived capital jury sentencing. Finally, defendant's sentence of death was not disproportionate to the life sentence his codefendant received given the fact that there was ample evidence that defendant was the trigger man.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois), which granted the state's motion to dismiss defendant's petitions for post conviction relief on the grounds that the issues raised were waived, barred by the application of res judicata, or insufficient to state a constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the defendant argued that: (1) his right to the effective assistance of counsel was violated during the post conviction proceedings; (2) the trial court err in dismissing his petitions without holding an evidentiary hearing on the allegations regarding prosecutorial discretion and the alleged racially discriminatory application of the death penalty statute; and (3) the alleged lack of guidelines relating to the method and manner of execution by lethal injection violated the Eighth Amendment. The court found that defendant was precluded from raising his ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Further, the court found that there was no basis to assume that defendant's death sentences were the product of racial bias, or wantonly and freakishly imposed. Thus, the trial court properly dismissed defendant's claim without an evidentiary hearing. Finally, the court found that the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 119 -- 5 (1983), set forth certain general guidelines relating to the method and manner of execution. Therefore, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 40, para. 1501(D)(f)) of the Illinois Adoption Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 40, para. 1501 et seq., because it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellant state filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of appellee parents, whose daughter was in foster care, the parents moved to strike the allegation that they were unfit parents under the Illinois Adoption Act (Act), Ill.

While the circuit court denied the motion, the appellate court reversed, holding that the parents were denied due process. The court affirmed the ruling, finding that &sect; 1(D)(f) of the Act did not satisfy the requirement of due process because it authorized the termination of parental rights upon proof of physical abuse by a preponderance of the evidence. The court held that the proper standard for termination of parental rights was clear and convincing evidence, as the lessor standard created a risk of error that rendered the proceeding unreliable. A second finding of abuse did not eliminate the risk of error, nor did it in itself constitute clear and convincing evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with 26 counts of possession of a motor vehicle certificate of title with incomplete assignment, in violation of &sect; 4-104 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 4-104 (1983) . The Appellate Court for the Third District (Illinois) affirmed the suppression of evidence of the incomplete titles because the evidence resulted from an illegal search and seizure. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented was whether, when police officers discovered evidence of a crime during the course of a lawful administrative inspection conducted pursuant to &sect; 5-403 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 5-403 (1983), the officers had to obtain a warrant before seizing the evidence. The State argued that the trial and appellate courts erroneously interpreted the warrant requirement of &sect; 5-403, and therefore the evidence seized by the officers should not have been suppressed. The court held that the plain language of the statute contemplated that officers should obtain a warrant before seizing any evidence discovered during the course of an inspection. Therefore, any evidence seized by police officers without a warrant during an administrative inspection under &sect; 5-403 was evidence seized outside the officers' limited authority under the statute and had to be excluded. The state statute imposed additional restrictions on the manner in which warrantless searches were to be conducted, and the court could not ignore the language of the statute or interpret it in such a way as to render the restrictions meaningless.</SPAN></P>

The victim sought and obtained counseling from a rape counseling program. Before trial, defendant issued a subpoena duces tecum on that organization seeking information regarding the victim. The circuit judge quashed the subpoena ruling that the communications between the counselor and the victim were protected from disclosure by Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 110, para. 8--802.1. The court held that defendant's request was merely general, however, and was not supported by any allegations that material useful to the defense of this case was likely to have been found in the files of the counseling program. The court also concluded that defendant's suggested procedure was not constitutionally required. Thus, the court concluded that defendant was not denied due process, nor was his confrontation right violated, by the trial judge's refusal in this case to conduct an in camera inspection of the victim's counseling records.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's execution was stayed pending direct review under Ill. Const. of 1970, art. VI, &sect; 4(b); 107 Ill. 2d R. 603, 609(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced him to death for murder, concealment of a homicidal death, and aggravated arson. The court considered several contentions on appeal, including some that defense counsel failed to raise in the post-trial motion. The court affirmed the murder and concealment sentences, but reversed the arson conviction. Defendant failed to show that his counsel was ineffective for not presenting mitigating evidence because the trial judge was aware of defendant's short criminal history, and the record contained no other mitigating evidence that counsel could have offered. The conviction of multiple murders, and because one victim was under 12 years old and was murdered in a brutal and heinous manner, was sufficient to establish aggravating circumstances. Further, the consideration of juvenile adjudications at capital sentencing proceedings was appropriate. The court reversed the conviction for arson because the statute was subsequently invalidated, but this did not change the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

In two instances the lower appellate court affirmed the trial court's decisions. In affirming in one case and reversing in two cases on appeal, the court held that (1) the denial of counsel in frivolous post-conviction proceedings did not conflict with court rules providing for the appointment of counsel in direct appeals because the provisions provided for appointment of counsel at different stages of the post-conviction process, (2) the right to counsel at post-conviction proceedings was a matter of legislative grace and did not conflict with judicially promulgated rules, (3) fundamental fairness did not require the appointment of counsel in post-conviction proceedings, (4) the defendants' rights to due process and equal protection were not violated, but (5) because the lower appellate court failed to rule on two of the petitions within the period required, the rulings were void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was seen walking the victim to her apartment and leaving later.

Defendant failed to file a post-trial motion as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 116-1. The court's review was thus limited to constitutional issues that had been raised at trial. The court held that confinement in the victim's apartment was sufficient to support aggravated kidnapping and partial disrobing was sufficient for attempted rape. Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel had to be considered in light of the overwhelming evidence against him. Thus, defendant could not show that but for the supposed errors of counsel the result would have been different. A battery of constitutional objections to the death penalty had previously been rejected. The convictions and sentences were therefore affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had attacked two correctional officers, killing one with a shank, while he was an inmate serving a 20-to-60-year term for an earlier murder conviction.

Stat. ch. 38, par. 5-2-6(b) (1983) provided that the court could impose any sentence upon defendant which could be imposed pursuant to law upon a defendant who had been convicted of the same offense without a finding of mental illness. That language left available for GBMI offenders the full range of sentences, including the death penalty, that could be imposed on persons who are guilty of offenses and who are not mentally ill. The court also determined that the sentence did not violate defendant's Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment rights. The court then concluded that evidence of defendant's mental illness was admissible at the capital sentencing hearing regardless of the relationship between the GBMI provisions and the statutory mitigating circumstance of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment from the trial court, which, after defendant pleaded GBMI to one count each of murder and attempted murder, sentenced defendant to death for the murder conviction and imposed a 30-year prison term for the conviction for attempted murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the probation officer's testimony at the death penalty hearing was inadmissible and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to it on grounds that it was prejudicial and inflammatory. After oral arguments were heard in defendant's case, the United States Supreme Court held in another case that victim impact evidence was not admissible at a capital sentencing hearing. The court, however, found that the only portion of the transcript of the sentencing hearing included in the record contained the probation officer's testimony. Without a more complete record, it was unable to ascertain the full effect of the presentation of the victim impact evidence, and of trial counsel's procedural default in failing to preserve the issue for review. The court also noted that the probation officer testified as to defendant's remorse and that she described favorable information that her presentence investigation had revealed concerning the defendant. Therefore the court held that application of the plain error standard to defendant's procedurally defaulted claims would deny the state's legitimate interest in the finality of the defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gasoline association argued that the ordinance was invalid because it contained an invalid delegation of the council's taxing power and because the fuel tax was an unauthorized occupation tax that violated the state constitution. The court concluded that the gasoline association failed to demonstrate that the vehicle fuel tax ordinance violated the state constitution or any state statute and affirmed the circuit court's judgment. The tax was not invalid because its real estate taxing provisions permissibly delegated the council's taxing power to the city comptroller. The ordinance merely involved a factual determination by the comptroller to calculate the revenues received by the city from the vehicle tax. The ordinance vested no discretionary powers in the comptroller. Likewise, the ordinance did not impose an impermissible tax upon occupations in contravention of the state constitution. The vehicle tax was substantially similar to other home rule taxes that had been upheld and was declared by the court to be a proper home rule tax.</SPAN></P>

The court found that a hearsay statement was properly admissible as a spontaneous declaration and that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel under Strickland. Defendant was not denied his right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend.

Defendant alleged that though the theft statute in question, Ill. Rev.

He claimed introduction of the prior conviction at his trial violated due process and unduly prejudiced the jury. The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment, holding that where a prior theft conviction elevates the offense from a misdemeanor to a felony, the prior theft conviction was an element of the felony theft which must be alleged and proved during the evidentiary phase of the trial. In so holding, the court noted that subsequent to the conviction, &sect; 16-1(e)(1) was amended to prohibit the introduction of prior theft convictions at trial.

The court found it was not error to deny defendant's motion for automatic substitution of the judge or to not question the venire more thoroughly with respect to their attitudes concerning the presumption of innocence. The court also found that defendant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel because he was not prejudiced by the errors complained of, taken individually or cumulatively. The court had also previously rejected defendant's constitutional challenges to the Illinois death penalty statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 9-1 (1979), under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Although the court agreed with defendant that his conviction for aggravated arson had to be reversed because the statute defining the offense had been invalidated, a new capital sentencing hearing was not required because the invalid conviction played no role in the jury's determination that the defendant was eligible for the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Appellate Court for the Second District (Illinois), which reversed the trial court's judgment dismissing child abduction charges against defendant after finding them to be an unconstitutional ex post facto application of the law. Instead, the court of appeals court found that the law was not applied ex post facto and that Illinois had criminal jurisdiction over the child abduction counts against defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with child abduction, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 10-5(b)(1) (Supp. 1984), and unlawful restraint, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 10-3 (1977) involving his daughters. On appeal, defendant only questioned whether Illinois could assert criminal jurisdiction over him after he harbored his children outside Illinois and failed to return them to their mother in alleged violation of an Illinois court order. The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals, and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. After considering several factors, the court held that Illinois had criminal jurisdiction over defendant, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1-5(c) (1985) because the offense as charged was based on an omission to perform a duty imposed by the law of Illinois. In addition, the court held that given the substantial interests involved in the prohibition of child abduction, and given the fault or wrongdoing inherent in defendant's conduct, it would not be fundamentally unfair to hold defendant criminally liable for that conduct. Therefore, the court concluded that the child abduction counts were improperly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's conviction was affirmed on appeal, and the United States Supreme Court denied his petition for certiorari. Defendant then filed a petition under the Act, which the trial court dismissed. The court affirmed. Defendant could not make a substantial showing of a violation of his federal constitutional rights. Defendant claimed that the prosecution's use of peremptory challenges to exclude black men from the jury violated his right to a fair trial. The Batson rule, however, was inapplicable, since defendant's case was not pending on direct appeal at the time Batson was decided. Defendant also claimed that the victim's race made it more likely that he would receive a death sentence. Defendant relied on a study concluding that a suspect accused of killing a white victim in Illinois is four times more likely to receive the death penalty than is a suspect accused of killing a black victim. The court found the United States Supreme Court concluded that a similar study in Georgia did not demonstrate a constitutionally significant risk of racial bias affecting the capital-sentencing process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he was arrested without probable cause, that his inculpatory statements were inadmissible, and that the death penalty was excessive punishment. The court affirmed. The circumstances known to the officers when they arrested defendant were sufficient to give rise to probable cause to believe that he had obstructed justice. Defendant's right to remain silent was &quot;scrupulously honored.&quot; Defendant stated that he understood his Miranda rights and confessed that he had beaten the victim to death. After giving the statement, defendant signed a statement in which he waived his right to remain silent, and signed a typed confession. Given the extreme heinousness of the beating and the sexual assault, the prosecutor did not abuse his discretion in asking for the death penalty. The record clearly established that the defendant killed the victim &quot;in the course&quot; of committing an aggravated criminal sexual assault. The aggravating felony was not an isolated or incidental part of the beating which caused the victim's death. Given the record of extreme aggravation and the scant evidence in mitigation, the trial court did not abuse discretion in imposing a sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four women were murdered in a shop. Subsequently, defendant was indicted of four counts of murder and four counts of felony murder. The jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts. At a separate bifurcated hearing, as to which defendant waived his right to a jury, the trial court found that the necessary aggravating factors existed, and that there were no mitigating circumstances sufficient to preclude imposition of the death penalty. The trial court thereupon sentenced defendant to death on each of the felony-murder convictions. In affirming the judgments of conviction and sentence, the court held that a review of the record indicated that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel. Additionally, the court held that while the prosecutor's characterization of defendant as an &quot;animal&quot; during argument to the jury was improper, the comment did not constitute reversible error. Similarly, the court held that the prosecutor's opinion that it would have been impossible for a witness to read a license plate from the distance described in the witness' testimony was not improper.

While the matter was pending before the county board's determination, the incorporators withdrew their request and sought a ruling in the circuit court that para. 2-3-18 was unconstitutional.

On appeal, the incorporators claimed that the power to make the statutory determinations that the proposed incorporation was compatible with the county's official development plan and that the proposed village would have a sufficient tax base to provide all necessary services was quasi-judicial in nature. The court affirmed, finding that para. 2-3-18 requiring two defined determinations by the county board of certain counties, as a precondition to the incorporation of villages did not represent an unlawful delegation of judicial power.

The court first determined that the court of claims did not have exclusive jurisdiction over this action because it was not an action against the state.

While his motion for summary judgment was pending, the appellate court in plaintiff employee's action declared the statute at issue in both cases, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 2001-2012, to be unconstitutional, and his summary judgment was granted. Defendant board and intervenor state appealed, and the court consolidated all appeals. The court affirmed the reversal of the grant of plaintiff employee's summary judgment and reversed the grant of plaintiff teacher's summary judgment as to the count that alleged the suspension procedures violated the Illinois School Code. The court held that the statute regulating what documents were discoverable was vague and uncertain and was therefore unconstitutional by violating the due process rights of employers of ordinary intelligence who could not determine which personnel documents were subject to disclosure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court found the driving privilege statute improperly assigned to the judicial branch the responsibility for the issuance of hardship driver's licenses on the ground that that was a function normally performed by the Secretary of State as a member of the executive branch of government. On appeal, the court reversed and found no violation of the Separation of Powers doctrine. The court held that a circuit court could perform certain nonjudicial functions, as provided by a statute, without violating the Separation of Powers doctrine and the issuance of a Judicial Driving Permit a circuit court neither conferred undue power to one branch of government, usurped the executive branch's powers, nor unduly burdened the judicial branch with a nonjudicial function.

Defendant had been charged with practicing medicine without a license. The circuit court agreed with defendant that the Illinois Medical Practice Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 4401 et seq. (1985), was unconstitutional as applied to the practice of acupuncture.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

The circuit court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charge. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case to the circuit court. The court found that the Act did not require acupuncturists to have a medical degree under &sect; 5(1)(b) of the Act, and that those who wished to practice acupuncture could obtain a limited license under &sect; 5(2). The court reasoned that acupuncture does not constitute &quot;operative surgery&quot; within the meaning of the Act, and, therefore, acupuncture was covered by &sect; 5(2). The court rejected the circuit court's finding that acupuncture was not Western medicine and therefore was not covered by the Act. The court found instead that the Act did not in any way indicate that it was limited to Western medicine, and, therefore, the court would not conclude that it was.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the state argued that the lower court found that the act was unconstitutionally vague because of a variance between the mental state requirements in the definition of drug paraphernalia in &sect; 2(d) of the act and the statement of legislative intent in &sect; 6 of the act. Defendants argued that the act was unconstitutionally vague because the definition of drug paraphernalia in &sect; 2(d) of the act and the penalty provision in &sect; 3(a) of the act contained contradictory mental state requirements. The court agreed because while the legislature apparently intended that scienter be included in the definition of drug paraphernalia, the penalty section allowed for convictions based upon the constructive knowledge of the seller. As a result of the conflict, citizens were not afforded fair notice of what conduct was prohibited and law-enforcement personnel were not provided clear standards in applying the law.

The trial court awarded damages in a malpractice action, but reduced the award for comparative negligence. The court of appeals ordered a new trial.

The physician argued that the trial judge erred in failing to order separate trials as to the statute of limitations and liability issues and that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. The court reversed the decision because (1) the physician made representations to the patient that alleviated her concerns about the birth control pill and blood clots, (2) the patient was entitled to rely on her physician's opinion, and the physician could not avoid estoppel by pointing to other sources that the patient could have consulted, and (3) the patient's experts produced substantial testimony that the physician departed from the standard of care.

Because of the increased risk they undertake in dealing with, state and county public aid workers are deserving of heightened protection.

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-13, 12-14 (1985). The Circuit Court of Marion County (Illinois) and the Circuit Court of Fayette County (Illinois), respectively, dismissed the charges, holding that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants claimed that there was no standard to determine the nature or quality of force constituting an offense under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-13 (1985). The court held that due process required clear definitions in a penal statute and that, in construing a statute, the court was required to consider the language and the legislative intent. The court found that the statute recodified prior law and that the legislature intended to retain the prior definition of force. Thus, the court rejected the defendants' claim of vagueness and found that the statute proscribed only those acts of sexual penetration accomplished by the use of force. Although the statute did not specifically refer to compulsion or consent, the court held that these terms were relevant because proof of force implicitly showed non-consent. The court also rejected the lower courts' holding that the definition of bodily harm for the offense of aggravated criminal sexual under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-14 (1985) lacked a sufficiently objective standard. The court held that this term had a well-known legal meaning and that the court could assume that this meaning was intended by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

He had not had a conviction in 11 years, and alleged that he had been rehabilitated and was not dependent upon illegal drugs. The court denied his admission but, because a future showing of rehabilitation was possible, the court held the matter open for re-application. The court held that the determination of the committee did not bind the court. It had the inherent power to regulate the admission to the bar and a duty to protect the public from dishonesty and incompetency. The applicant had failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that he was now fit to practice law. The court pointed out that there were inconsistencies in his application.

The appellate court reversed the dismissal of the homeowners' action and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the action was filed within the term of the roofer's guarantee and, as such, was timely for purposes of the Construction Limitations Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. 110/13--214 (1983). The court held that it was unable to discern the important governmental interest served by impairing a preexisting express guarantee of less than 12 years while, at the same time, preserving the effect of a preexisting express guarantee of longer than 12 years.</SPAN></P>

The patient's claim for negligent failure to exercise due care in performing the surgery was brought eight years after the surgery. The appellate court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the complaint only as to the nurse because it held the nurse was not within the benefit of the statute of limitations for medical malpractice. The nurse argued the appellate court erred in interpreting an amendment to the statute of limitations. Prior to the amendment, the statute enumerated physicians, dentists, and hospitals. The amendment added registered nurses as protected by the statute. The court found the legislative intent of the first statute was to extend the reach of the protection of the statute of limitations to registered nurses employed by hospitals. The court found it was inconceivable that the legislature intended to protect only physicians, dentists and &quot;hospitals&quot; in a narrow, unreal sense, leaving nurses exposed to liability for later discovered malpractice. The complaint against the nurse was barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

Appellee contended that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction because appellant county collector did not mail notice of the proceedings. On appeal, the appellate court held that notice by mail was required and reversed the circuit court judgment. On further appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the appellate court. Although the court found that the case was moot because appellee had paid the taxes, the court decided the appeal because of the public importance of the issues involved. The court held that neither the Scavenger Act, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, nor 1970 Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 8(a) required notice by mail of scavenger proceedings. The court found that the proceedings utilized guaranteed personal and mailed notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the loss of property interests, and the fact that one hearing in the process might occur without notice by mail was not constitutionally significant.</SPAN></P>

The organization challenged those decisions under &sect; 68 of the Public Utilities Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 2/3, para. 72 (1971). The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. It found that the telephone company was required by statute to collect the new rates, which were found just and reasonable by the commission, and the company had received no unlawful charges of which it should be &quot;disgorged&quot; under restitution principles. As such, the court's prior decision holding that certain expenses and deductions allowed in the rate order were improper was final. Therefore, the portion of the rates that was held to be erroneously set by the commission was to be refunded to the customers who paid them from the time of the prior decision until the new rates took effect.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Randolph County (Illinois) that dismissed charges against each of the four inmates of unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon, a violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 24-1.1. The trial judge ruled that the statute was unconstitutional and that the charging instruments failed to allege an offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were inmates of a correctional facility when they allegedly committed their offenses. Each was charged with possession of homemade weapons that were found in cells in the course of searches conducted by prison authorities. The inmates argued that the statute violated due process because it was vague. But in each case, the dangerous weapon was found in the inmate's cell, a place clearly within the intended reach of the statute. The defendants failed to show that the statute was vague as applied to them, and accordingly their argument that the statute was facially vague failed. If their contention was that the statute was unconstitutional simply because it prohibited innocent conduct, then their complaint was not one of vagueness, but rather one of substantive due process. The court believed that the statute provided a single offense, which could be committed in a variety of ways. Contrary to the inmate's argument, no unlawful intent was required with respect to an imprisoned felon's possession of a dangerous weapon.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, par. 2, &sect; 203(e)(2)(E) of the Illinois Income Tax Act, which prevented the carryback of net operating losses by parent-subsidiary affiliated groups electing to file a consolidated federal corporate income tax return.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parent-subsidiary taxpayers both elected to file consolidated federal corporate income tax returns and then attempted to carry back their losses to reduce their state income taxes.

On appeal of the lower courts' denial of their separate claims that such a law was in violation of Equal Protection and of uniformity of taxation, Ill. Const. art IX, &sect; 2, the court ruled that the Act violated Ill. Const. art IX, &sect; 2. The court found that there was no real and substantial difference between a corporation which was a member of an affiliated corporate group that elected to file a federal consolidated return and a corporation which was a member of an affiliated corporate group that did not elect to file a consolidated federal return and that the classification bore no reasonable relationship to the object of the legislation or to public policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a defendant driver's license was summarily suspended for having a blood alcohol level exceeding .10, she filed a petition for restoration of her driving privileges, and the trial court declared the statutory provisions regarding reinstatement and the collection of fees unconstitutional. The Secretary of State intervened and appealed the finding. In reversing, the court held that a review of &sect; 6-208.1(b) in the context of the entire drivers' licensing law (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 6-101 et seq. (1985)) led to the conclusion that the challenged provision was clear enough to permit uniform enforcement, and it was therefore constitutional. The court further found that the collection and forwarding of fees by the judiciary essentially involved little more than inter-branch communication and administrative cooperation. The court did not consider the collection of reinstatement fees to be an essential power belonging exclusively to one branch, nor was it persuaded that the procedure would detract from the exercise of judicial functions in any significant sense.</SPAN></P>

The State indicated that it would seek the death penalty in the event defendant was convicted of murder.

After he was convicted, defendant again tendered a waiver of the sentencing jury, and the trial court accepted the waiver. On appeal of his convictions and sentences, defendant raised 16 issues: three concerned the conduct of the trial, nine concerned the conduct of the death penalty hearing, and four raised issues challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty statute. The appellate court rejected defendant's contentions and affirmed, finding no error in the conduct of defendant's trial or sentencing hearing and finding defendant's arguments concerning the constitutionality of the death penalty statute to be without merit. The appellate court specifically held, inter alia, that although defendant attempted to waive a sentencing jury, the state was nevertheless allowed to query prospective jurors concerning the imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

One of the women was pregnant, and both she and her baby died as a result of the gunshot wounds. The other lived, which led to the apprehension of the defendant.

He then waived his right to sentencing by the jury and opted for the sentencing by the court. The court sentenced him to death for the aggravating factor of the murder which occurred in the course of the rape, another felony. He appealed based upon a multitude of errors. The court affirmed the conviction after finding the feticide statute to be constitutional and not arbitrary and capricious. The court also found no error in the remarks of the prosecutor because the remarks were not of the severity to taint the jury. Further, the court ruled that the admission of the testimony evidence was properly handled and the photographs, though gruesome, were helpful for clarification to the jury. The sentence of death was also affirmed due to the aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 46, para. 20--14 (1983) after she distributed anonymous leaflets urging voters to support a political candidate. The trial court dismissed the charge on the ground that the statute violated the First Amendment and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 4 (1970). On appeal, the court affirmed and explained that the statute did not prohibit the anonymous distribution of all leaflets, but only political literature soliciting votes for or against any candidate or regarding any public question to be submitted for ballot. The court held that the statute was not well-tailored to serve the goal of an informed electorate. By banning anonymity, the law deterred many from expressing their opinions, decreasing the flow of information to the public. Further, the law was too broad in that it criminalized not only false and malicious statements concerning candidates, but also true ones, and even anonymous literature which was laudatory of a candidate. Thus, the statute unnecessarily restricted protected expression and could not be considered the least drastic alternative for preventing or remedying character assassination.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff chief judge sought a writ of mandamus or prohibition against the board declaring the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act (act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, pars. 1601 through 1627 (1985), unconstitutional and inapplicable to judicial employers.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court found that the deputy circuit clerks were not within the scope of the act, and the board had no jurisdiction over a representation petition. The appellate court reversed. In the other action, the chief judge sought to bar the board from proceeding on unfair labor practice charges filed against him, asserting that the complaining probation officers were judicial, not state, employees, and the act was being unconstitutionally applied to judicial employers. On review, the court held that the deputy clerks were within the act and were employees of the circuit clerk, rather than the chief judge, and that the probation officers were considered state employees. The court further held that judicial employees were within the scope of the act, and that their inclusion did not by itself violate the separation-of-powers principle or trench on the administrative and supervisory authority granted by the constitution to the judicial branch.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in entering judgment on each of the four murder counts because there was only one homicide.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While in police custody, defendant made eight statements to investigating officers, admitting kidnaping, sexually assaulting, and killing a five-year-old girl. Defendant was subsequently convicted of murder and aggravated kidnaping, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 9 -- 1, 10 -- 2 (1981), after a jury trial. The trial judge found defendant eligible for the death penalty because he killed the victim in the course of committing another felony, she was under 16 years of age, and she was killed in an exceptionally brutal manner indicative of wanton cruelty, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 9 -- 1(b)(6), (b)(7) (1981). After hearing evidence in aggravation and mitigation, the circuit judge imposed the death penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) for intentional murder, knowing murder, felony murder, attempted murder, aggravated battery, and unlawful use of weapons. Defendant was sentenced to death under the multiple-murder aggravating-factor provision of the death penalty statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(b)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being stopped by a store security guard for concealing merchandise in his pocket, defendant fired at several employees and shot the guard. Defendant then fled and another employee was found with a fatal gunshot wound in a portion of the store in which defendant had been. On appeal, the court held that there was sufficient evidence that defendant had shot the victim to support his murder conviction. Although the incident was not witnessed, it was unreasonable to think that anyone else shot the victim. The court held that the death penalty was justified because defendant previously had been found guilty of murder in California. The requirement that each murder conviction be based upon either intent or knowledge was met. Both the Illinois and California murder statutes required intent or knowledge in order for a killing to constitute murder. The difference between Illinois and California in the manner of imposing the death penalty subsequent to conviction was not relevant. The court held that defendant's convictions for knowing murder and felony murder had to be vacated because only one person was murdered and only the most serious conviction, intentional murder, could stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's convictions for knowing murder and felony murder, and affirmed the remainder of his convictions. The court stayed the order of execution pending notification as to whether other states wished to waive their rights to penal custody of defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that (1) the evidence was sufficient; (2) the denial of the motion did not result in prejudice to defendant; (3) the trial court did not err by denying the motion for change of venue because the level of awareness of the case on the part of the venire was not so great as to deny defendant a fair trial; (3) defendant was not prejudiced by the prosecution's actions; (4) the trial court's refusal to give the instruction did not constitute error because a general mitigating factor instruction was given; (5) the trial court erred by refusing the petition for relief without an evidentiary hearing because it had to make a determination of whether the witness was legitimately invoking the Fifth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which granted plaintiff taxpayer's motion for summary judgment in an action for injunctive and declaratory relief as to the use and the occupation tax's allegedly unconstitutional exclusion of South African currency from an exemption for domestic and foreign currency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the taxpayer's summary judgment motion in its injunctive and declaratory relief action that asserted that the state unconstitutionally excluded South Africa from a tax exemptions in the Use Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, paras. 439.8. 439.9 (1985), and the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 440 et seq. (1985), for foreign and domestic currency. The court affirmed that grant on appeal. The court reasoned that the legislative history showed both that avoiding the appearance of encouraging South African investment was the exclusion's plain purpose and that that exclusion was severable. The court also held that an executive order that banned the importation of Krugerrands did not make the taxpayer's claim moot because it did not effect the trading of Krugerrands that were already in the country. The court further determined that the exclusion impermissibly encroached on the federal government's exclusive authority to conduct foreign affairs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was arrested after police officers observed her standing in the roadway, stopping vehicles containing men, and engaging them in conversation.

The trial court dismissed the charge on the grounds that the statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's ruling. The court held that the statute was a reasonable restriction of the time, manner, and place of speech and therefore permissible under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. I, and that the distinction it made between solicitation by charities and other types of solicitation did not violate the defendant's right to equal protection under the United States or Illinois constitutions because it was reasonably related to the legitimate governmental objective of balancing safety considerations against the relative social value of the activities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers and taxpayers' association attacked the assessment of property taxes, and the complaint was dismissed as to the individual taxpayers. They appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that a private citizen has no authority to bring a suit for the collection of taxes. The court noted that the complaint was in many respects unintelligible, but that because the government officials had never argued the legal insufficiency of the complaint, the court would not decide that issue. The court determined that the complaint alleged that property belonging to persons other than the taxpayers had either been underassessed or improperly exempted from taxation. The court noted that the taxpayers' only stake in the underassessment of other types of property was its effect on their taxes and that the taxpayers' inability to force the government officials to increase other assessments did not render the tax-objection proceeding an inadequate remedy. The court also determined that the taxpayers' specific allegations regarding tax-exempt property in one county were deficient due to inadequate description of the exempt properties and a vague request for relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended his confession following his arrest was improperly admitted into evidence and that the conviction under the former version of the aggravated arson statute was invalid. A doctor testified that defendant had a crushed trachea that resulted from a blunt trauma to defendant's neck and upper chest area. The court held that the evidence did not clearly establish that defendant was injured while in police custody. Although symptoms of defendant's injuries were noticed while he was in custody, defense did not demonstrate when the injury occurred. Defendant's cough was the single external indication of his injury. Because defendant failed to establish that he was injured while in police custody, and because this point was not conceded by the state, the court declined to require the prosecution to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that defendant's injury was wholly unrelated to his confession. However, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 20-1.1(a)(1) (1981) had been declared unconstitutional. Because the aggravated-arson conviction had to be reversed, the court remanded the cause for sentencing on the arson conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that certain subsections of the statute had previously been found to be unconstitutional by the Illinois Supreme Court. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 20-1.1(a)(3) (1983) was held to be unconstitutional on the ground that the statute, which defined aggravated arson, did not require an unlawful purpose in setting a fire, and therefore swept too broadly. The court found that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 20-1.1(a)(1) (1983) was similarly unconstitutional. The court noted that while the legislature intended subsections (1), (2), and (3) of the statute to constitute enhancements of the arson offense, the underlying charge had not been properly defined.</SPAN></P>

The defendant failed to carry his burden of establishing that he held a reasonable expectation of privacy in a pickup truck at the time it was searched and seized.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State, in four consolidated cases, challenged judgments of the Circuit Courts of Marion County, Effingham County, Champaign County, and Fayette County (Illinois), which concluded that &sect; 12--603.1 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 12--603.1 (1985), was unconstitutional and dismissed defendant drivers' traffic citations for failure to wear seat safety belts while operating their motor vehicles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from trial courts' findings that &sect; 12--603.1, which required the use of seat belts, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The court noted that regulations that limited a person's constitutional right to privacy could be justified only by a &quot;compelling state interest,&quot; and the legislation was required to be narrowly drawn to express only the legitimate state interests at stake. It could not have been said that a driver's claimed right to decide whether or not to wear a safety belt on a public highway resembled those liberties identified by the United States Supreme Court as being included in the right of privacy protected by the fourteenth amendment. The court held that the statute did not infringe upon a driver's right of privacy protected by the fourteenth amendment or by the state constitution. The court also held that the statute did not violate the due process clauses of the state or federal constitutions. The legislature could have rationally determined that the seat-belt use law served the public safety and welfare by reducing the likelihood that a driver would lose control of his vehicle and jeopardize other motorists or pedestrians.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments below holding unconstitutional the state statute requiring the use of seat belts were reversed, and the causes were remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged a decision by an Illinois appellate court, which held that respondent, committed individual, was entitled to a formal fitness hearing concerning his competency to stand trial for murder. The appellate court also decided to defer consideration of the challenged hearings on involuntary admission in light of its resolution of the fitness issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue on appeal by the state, was whether the trial court erred in refusing to grant the committed individual a new fitness hearing in regard to his fitness to stand trial for murder. The committed individual was subjected to involuntary admission after an initial fitness hearing and further involuntary admission hearings were held as the committed individual continued to be confined. The committed individual asserted that he was entitled to a new fitness hearing and an appellate court also agreed. The court affirmed that decision, but held that the involuntary admission hearings were proper based upon their evidence. The court held that the issue of whether the committed individual was fit to stand trial was totally unrelated to the issue of whether he was subject to involuntary admission. The court found that Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 38, para. 104-23(b)(3), was not dispositive of the issue. The court then concluded that the guarantee of fundamental fairness inherent in the due process clause required periodic review of the committed individual's fitness status, so as to determine if he was fit to stand trial, thereby ensuring that his speedy trial rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision in part and reversed and remanded it in part. The court held that the committed individual was indeed entitled to periodic review of his fitness status so as to determine if he was fit to stand trial to ensure that his due process rights were not violated. The court also found that the involuntary admission hearings were proper because sufficient evidence had been presented to justify the decisions.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court had reversed the conviction based on a finding that Ill. Rev.

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the appellate court's decision to vacate defendant's conviction and fine. The court held that the legislature, in the preamble, had explicitly asserted an intention to penalize the sale look-alike substances more harshly then the sale of some controlled substances and therefore the statute was valid.</SPAN></P>

The presiding judge reassigned the petition, and the State filed a motion to have para. 122-8 declared violative of the separation of powers clause of the state constitution. The motion was granted, para. 122-8 was declared unconstitutional, and the petition was sent back to the trial judge. The defendant sought review.

The appellate court reversed upon the grounds that the complaint generally sounded in fraud, and, as such, the claim was excepted from the operation of the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies. The court reversed the appellate court, holding that the director and the agency were protected by sovereign immunity. There were two exceptions to sovereign immunity, it did not apply when the complaint alleged that a statute was unconstitutional, or when it alleged that an official was acting beyond his authority. The lottery winners' complaint primarily alleged that the director breached his contract with them, and that claim had to be brought before the Court of Claims. Secondly, the court held that the complaint did not state an action in fraud because it did not plead the elements of fraud, thus it did not avoid the operation of the rule that the lottery winners had to exhaust their administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

The court allowed plaintiff's petition for leave to appeal and affirmed, holding that the county's retention of the interest penalty on delinquent taxes collected by the county for other governmental units was not a fee within the meaning of Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 9(a) (1970). The court found that, absent the statute in question, the village was not entitled to interest on delinquent taxes. The penalty funds existed only because the statute created a penalty for the delinquent payment of taxes. The statute did not deprive the village of the interest it would have received had the taxes been promptly paid over to the units by the county, and the proceeds placed at interest. With respect to the equal protection challenge, the court held that a rational basis existed upon which to distinguish counties from other taxing units for purposes of receiving fiscal benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court affirming the trial court's dismissal of the village's challenge to a statute authorizing the county to retain interest charged on delinquent property taxes collected on behalf of the village.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court ruled, among other things, that &sect; 19.10 of the Revenue Act of 1939, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 500.10 (1983), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court ruled: (1) &sect; 500.10 was unconstitutional because it purported to provide an exemption not specifically provided for in Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 6, which limited exemptions to property used exclusively for school, religious, cemetery, and charitable purposes; (2) the corporation did not qualify for the Ill. Rev.

He argued that his fee claim had priority over the &quot;street value&quot; fine imposed on his client, and that the street value fine provision, Ill. Rev.

The bond stated that if a fine or court costs were adjudged, the remainder of the deposit was to go to the fine or costs. Before trial, defendant assigned his right to the bail deposit to the defense attorney. Defendant was convicted of a drug offense. The trial court increased his bail bond. Defendant deposited more money to meet the new 10 percent. As a sentence, defendant was assessed a fine under &sect; 5-9-1.1 of the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev.

The court held that &sect; 444.1(4) did not require the release into the general revenue fund of alternative retaliatory taxes that the insurance companies indicated were being protested.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by indictment with two murders and the rape and kidnapping of a woman.

The defendant appealed, challenging the composition of the jury, prosecutorial conduct, the sufficiency of the evidence, and his sentences. On appeal, the court held that the defendant received a fair trial, that the evidence was sufficient to convict, that the defendant had ample opportunity to consult with counsel regarding his decision to waive the jury for purposes of sentencing, that the death sentence was properly imposed, and that there was no evidence of any brutal or heinous behavior which accompanied the kidnapping and rape.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the chemical company's motion for dismissal based on forum non conveniens and issued a gag order prohibiting the chemical company from contact with the media. The appellate court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the chemical company's third appeal for reconsideration of forum non conveniens because the motion was time barred and upheld the gag order. The chemical company appealed. The court reversed and remanded. The court remanded the forum non conveniens issue to the appellate court because the last motion on forum non conveniens raised new matters and was therefore timely. The victims' arguments were unpersuasive. The gag order was unconstitutional under the First Amendment because the mere possibility of juror influence made the order an impermissible prior restraint on speech. The order was also unconstitutionally overly broad because it restrained all media contact, vague because it was unclear what conduct and utterances were proscribed, and unnecessary because counsel had assured the court no further contact would occur, and less restrictive alternative measures like contempt of court were available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence of death, holding in part that where the State introduced a part of defendant's statement, he was entitled to have additional portions admitted if needed to prevent the jury from being misled. However, he had no right to introduce unrelated exculpatory statements in an attempt to avoid taking the stand. Defendant failed in his responsibility to specify what portion of his statements had to be admitted to avoid the jury from being misled. Defendant waived any potential claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, based on a potential conflict of his lawyer allegedly tampering with a witness, when he was apprised of the potential conflict when it arose and he allowed the representation to continue. The court held that denying defendant's motion to sever on the basis of antagonistic defenses was addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and any antagonism was not so severe as to deprive defendant of a fair trial. The use of a death-qualified jury was permissible, and the Illinois death penalty statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's original death sentence for his murder conviction was reversed and remanded because of errors, which occurred during the sentencing hearing. At the sentencing hearing on remand, defendant argued that the state was precluded from attempting to obtain a death sentence a second time for the same conviction, on the grounds of double jeopardy. The trial court denied defendant's motion. On direct appeal, the court affirmed. The court agreed with defendant that double jeopardy principles can apply to capital sentencing hearings, even though they do not generally apply to sentencing determinations. The court found, however, that because the reversal of the sentencing was for trial error, rather than evidentiary insufficiency, it did not bar a second capital sentencing hearing. The court refused to apply the rule suggesting that the prosecution's deliberate provocation of a motion for mistrial would bar retrial because there was no evidence that the state had attempted to provoke a mistrial and defendant had failed to file a motion for mistrial.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that there was probable cause to support the first arrest because shortly after the murders, defendant appeared before the police in physical appearance that was both highly unusual and consistent with his having committed the crimes. The court held that defendant's fingerprints were lawfully obtained because defendant's person was subject to a full search incident to his first arrest. The court also held that the fingerprints provided the probable cause for the second arrest.

The court found that the treble damages embraced the &quot;private attorney general&quot; concept and gave patients power to police abuses. The court found that if the jury found for the patient and returned a verdict that awarded the patient both recoveries, the trial court was to enter judgment on the two verdicts in the alternative so that the patient recovered only one satisfaction.

This provision allowed for the adjustment of district lines when two or more districts lay within municipal boundaries, but applied only to one county in the state due to a population classification.

The court agreed with the fire districts that there was no reasonable basis for the population classification, for there was no basis, in reason and principle, for regarding Du Page County as a distinct and separate class. If a real need existed to eliminate the alleged disadvantages and dangers of multiple fire protection districts serving one municipality, then the same need to remedy the evil also existed in other counties as well, regardless of the level of the population of the county.</SPAN></P>

The imposition of a tax on the issuance of a marriage license did not bear a reasonable relation to the public interest sought to be protected and the means adopted was not a reasonable means of accomplishing the desired objective. The imposition of the special tax upon the issuance of a marriage license imposed a direct impediment to the exercise of the fundamental right to marry and had to be subjected to the heightened test of strict scrutiny. The court held that the state had not demonstrated a compelling state interest that would satisfy the strict-scrutiny test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital, in this consolidated appeal, challenged the rulings of the Appellate Court of the First District (Illinois) that reversed the trial court's findings that appellee patients' causes of action arising from medical treatment were barred by the four-year statute of repose set forth in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 13-212 (1983).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although patients' actions were based upon acts that occurred before the four-year repose provision took effect, they were untimely because they were commenced more than four years after that date. The new four-year repose provision shortened the limitations period, leaving patients no time in which to file their actions; thus, they were allowed a reasonable time to bring their actions. However, such a reasonable time did not extend beyond that provided by the new repose period. The repose period was intended to terminate the possibility of liability after a defined period of time regardless of a potential plaintiff's lack of knowledge of his cause of action. The court also rejected the constitutional challenges to the repose provision. It restricted the time within which an action could be brought, it did not eliminate an entire category or type of action. Further, it was extended for fraudulently concealed causes and causes in which equitable estoppel applied. In addition, the constitutionally established policy of providing a remedy for every wrong inflicted was tempered by the policy of barring actions brought after the period of time in the interests of justice.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied appellant's motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining collection of the tax and the appellate court affirmed. The court affirmed the affirmance of the denial of a preliminary injunction because the simple existence of statutes that demonstrated a legislative intent to exclude harbors from the &quot;government and affairs&quot; of appellee did not show that appellee was deprived of the authority to enact the ordinance under Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(g). The court held that the presence of the statutes did not show that the legislature intended to establish and maintain an &quot;exclusive statewide dominion&quot; over harbors. Furthermore, Ill.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty as to two counts of murder and one count of armed robbery. The sentencing jury found the existence of statutory aggravating factors (Ill. Rev.

Accordingly, the court sentenced defendant to death on the murder counts and imposed a 30-year term of imprisonment on the armed robbery count. In affirming the sentence, the court held that, even if the trial court erred in explaining the possible sentence for each charge, defendant's purported belief that he would be sentenced to a term of years was untenable based on the record. Moreover, the court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in denying his post-judgment motion to withdraw his guilty plea and substitute it for a plea of guilty but mentally ill. The court found no error in the prosecutor's introduction, during sentencing, of evidence as to the personal traits of the victims.

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 9 -- 1(a)(1) through (a)(3) (1981), and armed robbery in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 18 -- 2(a) (1981). The trial court imposed the death sentence on the murder counts and an extended-term sentence of 60 years on the armed robbery count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to the murder and robbery of a woman. On appeal, the court found that defendant's statement gave the police probable cause to arrest him because the officers did not need evidence sufficient to convict, but only knowledge of facts that would have led a reasonable man to believe that a crime had been committed and that it had been committed by defendant. The court agreed that the confession must be corroborated by some evidence, exclusive of the confession, tending to show that a crime did occur and that the defendant committed it; however, the court found that the physical evidence corroborated his statements. A prosecutor's comment on defendant's lack of remorse, even if taken as a comment on his failure to testify, was cured by a sustained objection and a general instruction to the jury. The court rejected constitutional challenges to the death penalty, particularly to &quot;death-qualification&quot; of the jury as being violative of his right to a jury that was fair cross-section of the community and as yielding a jury that was pre-disposed to convict. The court also held that an extended-term sentence could be imposed on the robbery despite a death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for murder and armed robbery and the imposition of the death sentence and an extended-term sentence.</SPAN></P>

The buyer claimed that &sect; 2600 violated its equal protection rights because of an unreasonable burden to discover the seller's debts owed to the department that was not required with other taxes. The buyer lost at the administrative, trial, and appellate court levels. The court affirmed the decision for the department because &sect; 2600 merely required the seller to produce documentation from the department that there was no money owing. Thus, the buyer was not obligated to discover the department's debts. Also, &sect; 2600 was constitutional because the difference between the taxes was reasonably related to the legitimate purpose of the Act to pay unemployment benefits. The buyer had an opportunity and did contest the claim. The department timely asserted the charges and did not take any actions upon which the buyer could have relied to excuse payment of the charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a violation of &sect; 11-1003.1 of the Illinois Vehicle Code. Defendant allegedly drove into the path of a bicyclist who struck the rear of defendant's automobile. The circuit court dismissed the charge, holding that &sect; 11-1003.1 was unconstitutional. Specifically, the circuit court found that &sect; 11-1003.1 was vague and ambiguous because it did not apprise a driver of any way to avoid being cited. The circuit court also held that the statute was invalid in part because the statute required a driver to exercise &quot;due care&quot; but did not define the term. The state appealed and the court reversed and remanded for further proceedings, holding that &sect; 11-1003.1 was not unconstitutionally. The court noted that a statute was not vague merely because it required the trier of fact to determine whether a driver employed that degree of care which a reasonable person would have employed in a similar situation. The court concluded that, when the statute was considered with reference to the judicial definition of &quot;due care,&quot; it was not impermissibly vague. The statute was not ambiguous as to what type of vehicle owed a duty of &quot;due care&quot; and to whom the duty was owed.</SPAN></P>

The hospital and third parties argued that the requested documents were privileged under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 8-2101.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought an action against the hospital and also against a doctor and hospital administrators for medical malpractice. On plaintiffs' application, the trial court issued a subpoena to the hospital accrediting organization, seeking discovery of reports and surveys in the hands of the organization relating to accreditation of the hospital. The trial court denied the motions of the hospital and the organization to quash the subpoena and held the president in contempt when he refused to comply with the subpoena. The court granted direct appeal. The version of &sect; 8-2101 in effect when the action was brought provided only that the kind of information sought by plaintiffs was confidential and non-admissible. The statute was amended while the action was pending to provide that such information was privileged and non-discoverable. The court held the amendment applied to the pending litigation because the statute was a matter of procedure. The court held that although the organization was not specifically mentioned in the statute, it fell within the statute's general category of &quot;allied medical societies,&quot; and thus the documents were privileged in its hands.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that &sect; 3 --4(b)(1) of the Criminal Code of 1961, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 3 -- 4(b)(1) (1981), and principles of double jeopardy barred his prosecution for homicidal concealment in one county after he was acquitted of the charge of murder in another county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed two people in one county and disposed of their bodies in another. He was acquitted of the murder by reason of self-defense. On appeal, his conviction was affirmed. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 3 -- 4(b)(1) (1981) did not bar the second prosecution because that statute only barred a subsequent prosecution for a different offense for which he could actually have been convicted in the first trial. He could not have been convicted of homicidal concealment in the murder trial because it was not a lesser included offense of murder nor was he charged with that offense. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 3 --3, the state's joinder statute, did not require that the offenses be prosecuted together. The conviction did not violate his constitutional protection against double jeopardy because he was not twice put in jeopardy for the offense of homicidal concealment. The elements of the two crimes were wholly distinct, each with different necessary elements, requiring proof of different facts. Because the prosecutions were for different offenses, he was not deprived of his double jeopardy rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate originally pleaded guilty to a charge of murder, inter alia, and was sentenced by a jury to death. The court affirmed the judgment on direct appeal and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. In the instant appeal, the inmate, who was black, argued that the state's use of its peremptory challenges unconstitutionally excluded blacks from serving on the jury that sentenced him to death, an argument raised in his original appeal, and that he had a constitutional right to have his appeal heard by the appellate court. The court held that the information provided by the inmate failed to meet the threshold suggested in a Supreme Court case for raising the constitutional issue. Moreover, the requirement that the jury contain a fair cross-section of the community apparently was satisfied in the inmate's case. The circuit court correctly ruled that the post-conviction petition did not warrant a hearing. As to the inmate's assertion that he had a constitutional right to have the appeal heard by the appellate court, the validity of the procedures for a direct appeal had been determined already and the court declined to reconsider its decisions on the issue.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the issues raised in defendant's petition could have been addressed in the original appeal because every ground for ineffectiveness that defendant properly raised was apparent from the original appellate record or could have been supplemented to that record.</SPAN></P>

R. 603, 87 Ill. 2d R. 603, of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Rock Island County (Illinois), which dismissed the State's charges against 21 defendants under &sect;&sect; 4 and 5 of the Illinois Public Demonstrations Law, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 85-1 et seq. (1983). The circuit court held &sect; 5 unconstitutional in violation of First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' charges arose out of an anti-nuclear demonstration in which they were accused of blocking a roadway. On appeal, the State argued that the act was a constitutionally permissible time, place and manner restriction, directed at conduct, or the &quot;nonspeech element&quot; of the demonstration, rather than at its content, or the &quot;speech element.&quot; The court noted that &sect; 5 of the statute provided that notice of any march, assembly, meeting or gathering must be given in writing to &quot;the principal law enforcement officer.&quot; However, the term was never defined. Correctly identifying the person requiring notice mandated knowledge of whether the demonstration was to be in a municipal or county roadway. For marches that crossed boundaries of several political subdivisions, demonstrators would have had to guess whether notice needed to be given where the march originated, where it terminated, where it passed through, or all of them. The court held that the law was unconstitutional and that its severability clause could not save any portion of the statute because it had no provision that could be given effect in the absence of a clear definition of the term &quot;principal law enforcement officer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment that the law was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was disbarred after he was convicted in federal court of conspiracy to transport stolen goods in interstate commerce and aiding and abetting the transportation of stolen goods in interstate commerce. The attorney filed his petition for reinstatement in the same month that his probation period ended. In addition to testimony, the hearing board panel also admitted into evidence 30 letters offered by the attorney that were written by a variety of individuals in support of his reinstatement. The attorney argued that the recommendation by the hearing board and review board that his petition for reinstatement be denied was contrary to the weight of the evidence. The court evaluated the factors to be considered in determining the attorney's rehabilitation, good character, and knowledge of the law and found that (1) the attorney was convicted for participation in a scheme to transport stolen jewelry in interstate commerce; (2) the conviction was a further manifestation of a pattern of misconduct that began shortly after the attorney was licensed to practice law; and (3) there was no proof that the attorney made restitution. Finally, it was not error to admit the letters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the attorney's petition for reinstatement.

The baseball club asserted that because the enactments only applied to Wrigley Field, the classifications were a legislative attempt to correct a private nuisance. The court found that it was within the legislative discretion to have enacted the regulations for the proper purpose of protecting the public against a specific public nuisance. Because the statutes at issue only applied to Wrigley Field, the baseball club asserted that they were violative of the principle of separation of powers and denied them due process. The court that the classifications of population, status of the sporting events, hours of usage, and type of facility, were reasonably related to a legitimate purpose.

The trial court overruled defendant's repeated objections to statements made at trial by the codefendant's counsel and denied defendant's motions for a mistrial. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial. Defendant's motion for severance should have been granted because his defense and his codefendant's defense were so antagonistic to each other that defendant could not receive a fair trial. Statements by the codefendant's counsel specifically commenting on defendant's failure to testify violated his rights under the U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV, and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 155-1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged by the state with residential burglary in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 19-3 (1983) in the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois). The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss, holding the statute violated the constitutional guarantees of due process, and that the mandatory minimum sentence violated the limitation-of-penalties provision of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants claimed that the phrase &quot;dwelling place of another&quot; did not afford a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what conduct was prohibited, law-enforcement authorities were given unreasonable and arbitrary discretion over whether to charge a defendant with residential burglary or burglary, and that the mandatory sentencing provision violated the limitation-of-penalties provision. The court held the statute was constitutional and reversed the trial court. The court analyzed the phrase &quot;dwelling place of another&quot; and looked to the legislative intent, and determined the phrase should be given a meaning accorded to that of burglary at common law, which was an offense against habitation not just an offense against property. Given that construction, the phrase was not unconstitutionally vague and did not provide law-enforcement authorities unreasonable and arbitrary discretion. The protection of interests other than property, and the need for a more stringent penalty provision in order to halt an increase in the commission of the crime were proper factors in determining the sentencing scheme, and it did not violate the limitation-of-penalties provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court holding the residential burglary statute unconstitutional was reversed and the causes were remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the judgment of the Appellate Court for the Third District (Illinois), which reversed defendant's conviction for calculated criminal drug conspiracy under &sect; 405(a) of the Controlled Substances Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1405(a) (1981). Defendant argued on appeal that the mandatory fine imposed under &sect; 5-9-1.1 of the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-9-1.1 (1981), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of calculated criminal drug conspiracy and delivery of a controlled substance, in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, paras. 1405(a), 1401(b)(2) (1981). In addition to a sentence of confinement, the trial court imposed a fine based on the street value of the contraband. The appellate court reversed the conviction for conspiracy, affirmed the conviction for delivery, and remanded for resentencing. The court allowed the state's petition for leave to appeal, and affirmed. Under para. 1405(b)(2), the conspiracy required the participation of defendant and two or more other persons. The court found that the evidence was insufficient to show that three individuals participated in a common scheme to deliver cocaine to an undercover agent. Defendant did not get the cocaine directly from the supplier and the supplier did not know about defendant's participation in the sale. The court further held that the mandatory fine imposed under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-9-1.1 did not deprive defendant of due process and equal protection of the law. The legislature had wide discretion to classify offenses and prescribe penalties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of the judgment of the Appellate Court for the Second District (Illinois), which reversed defendants' convictions by one trial court for syndicated gambling under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 28-1.1 (1981), because there was no evidence that the gambling bets were recorded, but affirmed the civil forfeiture order for a car of a defendant by another trial court. The two trial court rulings were consolidated on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were operating an private club where patrons bet on card and dice games. After their arrest for syndicated gambling, one defendant stated to a police officer that the car in the parking lot was his, even though it was titled in a friend's name. The court affirmed the trial court's judgments, but reversed in part, and affirmed in part the appellate court's judgment. The court held that the convictions for syndicated gambling were appropriate because the definition of &quot;bookmaking&quot; found in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 28-1.1(d), was broad enough to include defendants' conduct. The court also ruled that record-keeping of the bet was not a required element of the syndicated gambling offensem nor was proof that defendants were engaged in the &quot;business of bookmaking,&quot; above the minimum statutory requirements that there was evidence of more than five bets or wagers totaling more than $ 2,000. The court also ruled that the trial court's conclusions that the seized car was used in the commission of a gambling offense and that one defendant owned the car, though it was not titled in his name, was not against the manifest weight of evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment that order the civil forfeiture of a defendant's car, but reversed the judgment that reversed defendants' convictions for syndicated gambling. The court affirmed the trial court's judgments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff subcontractor sought to intervene in an action brought by the contractor against the state to recover under a contract. The court of claims denied the petition. The circuit court denied certiorari on the subcontractor's petition against respondent court of claims. The Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois) dismissed the subcontractor's appeal of that judgment and the subcontractor challenged that judgment as well.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor for which the subcontractor did work sought to recover the cost of work performed on contracts with the state. The subcontractor's work was included in the complaint. The state asserted an affirmative defense of fraud on the part of the contractor under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 439.14 (1975) to avoid the claim. The subcontractor, who denied any involvement in the alleged fraud, was denied the right to intervene. The circuit court held that it was without jurisdiction to review the matter. The court allowed the subcontractor's petition to appeal and remanded the cause to the court of claims so that the subcontractor could be afforded the opportunity to be heard. The court held that (1) it had the authority to determine whether the court of claims acted to unconstitutionally deprive the subcontractor if its right to due process; (2) the court of claims, by applying para. 439.14 to the subcontractor without allowing the subcontractor to be heard, deprived it of due process of law; and (3) the Court of Claims Act did give that court exclusive jurisdiction over claims brought against the state, but it did not deny review of those claims by other tribunals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the subcontractor's claim to the court of claims with directions that the subcontractor be afforded the opportunity to be heard in that forum.</SPAN></P>
