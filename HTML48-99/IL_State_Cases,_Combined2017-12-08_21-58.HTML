</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the terms of a plea agreement, defendant pled guilty to one count of burglary, a class two felony. The State dismissed the theft count, a class A misdemeanor. The lower court sentenced defendant to 24 months' intensive probation supervision. After the probation was subsequently revoked, defendant was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The Illinois Supreme Court had already concluded that the burglary statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. cha. 38, para. 19-1 (1987), was not unconstitutionally broad. It allowed prosecutors the discretion to choose whether to charge a defendant with burglary, theft, or retail theft. Defendant had no constitutional right to compel his prosecution for the lesser, rather than the greater, offense. The lower court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to four years' imprisonment. Defendant had been afforded opportunities for rehabilitation in the past, but failed to comply with even the simplest requirements of probation. Also, under Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 38, para. 1005-6-4(h) gave the lower court broad discretion in refusing to refuse credit for time served on probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff litigants sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant court administrators, upon their challenge of the Illinois Not-for-Profit Dispute Resolution Center Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 851 - 856 (1987), where they argued that it violated Ill. Const. art. I &sect; 12, art II &sect; 1, and art. IV &sect; 13 as well as due process and equal protection clauses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that an alternate dispute program was not provided for nor part of the judicial system in the Illinois Constitution and that the cases a neighborhood dispute resolution center (DRC) would hear were typically not justiciable in the law courts; therefore, DRCs were not related to the judicial system. Plaintiffs also challenged the trial court's reliance on the legislature's finding that a filing fee was directly related to the justice system. Defendants argued that DRCs would reduce the number of cases pending in the courts, thus shortening the amount of time it takes to reach a resolution for both those cases going to DRCs and those remaining in the court system. The court held that the trial court properly deferred to the legislature and found that DRCs were related to the operation and maintenance of the courts and that the fee was imposed for a court-related purpose, and that there was a reasonable, nonarbitrary relationship between the purpose of the Act, which is to improve the efficient administration of the court system, and the means adopted, imposing a $ 1 fee on the party &quot;initiating the litigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed his petition to establish paternity and visitation rights pursuant to the Illinois Parentage Act of 1984, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, paras. 2501-2526 (1984), and the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 601 et seq. (1985). The circuit court granted defendant mother's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father alleged he was the father of the mother's child and filed a petition to establish paternity and visitation rights pursuant to the Illinois Parentage Act of 1984 (Act), Ill.

The mother filed a motion to dismiss, claiming the petition was barred by the two-year statute of limitations, and the circuit court granted the motion. The father appealed, challenging the retroactive application and constitutionality of the statute of limitations, and the court affirmed, holding that the action was not filed by or on behalf of the child and as it was filed more than two years after the child's birth, it was barred pursuant to the Act's statute of limitations. The court found that the time period for putative fathers to file an action was rationally related to a government purpose and did not violate equal protection, and that although the statute was applied retroactively to bar the claim, the father did not file his petition within a reasonable amount of time after the Act went into effect, and thus dismissal was proper.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 111 2/3, para. 301 et seq. (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After one driver's vehicle was struck from behind by a CTA bus, she filed a notice of claim with the CTA and a civil action against the bus driver. The second driver filed suit against the bus driver who hit him after his vehicle was also struck from behind by a CTA bus. However, the second driver did not notify the CTA of his claim. The bus drivers filed motions to dismiss pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-619(a)(5) (1985) based on the drivers' failure to comply with the statutory limitations under &sect; 41 of the Metropolitan Transit Authority Act, which required notice to be given to the CTA within six months and suit to be filed within one year from the date of injury. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the Act's limitations provisions extended to employees of the CTA. In response to the bus drivers' motion to dismiss, the drivers did not submit affidavits or any other evidence contradicting the bus drivers' assertion of the respondeat superior doctrine in their motion to dismiss. Due to the CTA's size and the threat of blind claims a rational basis existed for specialized notice and civil action limitations periods.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 4-103(a)(1) (1985), rendered by a jury in the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In view of a recent Illinois Supreme Court ruling, the court rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 4-103(a)(1) of the Illinois Vehicle Code was unconstitutional. The failure to instruct the jury that theft required intent to permanently deprive was not error as defendant was not charged with theft, but with knowing possession of a stolen or converted motor vehicle. Whether defendant intended to permanently deprive the car's owner of its use or benefit had no bearing on the car's character as stolen property as the car was already stolen at the time he obtained possession. The trial judge did not erroneously instruct the jury on the definition of &quot;converted&quot; by using a legal dictionary definition as it was not substantially different from Ill. Pattern Jury Instructions, Crim. No. 23.15A (Supp. 1989). As defendant's allegations were on their face insufficient to show possible neglect of defendant's case but rather showed decisions by counsel well within the bounds of proper trial strategy, remanding for a new post-trial hearing with new counsel to investigate his ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendants alleged that &sect; 5- 8- 4(h) of the Unified Code of Corrections (Ill. Rev.

The court affirmed, holding that there was substantial evidence of defendants' guilt, and that defendants were adequately informed with respect to sentencing. It was stated that &sect; 5-8-4(h) did not violate due process or the doctrine of separation of powers because it applied to defendants only after they committed the burglary, which was after the statute became effective. The court refused to consider the claim that the circuit court failed to determine the voluntariness of defendants' guilty pleas because defendants failed to file a motion to withdraw the pleas as required by Ill.

Defendant was sentenced to natural life imprisonment.

But the court held that the issuance of the warrant was collateral to the issues that were pending in the State's appeal. The court further held that the trial court properly limited defense counsel's cross-examination of a State's witness because the elicited impeachment testimony was likely to confuse the jury. The court also held that the trial court properly sentenced defendant to natural life imprisonment in light of his subsequent criminal charges. Finally, the court held that the mittimus needed to be corrected to reflect that defendant had been convicted of felony murder as opposed to both murder and felony murder.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was granted his motion to dismiss the armed robbery count. The state sought review of the grant of the motion, and defendant sought review of the denial of the motion to dismiss the remaining counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that defendant's motion to dismiss was timely filed. The court held the trial court had the discretion to extend the time for filing in light of the facts that defendant had three different attorneys and was in the process of obtaining transcripts from the federal proceedings. The court next concluded that the trial court's grant of defendant's motion to dismiss the armed robbery count was not erroneous because the prosecution did not commence within the applicable the three-year statute of limitations under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 3--5(b)(1987). The court held that the federal prosecution did not toll the running of the limitations period on the state charges. The court then held that count IV of armed robbery charge was not barred on statutory double jeopardy grounds because defendant was convicted in federal court of a violation of the Hobbs Act, which included robbery. The court held to have a valid double jeopardy claim based on constitutional or statutory grounds defendant had to be charged with the same offense. The court held that the state and federal charges for armed robbery were not the same charges and affirmed the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The sentencing court imposed an extended-term sentence under para. 1005 -- 5 -- 3.2(b)(2) because the crime was accompanied by exceptionally brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty. After exhausting his direct appeals and federal habeas corpus proceedings, defendant filed the instant challenge to the statute, alleging that it was vague and that it violated the Eighth Amendment. The court affirmed the dismissal of his petition, holding that the doctrine of res judicata applied because defendant had unsuccessfully raised the argument in prior proceedings. The court found that the exception to res judicata, the doctrine of fundamental fairness, did not apply in this case. It applied only where the right in question had been recognized for the first time after the direct appeal. The court held that the issue had been raised in other cases, rejecting defendant's claim that the cases only considered vagueness claims under the Fourteenth Amendment and did not address the merit of his Eighth amendment claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner filed an action against defendant city seeking to invalidate a zoning ordinance as unconstitutional and to recover damages for defamation. The trial court dismissed the counts alleging an illegal taking of property and defamation for failure to state a claim.

The court affirmed the summary judgment for plaintiff, but reversed to the extent that the order was overly broad. It held that after applying the appropriate factors, the trial court correctly determined the zoning classification of the property was arbitrary and unreasonable if it failed to permit plaintiff's proposed use as a day care facility. However, upon invalidating the zoning ordinance as applied to the subject property, the trial court erred in reclassifying the zoning, rather than permitting plaintiff to develop the property as proposed. It properly dismissed the count alleging an improper taking of property under U.S. Const. amend. V because plaintiff was not deprived of all use of the land.

Defendant was sentenced to natural-life imprisonment, without parole, for aggravated criminal sexual assault, as a habitual criminal offender and also received concurrent extended-term sentences of 30 and 10 years for the offenses of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated battery.

The court held that defendant's sentence was proper.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in finding that he was not entitled to rescission because the arresting officer's testimony failed to confirm the validity of the breathalyzer certification, and failed to establish the police department's compliance with testing procedures. On appeal, the court disagreed and held that the petition was properly denied. Evidence of defendant's blood-alcohol content at the time of his arrest was not required by the statutory language of the summary suspension provision contained in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11--501.1, or by the summary suspension hearing provision of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 2--118.1. Rather, the relevant time of blood-alcohol content was the time at which defendant was tested. As a result, the trial court did not err in rejecting defendant's offer of proof on that issue. Defendant also failed to meet his burden of proving a prima facie case for rescission because he offered no evidence that his breathalyzer test was improperly administered, that the machine malfunctioned, or that the results were inaccurate. Thus, the summary suspension was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order denying defendant's petition for rescission of the summary suspension of his driving privileges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant resisted correctional officers attempting to physically force him into his cell, he kicked on of the officers in the chest and he died. Defendant was convicted of felony murder and aggravated battery. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for felony murder and held that the enhanced mental state of knowingly or intentionally committing a battery of a correctional institution employee known to be engaging in his official duties, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12 -- 4(b)(6) (1985), was not less culpable than consciously disregarding a substantial risk that one's acts would result in death or great bodily harm. The court held that the restoration hearing to determine defendant's fitness to stand trial did not offend minimal due process guarantees because the trial court accepted the stipulation to the psychiatrist's report and not merely his conclusion, weighing in-court observations and the report. The court ruled that the record was based on credible and substantial evidence and the jury was entitled to accept the state's expert testimony over defendant's expert witness regarding the correctional officer's cause of death.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 21-1(a) (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor damaged a car by walking on the roof. Because he had had prior difficulties, the trial court committed the minor to the juvenile division of department of corrections (DOC). On appeal, the minor contended that the trial court had abused its discretion when it sentenced him to an indeterminate term because he only had two misdemeanor thefts on his record and the trial court had not considered alternatives. The minor also argued that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 805 33(2) (1987), which prohibited a trial court from imposing a determinate-term sentence to DOC upon a minor violated the equal-protection clauses of the United States and Illinois Constitutions because the it permitted the commitment of minors for a longer period of time than similarly situated adults and was not precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that the trial court had not abused its discretion in making the commitment in light of the minor's behavioral history. Additionally, the court held that there was no equal protection violation because the law was open ended in its application and applied to all juveniles evenly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed conviction for two counts of attempted murder from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), contending that he was improperly tried in absentia, plain error occurred when the jury was incorrectly instructed on the mental state necessary to commit attempted murder, he did not receive effective assistance of counsel, and improper remarks by the trial judge constituted reversible error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although he appeared for arraignment and was instructed to appear at trial, defendant failed to appear. The trial court granted the state's motion for bond forfeiture, issued an arrest warrant, and continued the case for two days. When defendant did not appear, trial was held in absentia and he was found guilty of the attempted murders. The trial court denied defense counsel's post trial motion, and this appeal followed. On review, the court held that as defendant was personally present in an open court when the specific trial date was set and was apprised of his rights and the consequences of failure to appear, additional notice by certified mail was not required by 38 Ill. Comp. Stat. 115/4. Continuation of the trial was merely an additional safeguard. As to jury instructions, the court held that the jury could not reasonably have acquitted defendant of one attempted murder even if properly instructed on the issue of intent. Yet, with regard to the other attempted murder, it concluded that the evidence was not so clear as to defendant's intent to kill. Thus, it did not overcome the damage of the erroneous instructions, which constituted plain error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for one attempted murder. However, it reversed the conviction for the other attempted murder and remanded this case for a new trial on that charge.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 38, para. 10-1(a)(2) (1985), aggravated criminal sexual abuse, para 12-16(c)(1), unlawful restraint, para. 10-3(a), and residential burglary, para. 19-3(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered defendant's arguments on appeal and ruled as follows: 1) Although defendant waived his objection to the jury venire by not raising a written objection pursuant to Ill.

Stat. ch. 38, para. 114-3(b), he still failed to prove that the jury selection process violated his Sixth or Fourteenth Amendment rights because he failed to show that the representation of the venire group was not reasonable in relation to the number of persons in the community. 2) Defendant was not prejudiced by a witness referring to his photograph in a lineup as a &quot;booking photo&quot; because the trial court admonished the jury to disregard the reference and no further references were made. 3) The trial court did not err in refusing to suppress defendant's oral and written statements of confession because it had the discretion to give the testimony of the interrogating officers more credibility and the officers' testimony supported the conclusion that defendant's statements were voluntary. 4) The six-year-old victim was shown to be sufficiently competent to testify to defendant's identity. 5) The state proved the elements to convict defendant of residential burglary.</SPAN></P>

The insurer sought a refund of retaliatory taxes paid under protest, claiming that defendants had not shown that taxes in its home state were generally more onerous than Illinois taxes on foreign insurers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance department assessed a retaliatory tax against the foreign insurer under the Illinois Insurance Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 73, para 1056 (1987), which the foreign insurer paid under protest. The foreign insurer claimed that the tax was improper unless Illinois domiciled insurers were more heavily burdened by the tax formula of its domiciliary state than under Illinois law. The trial court disagreed, finding that the Illinois tax law was less burdensome on some foreign insurers than the law of the foreign insurer's domiciliary state. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, finding that it was unclear whether the foreign state's tax laws were invariably or generally more onerous than Illinois taxes on foreign insurers since taxes in the foreign state were calculated under various formulas, which resulted in retaliatory taxes being assessed at rates both higher and lower rates than those imposed by Illinois. The court held that the mere possibility of a higher tax under a foreign statute that was not actually applied to Illinois insurers was not a basis for assessing a retaliatory tax.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment finding paternity. The trial court denied the father's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and ordered the father to pay child support. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the mother's paternity complaint was not barred by the statute of limitations because the extended limitation period provided for in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 2508 (1985) applied. The court concluded that even though the statute was enacted only after the action was filed, the limitations provided for in the statute effectuated the clearly expressed intent of the legislature to provide children born of unwed parents up to 20 years in which to enforce their right to support in a paternity action. The court also concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of paternity because even though neither the mother nor the father's testimony was corroborated, the jury observed the witnesses and chose to believe the mother.

The court found that the consecutive life sentences were proper because defendant did not receive the death penalty when convicted of two or more counts of murder, his behavior was exceptionally brutal or heinous, and the public needed protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent parents appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, which denied the mother's motion for a new trial in petitioner State's case for wardship of the parties' children. The parents challenged the nature and extent of the evidence and the constitutionality of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, paras. 702-4(2), 705-1, 705-7 (1983), the provisions of the Juvenile Court Act upon which the removal of the children was based.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, after notification of an initial complaint of possible sexual abuse, filed a petition for wardship of the parents' two children, and placed the children in foster care. The trial court entered a finding of abuse as to each child and found a substantial risk of physical injury. The parents contended the statements that the State's witnesses attributed to the children constituted uncorroborated hearsay that violated their rights to due process of law. The court found that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37 para. 704-6(4)(c) (1983) did not deprive the parents of constitutional rights or violate due process. The court found the statements that the witnesses attributed to one of the children were corroborated by the child's trial testimony in chambers. The court found that, overall, the parents received a fair trial. The court found the standard of proof required only that it appear more likely than not that abuse occurred. The court held that it was satisfied that it did, that the father and mother were unable to provide a safe environment for the children, and that the trial court's findings and disposition were appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the findings of the trial court as to the father's abuse of the children, reversed the finding that the mother abused or knowingly allowed the abuse to occur, and affirmed the dispositional ruling that placed the children in foster care. The court found that the parents' rights were not terminated and one or both could regain custody at a later date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Adams County (Illinois), which, upon a jury verdict, convicted him of two counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault and one count of unlawful restraint, in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 12-14, 10-3, respectively. Defendant also appealed his concurrent sentences of 15 years in prison on each sexual assault conviction, and three years on the unlawful restraint conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant met the victim in a bar, and later raped her in her car and in his cousin's apartment. On appeal from his convictions and sentences for aggravated criminal sexual assault and unlawful restraint, defendant raised numerous points of error. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences for several reasons. First, the victim's testimony was clear and convincing. While she was feeling the effects of the alcohol, she was not so drunk as to not be aware of what was happening. Second, defendant's threats to kill the victim and throw her body in a river, plus the injuries, including the marks to her throat, were sufficient to establish that he acted in such a manner as to threaten or endanger her life. Third, the testimony about the rape trauma syndrome and whether the victim's conduct was consistent with that of someone suffering from it would be helpful to the fact finder on the question of consent, thus, there was no error in its admission. Fourth, the tape recording of the victim's initial telephone call to the police was properly admitted as a spontaneous declaration. Finally, the trial court did not consider good-time credit as a sentencing factor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant willfully failed to file a 1984 income tax return. According to the court, the evidence established that defendant was consciously aware that a failure to file his income tax return was practically certain to be caused by his conduct. The court also held that the jury was properly instructed. According to the court, all of defendant's tendered instructions were properly refused. The court determined that the jury was properly instructed as to the correct principles of law applicable to the evidence submitted to it. The court found that the information was sufficient because the information properly appraised defendant of the precise offense charged with sufficient specificity to prepare his defense and allow pleading a resulting conviction as a bar to future prosecution arising out of the same conduct. The court also held that the prosecution did not made any prejudicial comments. Finally, the court held that even if the 16th Amendment was improperly ratified, it did not affect the propriety of the tax, and the income tax on defendant's wages would pass constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

The officer appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which affirmed the board's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision. No eavesdropping occurred where an individual to whom statements were made or directed recorded them, even without the knowledge or consent of the person making the statements, because the declarant did not intend to keep his statements private vis-a-vis that individual. In this case, the officer did not commit eavesdropping in recording his conversation with his superior because the superior was speaking to the officer. Thus, there was no lawful order to surrender the tape and no grounds for the officer's discharge. The court rejected the board's argument that, even if the officer did not commit eavesdropping, he nonetheless violated his superior's reasonable expectation of privacy in their conversation. The officer had been charged with committing the criminal offense of eavesdropping and not merely with violating or breaching a superior's reasonable expectation of privacy in confidential communications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder. He did not pull the trigger, but he obtained the gun and actively participated in planning the murder. The victim, suspected of being an informant by defendant and his fellow thugs, was shot in the head two or three times while facedown on the ground. Several days after the murder, defendant and the others burned the body. Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to 60 years. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. During trial, defendant's lawyer claimed he had a lawyer-client relationship with the State's witness and a social relationship with the parents of the witness and argued that the relationships would make difficult cross-examination of the witness. The court affirmed the decision of the lower court, which found that the motion was not timely, the attorney was not representing the witness in any matter at the time, the attorney did not claim a problem with confidentiality, and no actual conflict was shown. Therefore, the court stated that there was no need to attack the believability of the witness in cross-examination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought a declaratory judgment action against defendants after defendants denied their application for a special use permit to open a restaurant on their property. The trial court found the county zoning ordinance constitutional, granted plaintiffs a special use permit, and imposed a restriction on the permit that at least 80 per cent of the restaurant's business had to be food service. Plaintiffs argued that the ordinance as applied to them was unconstitutionally vague and that the restrictions imposed by the trial court did not bear a real and substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in part and reversed it in part. The ordinance was constitutional. While it did not define the words &quot;restaurant,&quot; &quot;bar,&quot; and &quot;nightclub,&quot; plaintiffs could read the ordinance and realize that they needed a special use permit for the establishment they envisioned. The 80 per cent food service restriction was against the manifest weight of the evidence and bore no real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss, and denied the licensee's motions for reconsideration and for leave to amend. The court affirmed, holding that the counts of misrepresentation were not timely filed under &sect; 9-4 of the Liquor Control Act of 1934 and held that the lack of actual notice did not constitute a denial of due process. The court held that the licensee had failed to file a legally sufficient petition within the 30 days prescribed by &sect; 23-24 of the Election Code, and consequently, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the licensee's motion to amend.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the jury instructions were inadequate because they required defendant to prove consent beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the State's evidence sufficiently established &quot;non-consent&quot; beyond a reasonable doubt because, where the State proved defendant used force, it necessarily proved the victim did not consent. Moreover, even if it were error to omit the consent instruction, it was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court instructed the jury on the elements of aggravated criminal sexual assault and on the defense of consent, the presumption of innocence, and the State's burden. Overall, the instructions fully and fairly defined the applicable law. Defendant was eligible for an extended-term sentence because he previously was convicted of rape and aggravated kidnapping. There was no double enhancement where &quot;bodily harm&quot; was an element of the offense because the aggravating factor for sentencing purposes required &quot;serious harm&quot; under Ill. Rev.

Plaintiff asserted that the trial court erred in considering her activities prior to the running of the statute of limitations in ruling on defendant's motion to dismiss under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 103(b), 107 Ill. 2d R. 103(b).</SPAN></P>

The statute of limitations ran on March 2, 1987. Plaintiff's action was dismissed for want of prosecution, but, for reasons unknown, the trial court permitted plaintiff to nonsuit the action. Plaintiff immediately refiled the action. The summons was issued more than 24 months after plaintiff filed the original complaint and 6 months after the statute of limitations ran. The trial court granted the driver's motion to vacate for failure to use reasonable diligence to effectuate service. Plaintiff appealed, and the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that Rule 103(b), which provided that failure to exercise reasonable diligence to obtain service after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations resulted in dismissal with prejudice, would not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of abuse of discretion and that plaintiff failed to make such a showing. The court held that due diligence in serving process was essential to the administration of justice and that plaintiff's prompt refiling did not benefit the driver because the driver was not put on notice of the suit.</SPAN></P>

The court found that a person exercising exclusive unexplained possession over a stolen vehicle or an essential part of a stolen vehicle had knowledge that such vehicle or essential part was stolen. Possession of the tire and hubcaps was possession of &quot;essential parts.&quot; Moreover, where the identification of defendant was at issue, the testimony of a single witness, a police officer, was sufficient to support defendant's conviction even in the presence of alibi testimony because the witness was credible and had viewed defendant under circumstances that would permit positive identification. The test for a positive identification was whether the witness was close enough to defendant for a sufficient length of time, under circumstances that provided adequate opportunity for observation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction of murder and sentence to 68 years in prison was affirmed, then defendant filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief that was denied.

The court affirmed the trial court's order denying defendant's motion to reconsider the dismissal of his petition. The court held that (1) defendant failed to raise and waived the issue of trial counsel's incompetence because he had different counsel on appeal; (2) ineffective assistance of counsel was not established; (3) appellate counsel was not incompetent for raising only one issue because an attorney was not required to raise unmeritorious issues; (4) there was no conflict between the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 122-2.1 (1985), and Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 651(c), 107 Ill. 2d R. 651(c) regarding an indigent's appointment of counsel; and (5) a mandatory 30-day period for dismissing a post-conviction petition did not apply to a motion for reconsideration and written findings of fact and conclusions of law were also not required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bank and trust company filed suit against the municipality contending that the Board of Trustees had erred in overruling the Plan Commission and in granting a developer a special use permit to build a five-story office building located in the municipality's office research district, a zoning district created under the zoning ordinance. The bank and trust company contended that, under the special use provisions of the zoning ordinance, the Board was prohibited from granting site plan approval after the Commission's negative recommendation. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment for the municipality and concluded that provisions of the zoning ordinance demonstrated that the Board was the body that determined whether to grant or deny a site plan approval. The recommendations by the Commission were only advisory, and the final approval authority was vested in the Board. The court held that proper procedures were following in granting modifications to the requisites of the office research district and concluded that the bank and trust company had failed to establish that the site plan approval did not comply with the requirements of the zoning district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial judge abused his discretion in finding the complaining witness competent to testify. Defendant also challenged the trial court's order assessing costs of a transcript on appeal against his bond proceeds. Upon review, the court held that the trial court improperly assessed defendant for the cost of the transcript. Because the controlling factor was the degree of intelligence, not the child's chronological age, it was irrelevant that the victim did not possess the intelligence of an average 13-year-old. The proper inquiry was what intelligence she did possess and whether she met the criteria for determining competency of a witness. Considering the totality of the complaining witness' testimony and the trend to allow testimony, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the testimony to stand. Even if the complaining witness had not testified, the overwhelming weight of the remaining evidence would have supported the verdict. Because the trial court lacked authority to seize the bond proceeds to pay for the transcript, defendant did not waive that issue by failing to object at trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for aggravated criminal sexual assault, reversed the order to pay the costs of the transcript from defendant's bond proceeds, and remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions to refund to defendant the sum of $ 48.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 139, para. 321 et seq. (1985) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs contended, in part, that the trial court erred in disqualifying their attorney in their case against defendants, township and supervisor, which challenged the constitutionality of Township Open Space Act (Act) Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 139, par. 321 et seq. (1985). Though plaintiffs' attorney did not provide legal services or advice to defendant township, the court found that an attorney-client relationship had formed between defendant township and the plaintiffs' attorney during an initial interview which concerned the possibility of the attorney's representation of defendant township in its open-space acquisition program. The relationship was sufficient to justify defendants' invocation of Ill. Code of Prof'l Resp. (Code) Canons 4 and 9, which required a lawyer to preserve the confidences of a client and cautioned against even the appearance of professional impropriety. As the court found that an attorney-client relationship existed, it next considered whether disqualification was required. The court found that disqualification was proper under both the Code, as well as federal cases, on the ground that the subject matter of both representations was essentially the same.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that the requested information did not fall within the exemptions under the Illinois FOIA and granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgement.

After a jury found for the mother, the trial court entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the evidence so overwhelmingly favored the police chief that the verdict for the mother could not stand. The court ruled that, although he acted under color of state law, the mother failed to demonstrate that any of the police chief's policies violated the son's 14th amendment right not to be deprived of his life without due process. The court ruled that the police chief's knowledge that the son was violent, intoxicated, and disorderly was not a reason to know or suspect that his violence might become self-directed. The court found that the failure to obtain a medical exam, despite the son's intoxication, and violation of procedures to check the cells every half hour were perhaps negligent, but were not a deliberate disregard for the son's well being or safety so as to violate his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlords sued defendant village in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), challenging the validity and constitutionality of certain sections of the village's landlord-tenant ordinance. The trial court held the ordinance unconstitutional and invalid. The village appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village passed Mount Prospect, Ill., Ordinance 3366, &sect; 23.1801 (1983) which regulated relations between landlords and tenants and included provisions that allowed tenants to withhold rents for building violations, charged a licensing fee, and required landlords to be licensed. The landlords sued the village, contending that the ordinance was unconstitutional, that the regulation was not a valid exercise of the village's police power, and that the license fee charged was unreasonable. The village filed an answer to the complaint and also filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that the Ordinance was valid. The trial court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional, and thus, invalid. On appeal, the court held that the ordinance was a valid regulation and was within the ordinance's stated purpose to protect and promote the public health, safety, and welfare of its citizens. The court further found that the ordinance contained genuine regulatory provisions, the fee was valid unless unreasonable, and there had been no such showing by the landlords particularly as the fee did not even cover all the costs of regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vending corporation applied for a business license. It had been denied a license the previous year, which had been appealed to the state and federal courts and dismissed. The licenses were denied on the basis of the vending corporation's link with organized crime, previous falsifications of applications, and the criminal record of one of the corporate officials. The vending corporation challenged the both denials in the trial court. The trial court upheld the first denial but remanded the second after it found that a portion of the village ordinance was unconstitutional. After remand, it was again denied. The vending corporation sought review in the trial court, which upheld the denial on the basis of the falsifications. The vending corporation appealed both denials as being against the manifest weight of evidence. Defendants argued that res judicata applied because of the previous dismissals. The court found that that the previous suits had been dismissed because of the current suit and by agreement of the parties, thus, res judicata did not apply. The court also found that there was sufficient evidence in the record to uphold the decision of the order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the record did not support defendant's allegation that the State exercised its peremptory challenges in a manner that violated the Equal Protection Clause because the State did not exercise a &quot;pattern&quot; of challenges and because no evidence that could have raised an inference of purposeful discrimination was presented. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant probation to defendant and in sentencing him to four years' imprisonment because of the offense's seriousness and because of defendant's denial of guilt.</SPAN></P>

Further, requiring him to pay the jury fee did not result in an unconstitutional denial of due process or equal protection because no fundamental interest of the individual was gained or lost depending on the availability of a jury trial.

The court held that defendants were not denied a fair trial as a result of the prosecutor's comments because there was evidence to support the prosecutor's contention concerning when defendants became suspects.

Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1401(b)(2) (1987) by selling 6.9 grams of a substance containing cocaine. The trial court sentenced him to five years' imprisonment. Defendant argued that &sect; 5-5-3(c)(2)(D) of the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3(c)(2)(D), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after selling cocaine to an undercover police officer. On appeal, defendant contended that there was no rational reason for punishing a person convicted of delivering over five grams of cocaine more severely than persons convicted of delivering other substances such as heroin, morphine, barbiturates, or amphetamines. He therefore argued that his punishment violated equal protection. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court noted that the legislature had wide discretion in classifying offenses and providing penalties for them. The court determined that absent a fundamental right or a suspect classification, the legislature could treat similarly situated persons differently if a rational reason existed for doing so. The court found that the legislative history of &sect; 5-5-3(c)(2)(D) of the Code clearly established that the legislature was particularly concerned with the easy availability of cocaine. The court concluded that &sect; 5-5-3(c)(2)(D) was constitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant racing board sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which declared Illinois Racing Board Rule 25.19, Ill. Admin. Code tit. 11, &sect; 1325.190 (1985), unconstitutional on its face and reversed its decision suspending the occupation license of plaintiff horse trainer for refusing to consent to a search of a truck allegedly within his control at a race track.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the racing board contended that the trial court erred in finding Illinois Racing Board Rule 25.19, Ill. Admin. Code tit. 11, &sect; 1325.190 (1985) unconstitutional on its face. In the alternative, the racing board argued that if the trial court was correct in finding the rule unconstitutional, it erred in awarding the horse trainer attorney fees and costs under &sect; 14.1(b) of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 1014.1(b) (1987). Upon review, the court affirmed trial court's judgment. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 11, &sect; 1325.190 (1985) was unconstitutional because it did not properly limit the discretion of the inspecting officers. The rule failed to set forth appropriate times for inspections or the frequency of inspections, or the proper method for choosing who is subject to a search at a given time. Another cases' holding did not indicate that the court in that case found &sect; 1325.190 invalid or unconstitutional on its face. Therefore, the holding in that case did not preclude an award of attorney fees and costs under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 1014.1(b) (1987) in the instant case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Some property owners entered into a contract to sell land to the developer's predecessor. The contract was contingent upon the owners securing rezoning to permit a townhouse development. The city denied the owners' petition for rezoning, but the court rendered an opinion in favor of the owners that allowed the proposed use. The city adopted certain ordinances after the court's opinion but before the trial court's judgment order. The ordinances substantially increased building permit fees and imposed new fees applicable to townhouse developments. The city refused to issue a building permit to the developer until the new fees were paid. The developer brought an action against the city to recover the increase in the fees, and the trial court denied the developer's motion for summary judgment and granted the city's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court reversed the trial court's decision with regard to the motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court held that the city improperly sought to control or affect the result of the underlying litigation after it was adjudicated by the courts, and that the developer was subject to the fees as of the time of the court's mandate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with mob action and the trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss.

On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court found that the judge, who was the trier of fact in the case, could reasonably have concluded that a crowd formed in response to defendant's shouting and joined her in yelling, &quot;don't let him or them take that man away.&quot; He could further have inferred that defendant intended or at least knew that her exhortation to the crowd was likely to result in the interference of an arrest. The trial judge heard testimony describing the circumstances surrounding the incident and could reasonably have found that the police had not yet arrested the individual when defendant began shouting, and that the disturbance she caused did result in interference with this arrest.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced them to 30 years for the armed robbery and life for the murder. Defendants sought review. The court held that, pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. VI, the requirement of presence of counsel at a lineup extended to any adversary judicial criminal proceedings, whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment. The court held that, for there to have been a valid waiver of counsel, there must have first been a complete admonition to defendants of their right to counsel and the consequences of asserting or relinquishing such right and then there must have been a knowledgeable and voluntary waiver of such right. The court held that defendants had knowingly and voluntarily waived such rights. The court held that defendants had the right to waive the jury for the separate sentencing proceeding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested, charged with unlawful use of weapons, and charged under a city ordinance with failure to register a deadly weapon and unlawful possession of fireworks. The trial court suppressed the evidence on constitutional grounds and quashed the arrest. The trial court ruled that defendant had a property right in the guns, but that he could not lawfully possess them within the city under the city ordinance. Therefore, the trial court ordered the weapons returned to defendant outside the city. The state appealed, contending that the property was contraband per se because at the time of the seizure mere possession by defendant constituted a violation of the city ordinances. Defendant countered that a gun alone was not contraband per se. The court reversed, remanded with directions to confiscate the weapons, and held that the trial court erred in ordering the return of the weapons outside the city because the weapons constituted contraband per se. An illegally possessed weapon violating registration requirements resembles other contraband per se items such as counterfeit money and illegal narcotics.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendant and codefendant gave inculpatory statements to the police but, at trial, defendant claimed that his statement was not intelligently made or true while the codefendant denied making any incriminating statement.

The court also noted that trial counsel's decision not to seek a severance or to file a motion to suppress either statement related to trial strategy and that such decisions did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel. With regard to the admission of a letter written by the victim, the court found that the letter's admission into evidence was not prejudicial when it was cumulative to the victim's testimony at trial and when that testimony was corroborated by the oral admissions of both defendant and codefendant.</SPAN></P>

Because of the mother's illness, the baby was taken from her at birth. Then, the baby was adjudicated a neglected and dependent minor. Later, the State filed a petition to terminate the mother's parental rights. The trial court found the mother unfit in that she failed to make reasonable progress toward the baby's return within 12 months after baby's adjudication, and in that the mother was unable to discharge her parental responsibilities due to mental illness. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding the evidence sufficient in that the record indicated that the State's witness psychiatrist and the mother's witness psychologist both testified that the mother could not independently discharge her parental duties and that her inability would continue for at least a few years. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in terminating the mother's parental rights due to unfitness resulting from mental illness.

Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 704(e) (1985). His sentence included a fine in the amount of $ 2,594.50 pursuant to &sect; 5-9-1.1 of the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-9-1.1 (1985). Defendant sought review of his conviction and sentence. The court affirmed. The court noted that &sect; 5-9-1.1 provided for the imposition of a &quot;street value&quot; penalty on persons found guilty of drug-related offenses. At sentencing, the State argued that this section mandated the imposition of a fine against defendant for the full street value. Defendant maintained that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 710.1 (1985) applied instead. That section granted the trial court the discretion to set the amount of the fine, the court noted. The court approved of the trial court's adoption of the State's argument. The court held that the legislative history of ch. 56 1/2, para. 710.1 showed that the General Assembly had no intention of supplementing the mandatory requirement of &sect; 5-9-1.1. The court also found that no double enhancement could have occurred here.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was found guilty of reckless homicide and driving under the influence of alcohol. On appeal, defendant claimed that the instruction given under Ill. Rev.

The court agreed. The court held that the jury was not instructed that it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the amount of alcohol in defendant's blood was .10 percent or more before it could presume that defendant was under the influence of alcohol. That fact was the factual predicate for the presumption of intoxication. The mandatory presumption was improper.

Admin. Code tit. 77, &sect; 200.906 (1986), following an inspection by defendant Illinois Department of Public Health, which found deadbolt and other locks on certain doors in order to keep mental patients from wandering away.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensed nursing home was cited for several violations of the 1967 National Fire Protection Association Life Safety Code (Code) by the department, after two inspections showed the same problem with exiting the facility in an emergency. Following administrative proceedings, the department assessed a $ 5,000 penalty and imposed a six-month conditional license. The nursing home sought administrative review. The trial court confirmed the agency decision. The nursing home argued that: (1) the findings as to the violations were against the manifest weight of the evidence; (2) classifying them as the most serious or Type A violations was abuse of discretion; (3) the statutory nursing home inspection provisions were unconstitutional; (4) the department agents exceeded their authority by conducting an unreasonable inspection; and (5) the hearing officer abused his discretion in not admitting certain evidence. The court reversed as to the finding of Type A violations and consequent penalty, reducing them to Type B and remanding for consideration of an appropriate penalty.

In addition, the city had yet to file an answer to the complaint so that it was impossible to adequately review the city's arguments.

There was nothing of record which supported a claim that the inference permitted by the statute was applied to defendant by the trial judge. The matter of presumptions and prima facie case were never mentioned during the bench trial, in closing arguments, or by the judge in reciting his findings of fact. To the contrary, the trial court relied on the specific content of defendant's statements to the girls in determining the State proved the requisite unlawful intent.

After the filing of tax objections and a hearing on the People of Illinois's application for judgment, the circuit court entered judgment against all of the taxpayers, refusing to order any refunds. The taxpayers appealed objecting to the constitutionality of Public Act 82-121, 1981 Ill. Laws 853. The taxpayers contended that they were deprived of due process, that a portion of Public Act 82-121 was unconstitutional, and that they were entitled to a complete refund of the taxes paid under protest together with interest at 5 percent per annum. The court found that the taxpayers' complaint stemmed from changed assessments. The court concluded that the administrative procedure regulating assessment challenges required a written complaint to the board of review. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 589(4) (1981). The court found that the taxpayers' objections failed to note a written complaint, stating instead their contact with the supervisor of assessments resulted in being told there was nothing local assessing officers could do regarding the assessment changes.</SPAN></P>

A subsequent revenue ruling provided that use of a clothes washing machine, where the possession of the machine did not transfer, but where a charge was made for the period of use of the machine by the user, was taxable under &sect; 200.1-2. The laundromat owners alleged that the ordinance constituted an unconstitutional service tax. The trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss and the laundromat owners appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the ordinance as applied to the laundromat owners constituted a valid tax on the rental of personal property. Because the washing machines were not merely incidental to the laundromat service, the tax was not an unconstitutional service tax. The court also found that the city was not estopped from enforcing the ordinance against the laundromat owners, and that &sect; 200.1-2 did not limit the taxation of leased time transactions solely to leases of office-type equipment.</SPAN></P>

He was not directly materially affected by the provision and was not in immediate danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the enforcement of the Act. The court addressed the constitutional question because the issue could recur in other actions brought by residents of the county. The court held that the distinction in &sect; 39.2(h) for cities and counties of a certain size was not special legislation because it was rational to conclude that the environmental problems of the county and municipalities were different from those in other cities and counties.</SPAN></P>

There was no suggestion that the seals on the evidence envelopes had been tampered with before the analyst received them, the samples remained under the agent's control until he personally handed them to the analyst, and the seals were intact on both evidence envelopes when received by the analyst. In addition, there was a reasonable probability that the evidence had not been altered or contaminated in any way, even though the agent could not recall exactly where the evidence was at all times. The court also found that defendant's hypothetical questions regarding whether moisture would affect cocaine were properly restricted, as the theory was merely speculative, was beyond the scope of cross-examination, and there was no basis for his hypothetical questions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the child was six, her mother filed an action to establish that the individual was the child's father. Because the Illinois Paternity Act, Ill. Rev.

Subsequently, the Illinois Paternity Act was held unconstitutional. On appeal, the child and the Department argued that the trial court erred in dismissing their action. Upon review, the court reversed and remanded the trial court's judgment. The mother was not acting in the child's best interest when she filed the paternity action four years late. There was no privity between the mother and the child when the mother filed the action. The child did not have a cause of action under the Illinois Paternity Act and could not have maintained an action against the individual under that Act. Therefore, &sect; 25 of the Illinois Parentage Act could not have barred the child's action. The Department was not furnishing financial assistance to either the child or her mother in 1981.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Chicago Housing Authority (housing authority) appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which vacated the dismissal of plaintiff resident's second amended complaint and granted the resident leave to file a third amended complaint. The housing authority claimed that the Illinois Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, para. 3-106 (1985), applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident was a child who lived in a public housing project and was injured while playing at a public playground provided by the housing authority. The resident filed an action against the housing authority alleging that his injuries were caused by unsafe conditions at the playground, of which the housing authority was aware. The resident was granted leave to file a third-amended complaint. The housing authority appealed and claimed that it was immune from suit under the &sect; 3-106, because the resident failed to allege willful and wanton conduct on the part of the housing authority. The court held that the Act applied. The housing authority, by providing the playground, was performing a governmental function, and not a proprietary function. The power of the housing authority to plan and maintain playgrounds for their residents was within the spirit and meaning of the Housing Authorities Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 67 1/2, para. 8.2 (1985), even though not specifically mentioned therein.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that vacated the dismissal of the second-amended complaint and granted leave to file a third-amended complaint. The court dismissed the resident's action for injuries sustained at a public playground, but denied the housing authority's motion for attorney fees and costs.</SPAN></P>

The trial court reasoned that because the husband and the wife were residents of Louisiana, their claim was barred by Louisiana's one-year statute of limitations. The husband and the wife argued that the manufacturer's principle place of business was in Illinois and that application of the borrowing statute was improper. The court disagreed and found that based on Illinois law, the state of incorporation established the residency of the manufacturer. As a result, Delaware was the residence of the manufacturer and application of the borrowing statute was proper.</SPAN></P>

The gasoline caught fire, resulting in the death of six of the family members. He was convicted of murder and aggravated arson. The court affirmed the murder conviction, finding that defendant's conduct before and after the fire negated his statements that he did not intend to harm the children or damage the house, as he told his wife that he was going to burn the house down and that he was going to burn up the family members, he borrowed a gasoline can and purchased gasoline, and he deliberately poured gasoline throughout the house. Further, defendant was not entitled to an instruction on involuntary manslaughter, as the evidence did not support the contention that defendant acted recklessly in performing the actions that caused the deaths. The aggravated arson conviction was vacated, however, as the statute under which defendant was convicted was unconstitutional. The legislature intended that the statute provide for an aggravated form of arson and that the factors would enhance the offense from simple arson to aggravated arson; however, it failed to define an underlying offense.</SPAN></P>

The worker claimed that he was injured because defendants failed to provide a safe, suitable, and proper support for a bundle of storage racks which tipped over onto the worker, causing severe and permanent injury to his left knee. The court held that the Act was intended to cover and applied to construction site support devices whether used to support material or workmen.

The trial court also determined that the annexation amendment to &sect; 7-1-13 of the Illinois Municipal Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 7-1-13 (1985), was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants amended the annexation statute to permit the annexation of unincorporated territories of less than 60 acres located within counties having a population of more than 400,000 and bounded by a creek. The owner brought an action, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief and challenging the constitutionality of the amendment. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, and the trial court granted defendants' motion. On appeal, the court held that the annexation amendment did not constitute special legislation pursuant to Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13. The court found that the owner failed to satisfy his burden of showing that the placing of counties with a larger population into a separate class was unreasonable and arbitrary. There was no evidence that it was more difficult for lesser-populated counties to obtain a majority vote for voluntary annexation. Moreover, the court found that the population classification bore a reasonable relationship to the amendment's purpose of allowing involuntary annexation. The court also rejected the owner's contention that the amendment's use of a creek as a boundary was vague, finding that the creek's description was sufficient notice.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his conviction by alleging, inter alia, that the trial court improperly excluded evidence pursuant to the Illinois rape shield statute, Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought to introduce evidence that the complainant told him during an intimate conversation prior to the sexual acts that she had recently had an abortion. The trial court excluded the evidence pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-7 (1985). Reversing the conviction on appeal, the court held that the evidence was not rendered inadmissible by the rape-shield statute because it was not offered to prove the complainant's prior sexual activities. Rather, the proffered evidence would have corroborated defendant's claim that the complaint consented. The court also held that the prosecutor's accusation that defendant was discharged from the Navy for larceny presented another ground for reversal. The court held that defendant's being charged with larceny was not the equivalent of a criminal conviction. Thus, it was not admissible against defendant. Moreover, if defendant had been convicted, the prosecution could not cross-examine defendant about the crime. The court rejected defendant's contention that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-14(a)(2) (1985), was unconstitutional, finding that defendant was not treated differently from those committing crimes of a similar quality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner alleged that the department, in constructing an overpass directly above that portion of the highway which used to front his property, (1) trespassed by parking construction vehicles on his property; (2) eliminated the air, light, and view serving his property; and (3) eliminated the practical access from his property to the highway. On the landowner's amended petition, the trial court issued a writ of mandamus compelling the secretary to institute eminent domain proceedings to compensate the landowner for the taking and damaging of his property. The secretary and department appealed. The court reversed, holding that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to issue the writ because the land had been damaged but not &quot;taken&quot; within the meaning of Ill. Const. art, I, &sect; 15. The landowner's sole remedy against the state, the court concluded, was to bring an action for damages in the court of claims pursuant to its exclusive jurisdiction under Ill. Rev.

The property owner challenged the zoning ordinance's validity under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 3-11-17 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Village brought an action for injunctive relief, alleging that the property owner violated the zoning ordinance in not obtaining a special use permit and in keeping 33 horses on the property. The trial court found that the Village complied with the procedural requirements in enacting the zoning ordinance. The trial court enjoined the property owner from operating the stable until she obtained a special use permit. On appeal, after deciding that the issue of the zoning ordinance's validity was properly before it, the court held that Mettawa, Ill., Ordinance 76-0-3 (1976) was void and unenforceable because the Village did not comply with the requirements set forth in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 3-11-17 (1975). The court found that for the zoning ordinance to be valid, the record had to show that the roll call vote was taken and the vote of each trustee. The court found that the minutes from the meeting at which the zoning ordinance was enacted did not show the vote of each trustee or that the roll call vote was taken. The court also found that the affidavit supporting the record was insufficient because it was prepared almost 11 years after the zoning ordinance was enacted.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, remanded for appointment of a guardian ad litem, and held that the retroactive application of the statute of limitations did not result in a harsh and oppressive result and, therefore, did not deny the father due process because he had a reasonable time period in which to file his claim, that the statutory classification in para. 2508 was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose and therefore did not violate equal protection, and that the trial court had an obligation to appoint a guardian.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged, convicted, and sentenced on two counts of home invasion, and one count each of aggravated criminal sexual assault, aggravated kidnapping, kidnapping, and aggravated battery. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erroneously refused to allow a psychologist to give an opinion as an expert or lay witness in support of defendant's insanity defense. The witness proffered by defendant was not qualified to give an expert opinion. Given the witness' relationship to defendant, the duration of her interview with him, and the remoteness of time between the offenses and interview, the trial court's refusal to allow her to give a lay opinion was not an abuse of discretion. The statute placing the burden of proof of insanity on defendant and specifying the instruction to be given the jury on that defense was not unconstitutional, and there was no basis for instructing the jury on guilty but mentally ill. It was improper to convict defendant of two aggravated felonies where the two underlying felonies were committed at the same time and each served to enhance the other.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that after a three-member panel of the commission entered an order and decision adopting the administrative law judge's recommendations, the former employee should have sought a rehearing before the entire commission, so dismissal of his appeal was appropriate because the exhaustion of remedies rule precluded the court's review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants alleged that evidence was obtained in a warrantless search in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights. Defendants had rented a separate area contained within a country club for a private party. The city police received information that gambling was occurring in the club. They made a liquor check and observed certain items, which they seized and the State intended to introduce into evidence. The trial court found that the entry was warrantless and that the officers entered, not to inspect for a liquor violation, but to determine if gambling occurred on the premises. The State contended that because the country club was licensed by the State and by the City to sell alcoholic beverages, it was subject to inspection and search without a warrant. The court held that: (1) the undisputed evidence showed that the purpose of the search was solely to look for gambling activities on the premises, not to further any purpose under &sect; 10--8 of the Liquor Control Act of 1934, Ill.

The trial court denied defendant's motion for a severance. The court vacated in part and reversed in part the trial court's decision. Defendant's conviction was largely based on the testimony of his co-defendant's sister. The court determined that the mandatory life provisions was not unconstitutional. It was error for the trial court to restrict defendant's attorney's cross-examination of a witness because the principal issue concerned the identification of defendant and his attorney would have been given wide latitude on cross-examination. The trial court improperly accepted the State's offer of proof and defendant did not take a position that constituted a knowing waiver of the right to bar certain evidence by making his own offer of proof. Because it was a denial of due process for the trier of fact to consider evidence untested by cross-examination or contrary to the rules of evidence, reversible error occurred.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complainant charged defendants with negligence in leaving him at an arrest scene where he was subsequently attacked by a friend of the arrestee. The trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. On appeal, the complainant argued that the judicially created &quot;special duty&quot; exception to the tort immunity of police officers was improperly formulated, against public policy, and against the Tort Immunity Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, para. 9-103 (1985). The court affirmed the trial court, finding that defendants owed no special duty to the complainant. The control element of the special duty exception to the tort immunity of police officers outweighed the public noninvolvement consideration advanced by the complainant. While the court agreed with the complainant's position as an ideal one in fostering the assistance of the public citizenry in apprehending criminals, it appeared to be an impossible one in light of the burden that would have been imposed on the police to accomplish the ideal relationship.

The court held that his conviction for attempt was vacated because of the incomplete judgment entered by the trial court. The court found that the jury was adequately apprised of the elements of the offense of aggravated criminal sexual assault, since the state needed not prove the type of sexual penetration as an element of the offense. The court held that the trial judge's questions that regarded defendant's past and his employment were proper because the questions related to defendant's potential for rehabilitation.

Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained following a warrantees entry into his hotel room by a police officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Acting on information from hotel personnel, a police officer entered a hotel room to check on a suitcase containing what was thought to be cocaine. The officer was told that the occupant of the room, the defendant, had checked out. The defendant appeared at the room and consented to the officer's search of the suitcase, claiming that the suitcase was not his. Finding that the suitcase contained contraband, later discovered to be cocaine, the officer arrested the defendant. The defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. On appeal, the court found that the warrantless search of the defendant's hotel room was not justified by exigent circumstances or by the hotel supervisor's authority to allow the officer into the room because she believed the room to be vacant. The court rejected the state's argument that the presence of cocaine in the room posed a danger to hotel employees. Holding the search unlawful, the court also examined inculpatory statements made by the defendant at the time of his arrest. The court held that these statements should have been suppressed because they were not made voluntarily.</SPAN></P>

The Department appealed the adverse judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department issued the oil company a permit to build a service station on the oil company's property, which abutted a freeway. The permit was conditioned on the oil company's agreement that it would not seek additional compensation from the Department in the event a portion of the property was condemned for use of the freeway. The Department condemned a portion of the property, closed the oil company's driveways, and sought to enforce the agreement. The trial court denied enforcing it. In affirming the denial, the court held that the agreement was void and unenforceable. The court found that the purpose of the condition was solely to depress the property value in anticipation of future acquisition. The court stated that the statute that allowed the Department to prohibit abutting property owners from constructing access driveways to a freeway was intended to promote the safety and convenience of highway traffic and eliminate the danger of accidents. Conditions proscribing surfacing, dimensions, and illumination might serve such a purpose; however, it was clearly not served by a condition that solely sought to depress the value of condemned property.</SPAN></P>

The court found nothing unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious about the county zoning ordinance's definition of the term &quot;junk yard.&quot; The court stated that the fact that the used cars and parts on the landowner's lot had commercial value did not serve to remove it from the definition of &quot;junk yard.&quot; The court concluded that the county's definition of the term &quot;junk yard&quot; was neither unauthorized by law nor arbitrary, unreasonable, discriminatory, or confiscatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Doctors performed back surgery on the patient. She filed a malpractice claim against them and the hospital in 1983. The doctors were not served until 1985. After several continuances, the trial court granted the doctor's motion to dismiss for lack of due diligence in effecting service and it granted the hospital's motion for summary judgment, finding it demonstrated adequacy of medical care and that the patient had not taken steps toward acquiring discovery from the hospital or obtaining an expert. The trial court denied the patient's motions to vacate the orders. Thus, she appealed. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion nor did it deprive her of due process by denying further continuances because the patient's attorney agreed to a final date for the hearing and did not comply. Further, the doctors' motions were properly granted based on the doctors' proof of an obvious place of business and the patient presented no basis for the delay in service. Also, the hospital showed that the patient had not taken steps to proceed in the case. The court further concluded that it was highly doubtful that any amendment would have aided her on the diligence issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that the trial evidence established that the city council passed the ordinance without any meaningful deliberation and without being informed that the means employed by the ordinance would accomplish the ordinance's stated purpose, or what effect the ordinance would have on the licensed mobile food vendors. The effect of the ordinance was not to further the purpose of the District but instead was to summarily revoke the mobile food vendor licenses, without notice and a hearing as required under the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 (1982), and the Municipal Code of Chicago. No evidence was presented to establish that mobile food vendor vehicles had any impact upon the District's performance of its purposes to provide care for the sick and injured and for the study of diseases. The substance of the defense testimony was that the mobile food vendor vehicles' presence in the District was cosmetically offensive. Thus, the ordinance constituted arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable municipal action, there was no permissible interpretation which justified its adoption and it was not directly related to the stated purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which declined to apply &sect; 513 of the Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 513 (1985), to provide for the educational needs of a nonminor, illegitimate child in a parentage proceeding against respondent father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After paternity and the child support obligation were established, the mother filed a petition for an order under &sect; 513 requiring the father to pay their daughter's college expenses. The trial court dismissed the petition because the Parentage Act made no provision for the payment of such expenses. The mother argued that the failure to apply &sect; 513 constituted an arbitrary differentiation between legitimate and illegitimate children in violation of the constitutional guarantees of equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The court held that when read together the Parentage Act and Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act authorized a court making a child support award to include provisions for the payment of educational expenses for nonminor, illegitimate children. Despite the absence of a specific statutory provision, the legislature had manifested an intent to treat all children equally in matters of support in &sect; 3 of the Parentage Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 2503 (1985).The court's construction gave effect to the legislative intent without the need to address the mother's equal protection challenge.</SPAN></P>

Indictment on all state charges was not required if sufficient notice of the offense charged was given to the accused and he was afforded protection from invalid accusations. Double jeopardy concepts did not bar defendant's trial after the dismissal of three counts. The court found that the date of the offense was not an essential ingredient in child sex offenses. Because the date was not a material part of the offense charged, and defendant was not prejudiced by proof of a varying date, he was not denied a fair trial by the variance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had his probation revoked and was sentenced to imprisonment after admitted to the allegations contained in a petition to revoke probation. On appeal, defendant argued that (1) the two-year sentence of imprisonment was excessive; (2) the penalty provided in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 6-303(d) (1985) was disproportionate to the offense of driving with a revoked license and was, therefore, unconstitutional; and (3) the two-year sentence should have included a credit for time served while defendant was on probation. Upon review, the court found defendant's arguments without merit. The sentence of a term of imprisonment was not an abuse of discretion. Defendant's record showed an ongoing disrespect for the law. Twice defendant had been ordered to serve a period of time in the county jail. None of those punishments seemed to impress on him the importance of obeying the law. Challenging the constitutionality of a statute was not properly done for the first time on appeal. The trial court's failure to comment about defendant's probation means defendant was not supposed to receive credit for that time.</SPAN></P>

A jury found defendants guilty of armed robbery, home invasion, and aggravated battery, and they challenged their convictions and sentences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with perjury on the basis that his testimony in two different criminal trials was contradictory. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information for failure to state an offense. The trial court granted the motion finding that the information failed to allege defendant's mental state, which was an essential element of the offense. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that because defendant challenged the sufficiency of the information before the trial court, the more stringent standard of review applied, and the information had to comply with the requirements of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 111-3(a)(3) (1985) to withstand the attack. The court further held that defendant's mental state was an essential element of the offense regardless of whether defendant was charged under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 32-2(a) (1985) or &sect; 32-2(b). Therefore, because the information failed to allege defendant's knowledge of the falsity of the perjured statements at the time he uttered them, it was fatally defective and was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother sued a driver for injuries to her daughter, which were the result of a collision between an automobile driven by the driver and a bicycle ridden by the mother with her daughter as a passenger. The driver later counterclaimed against the mother for contribution for bodily injuries sustained by the daughter. The parents asked the insurer to defend the counterclaim pursuant to their homeowner's policy, whereupon the insurance company filed the underlying declaratory judgment action. On appeal, the parents argued that a third-party claim for contribution was not a bodily injury to an insured and, further, that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 73, para. 755.01 (1985) and public policy prohibited enforcement of the household exclusion clause. Upon review, the court found the parents' arguments without merit. It was clear that the household exclusion clause in the parents' policy unambiguously excluded any liability for a counterclaim seeking contribution from them for bodily injuries to a family member. Such a counterclaim was an intangible loss not covered by the property damage provisions of the policy.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that he was insane at the time of the offense. The jury was instructed, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 3-2 (1985), that defendant had the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was not guilty by reason of insanity. The sole issue on appeal was whether &sect; 3-2 violated defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that &sect; 3-2 did not offend the due process clause of the United States Constitution, which stated that no one could be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The court found that the insanity defense did not negate mens rea and thus the legislature could properly classify it as an affirmative defense rather than an element of an offense. Section 3-2, which required defendant to prove his insanity by a preponderance of the evidence, did not violate the constitution of Illinois either. The Illinois courts and the Illinois legislature had distinguished between mens rea and sanity. Because a defendant could intend to commit an offense and yet be subject to a mental disease which rendered him or her incapable of appreciating the nature of or controlling his or her actions, sanity was not an element of a crime, such as murder. Moreover, although prior to the statute Illinois had always placed the burden of proof of sanity on the State, that was not enough by itself to render the statute unconstitutional. Therefore, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bookstore was enjoined from distributing obscene material. It challenged the constitutionality of the injunction, and while that matter was pending was cited for contempt because it sold two pornographic magazines. A jury found the bookstore had violated the injunction and was in contempt. The trial court assessed a fine of $ 10,000. The bookstore filed an appeal, noting that the underlying injunction was found to be unconstitutional. It challenged the testimony of an expert witness and the imposition of the fine. The court affirmed the jury verdict and the fine. It held that in general a contempt charge could not be sustained if the underlying order engaged in prior restraint of pure speech. It held that paragraph one of the injunction enjoined the sale of obscene material as determined under the criminal code. It held that the finding of contempt could stand because paragraph one was still valid. It held that the expert's testimony about the relationship between the magazines and AIDS was not relevant, but its admission was not harmful error.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendants were convicted of armed robbery on a theory of accountability. Defendants appealed, and the court reversed the convictions. The trial court committed reversible error when it failed to question prospective jurors in accordance with a recent holding. Contrary to the state's position, the filing of a petition for rehearing did not alter the effective date of that holding. The trial court was required during its voir dire examination to have probed the venire's attitudes concerning (1) returning a guilty verdict if the state did not sustain its burden of proof; (2) the presumption of innocence; (3) the fact that defendants were not required to present any evidence; and (4) the fact that defendants' failure to testify could not be held against them. The subject matter of these questions was neither covered in the course of voir dire, nor set forth in the trial court's general comments to the venire. One defendant was not convicted in violation of the Juvenile Court Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 701-1 et seq. (1983), because the indictment clearly apprised him that he was charged with armed robbery with a firearm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In support of defendant's assertion that the penalty provision for possession of a stolen vehicle was unconstitutional, he argued both that it punished the lesser included offense of possession more severely than the greater offense of theft, and that the penalty provision was not reasonably designed to remedy the evils which the legislature had determined to be a threat to the public. The court agreed with defendant stating that the sentencing scheme violated the constitutional assurances of proportionate penalties and due process since the penalty for theft of a motor vehicle was less than that for possession of a stolen motor vehicle even though additional elements were required to prove the greater offense of theft. The court concluded that although consideration of the problems associated with organized vehicle theft, &quot;chop shops,&quot; and possible remedies were within the legislature's province, the court was compelled to intervene because the legislative scheme, which subjected defendants not engaged in those activities to a harsher penalty than those who were so engaged, was not reasonably designed to remedy the identified evils.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, contending that the refusal to instruct the jury as to the affirmative defense of reasonable belief of age was erroneous and that his counsel was ineffective. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. It held that the victim's testimony on cross-examination that defendant told the victim shortly after her 15th birthday that he thought she was 16 did not put defendant's affirmative defense of reasonable belief of age in issue. Defendant could not raise the defense on cross-examination, and therefore, defendant was not entitled to the defense instruction. The court held that defendant's counsel was not ineffective for deciding not to recall the victim in order to establish the reasonable belief defense because counsel's decision was a matter of trial strategy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent father of a minor appealed pro se a decision from the Circuit Court of DuPage County (Illinois), adjudicating the minor a minor requiring authoritative intervention (MRAI). The lower court also determined that it was in the best interests of the minor to be made a ward of the court, placed her under supervision for a one-year period, and released her to the continued care and custody of her foster parents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the father contended (1) &sect; 2 -- 3 of the Juvenile Court Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 702 -- 3 (1985), (the MRAI statute) was unconstitutional; (2) he was deprived of due process at the dispositional hearing; (3) the adjudication of the minor as an MRAI was against the manifest weight of the evidence; and (4) the MRAI statute did not further the basic purpose of the Juvenile Court Act. The court rejected the father's contention that the statute was unconstitutional. In asserting that he was denied due process at the dispositional hearing, the father argued he did not receive the statutory notice required, he was not afforded a &quot;fair opportunity to controvert&quot; the contents of the social history report, and he was denied his right to have counsel present. He requested the court's dispositional order be set aside. The court concluded that lack of the required notice that the hearing was a dispositional one deprived the father of the opportunity to effectively controvert the report's conclusion and recommended disposition by presenting evidence relevant to the lower court's determination of wardship and proper disposition. This required reversal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment below which found the minor to be an MRAI. The court reversed the lower court's dispositional order, and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that in the absence of evidence demonstrating fraud or an effort to undermine the nominating process, nullification was not warranted. The court determined that joinder of the candidates for an office that was not the subject of the action was unnecessary. The court held that &sect; 7-43(c) was constitutional and it did not prohibit independents from voting in a party primary. The court held that the deceased plaintiff's cause of action abated.

Rev. Stat. ch. 111 2/3, para. 1 et seq., specifically Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 2/3, para. 36 (1979).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission's order resulted from a reconciliation hearing during which the commission reviewed the electric company's costs of fuel and purchased power for 1983. The electric company argued that the commission exceeded its statutory authority in ordering a refund, the finding of the electric company's imprudence was not based on substantial evidence, it was denied due process of law, the commission's award of interest was erroneous, and the trial court abused its discretion in entering the injunction. The court affirmed the commission's order as to the refund and held that the commission was within its statutory authority under &sect; 36 of the Act when it applied the prudence standard to the reasons for the purchases and not only to the actual purchases. However, the court reversed the finding that the electric company was liable for interest and held that the commission had no statutory authority to impose either pre- or post-order interest on the refund under &sect;&sect; 36 or 72 of the Act, specifically Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 2/3, paras. 36, 76 (1979). The court affirmed the trial court's mandatory injunction, directing the commission to pay the refund, except for the interest.</SPAN></P>

However, his application for a certificate was denied. The accountant moved to Illinois and applied to the Committee for an Illinois CPA certificate. He requested the Committee to accept the transfer of his New York examination credit. The Committee interpreted Committee Rule 16(d), 5 Ill. Reg. 8310 (1981), to require a person applying for a transfer of out-of-state credits to initially sit for all four sections of the examination at the same time. Because the accountant sat for only three sections when he first attempted the examination in New York, the Committee denied his application. The accountant filed an action for declaratory judgment and the trial court granted the Committee's motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed and held that the Committee correctly interpreted Rule 16 to mean that an applicant who wished to transfer examination credit from another state must have taken all four portions in one sitting, which was the same standard that was required of Illinois residents.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner brought an action against the contractor for damages to the landowner's building resulting from negligent services provided by the contractor in the engineering and construction of an underground sewer system adjacent to the insurer's property. The trial court found that the complaint, filed almost five years after the damage occurred, was barred by a two-year statute of limitations set forth in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 13-214(a) (1983). On appeal, the landowner contended that its cause of action was governed by the five-year statute of limitations for recovery for an injury to property set forth in Ill. Rev.

There was nothing in Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagee filed a foreclosure action and a deputy sheriff personally served the mortgagor wife with two copies of the summons and complaint. The return of service reflected that substituted service was made on the mortgagor husband by leaving the summons and complaint with the mortgagor wife. Default judgment was entered against the mortgagors, and the property was sold to the purchasers at a sheriff's sale. The purchasers went to the property to advise the mortgagors that they had obtained a writ of assistance against them. That day, the mortgagor wife died of a self inflicted gunshot wound. The mortgagor husband claimed that he never received notice of the foreclosure and filed a motion to vacate the default judgment. The trial court granted the motion and quashed the summons. The purchasers appealed. The court reversed the trial court's order and denied the motion. The return of service was not facially defective, and the substituted service pursuant to Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, widow of the deceased, appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that granted the motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action filed by defendants, the alcohol provider, a bank, and others, in plaintiff's complaint for loss of support for fatal injuries suffered by husband following his consumption of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of the Liquor Control Act of 1934, as amended, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 43, para. 135(1985), claiming that it was an arbitrary classification that barred causes of action for loss of support by the relatives of intoxicated persons against the dramshop. The court reasoned that in the absence of a fundamental right or suspect classification, the legislature may differentiate between persons similarly situated if there was a reasonable basis for doing to. A court should not interfere with the legislature's judgment unless the classification was clearly unreasonable and palpably arbitrary. The court held that the challenged amendment was rationally related to the legitimate legislative purpose of increasing recovery for one class and denying it for another. Persons who claimed to be supported by the intoxicated person had a derivative claim. Since there was no common law cause of action against dramshops, the legislature had always denied recovery for the intoxicated person, and it was not arbitrary for the legislature to likewise withdraw recovery for those claiming through them. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was detained, he gave an incriminating statement. In reversing his conviction, the court found that the test to be applied was whether a reasonable innocent man would have concluded that he was not free to leave when confronted with the circumstances facing defendant. The test was not a subjective one, and therefore it was irrelevant whether defendant believed he was under arrest or whether the police intended to detain defendant against his will unless that intent was conveyed to the defendant. Officers had no probable cause to arrest defendant when he was stopped, and the stop of defendant in his car clearly was a seizure for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. The seizure of defendant was investigatory in nature, calculated to elicit information from him, and there were no intervening circumstances between this detention and defendant's initial confession to break the causal connection between those events. The trial court erred in failing to quash defendant's arrest and to suppress the statements he made during his interrogation. Based on that finding the convictions had to be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the district was entitled to conduct a profitable operation of its harbors and since mooring fees were the main source of revenue from the harbors, it could have only been accomplished through profits derived from mooring fees. The court further held that the practice of charging higher mooring fees to nonresidents of the city was constitutional because fees charged nonresidents of such district need not be the same as fees charged to resident of the district under Ill.

Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 120, para. 439.3 and ch. 24, para. 8-11-6, on three jet aircraft owned by the company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company operated in all states but was headquartered in Illinois. It owned three airplanes which were used for business purposes. The airplanes were purchased outside Illinois but were later hangered and maintained there. They were titled in Delaware, and no use, sale, or occupation tax of any kind had been paid at the time of purchase. The department conducted a tax audit and assessed tax, interest, and penalties due under the Illinois and municipal use taxes. The company filed an appeal, but a final assessment was made. The company appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the department's decision. Upon further appeal, the court concluded that under an economic analysis, the company's airplanes were subject to taxation as there was a substantial nexus with Illinois and there was no discrimination against interstate commerce. The company received all the benefits of the protection of Illinois laws, access to its legal system, and innumerable other services. Thus, taxes should have been assessed. However, because the airplanes were titled in Delaware, the municipal use tax was improperly imposed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, finding that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-10.1 (1985), which allowed the admission of his codefendant's prior inconsistent statements as substantive evidence, did not violate the separation of powers doctrine by encroaching upon an exclusive judicial function because the legislature was entitled to promulgate new or alter existing rules of evidence. Section 115-10.1 was not void where it complemented Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 238, which did not control the use of such statements as substantive evidence, but stated the rule with regard to their use for impeachment purposes. The trial court's decision to admit the codefendant's prior inconsistent statement as substantive evidence against defendant did not violate the Confrontation Clause because it allowed for full cross-examination, and the credibility of the signed statement was properly reserved for the trial court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant previously pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment.

Defendant argued that the increased sentence violated his due process rights. On appeal, the court affirmed the 12-year sentence. The court noted that, at the sentencing hearing, no evidence was presented in aggravation or mitigation. The court declined to follow People v. Pierce, 80 Ill. App. 3d 514, 400 N.E.2d 62 (1980). The court found that that the State pointed out a number of instances that came to light at trial and appeared in the record to support the increased sentence. The court also found that the trial court did not state its reasons for the increased sentence. The court reasoned that because defendant's second trial and later conviction were the result of his own decision to withdraw his guilty plea in the original proceeding, he could not claim the protection intended for those who attack their convictions on constitutional grounds by either direct review or collateral attack.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that defendant was not denied his equal protection or due process rights by the lower court's decision to not award defendant an attorney. The court found that there was a rational basis for treating defendants who filed a direct appeal differently than those who filed appeals for post-conviction relief. The court concluded that the lower court did not err in denying defendant a copy of his trial transcript. The court held that the lower court committed reversible error in failing to enter its order of dismissal within thirty days of the filing of the petition because the applicable statute was mandatory and not discretionary. The court found that the dismissal was void and remanded the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state brought administrative proceedings against the chiropractor. The chiropractor allegedly forged the name of a doctor to obtain payment for services. The hearing officer denied the chiropractor's request for a subpoena to obtain the deposition of the doctor, whom the chiropractor claimed was the sole material witness. The chiropractor sought the injunction until the subpoena issued. The court held that the chiropractor had no due process right to a prehearing discovery deposition. Pursuant to Ill. Admin. Code tit. 68, &sect; 110.130(h)(1985), the only depositions allowed in administrative hearings were evidence depositions agreed to by the parties for use at trial. The chiropractor had an adequate remedy at law. Denial of the deposition did not threaten to hamper the chiropractor's defense. The chiropractor was provided a list of all the state's witnesses and copies of all documents. The court noted that exhaustion of administrative remedies was a prerequisite to judicial review. Upon judicial review, the chiropractor could have alleged that the state had information that would have been helpful to him.</SPAN></P>

As to defendant's challenge to the jury instructions, the court held that the instructions as given were not so inaccurate and misleading as to deny defendant a fair jury determination of his defense.

A customer noted the license plate number of the car defendant drove away in after the robbery. Police arrested defendant finding the knife and a bag with two holes in the car used in the robbery. The trial court admitted a police officer's testimony that defendant was given Miranda warnings and did not allow defendant to elicit testimony as to his own post arrest statements. The trial court refused to instruct the jury on robbery as a lesser-included offense. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that admission of the officer's testimony was not subject to the plain error doctrine since there was overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. Defendant was not entitled to elicit testimony of his post arrest statements, since they would have been hearsay statements of his alibi. Since the utility knife could cause serious injury however it was used, the court held that defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on robbery.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed with prejudice the count against the hospital and against two of the doctors, finding that the administrator's written reports were defective for failure to comply with Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-622(b) (1985), which required a certificate and written report as to each defendant. The court found that the counts against the two doctors were properly dismissed because the administrator's reports did not mention them or their involvement in the case, and the reports did not indicate that there was a reasonable and meritorious cause for filing an action against them. The court affirmed the dismissal against the hospital for failure to state a cause of action because the administrator failed to allege a cognizable theory of liability and the allegations were conclusory and unsupported. The court found that the dismissals under &sect; 2-622 did not have to be dismissed with prejudice, and the trial court had the discretion to allow the administrator to file an amended complaint, affidavit, or written report. Accordingly, the court vacated and remanded the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a dispute, the former minister was ousted from the church. Notwithstanding her ouster, the former minister still attempted to perform her previous duties at the church, and on a couple of occasions she refused to leave the church premises when requested to do so by the church's pastor. The church filed a petition for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, and the lower court granted the church a permanent injunction even though the church had not requested permanent relief. The lower court permanently enjoined the former minister from interfering with religious services, conducting meetings, and from contesting the right of the pastor to designate the method of religious service. The court reversed the lower court, holding that although there was adequate evidence to support a preliminary injunction, the former minister's due process rights were violated when the lower court issued a permanent injunction on its own initiative. The court ruled that the lower court on remand was required to particularize the restrictions it placed on the former minister so that her First Amendment rights were not violated by overly broad and vague restrictions.</SPAN></P>

The officer also testified that the stolen car had no tires and that he saw four tires in the backseat of defendant's car. The officer further stated that defendant confessed that he stole the car because he needed new tires for his car. The state, however, was unable to produce the tires at trial so that the owner of the stolen car could identify them. Defendant was convicted of burglary and possession of a stolen motor vehicle. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Although defendant denied stating that he had stolen the car and testified that he had purchased the tires found in the back of his car, the court held that the testimony of the police officer, which was believed by the trial court to be credible, was sufficient to support a finding that defendant was guilty of the crimes with which he was charged. The court also rejected defendant's claim that &sect; 4-103, which was a lesser included offense of theft, was unconstitutional solely because it could possibly result in a longer sentence than the crime of theft.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of armed violence and attempted armed robbery, he was sentenced to a term of seven years' imprisonment for the armed violence only. Defendant sought review, contending that the armed violence statute was unconstitutionally applied. Defendant also alleged that there was prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments and that the trial judge erred in refusing to answer the deliberating jurors' questions. The court found that, although the two offenses were initially classified identically, when the gun was introduced, intimidation was elevated to a more serious crime than attempted armed robbery. The court ruled that this resulted in an unconstitutionally disproportionate sentencing scheme. The court examined the prosecutor's remarks and held that they did not diminish the presumption of innocence and the reasonable doubt standard. The court held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by submitting the answer that he did because the instructions to the jury were sufficient.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that defense counsel prevented him from testifying, and he alleged prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel.

Thus, he met his burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. There was no evidence to indicate that the uncorrected vision requirement was the minimum degree of vision acuity necessary to perform the job. It was simply an arbitrary requirement. The board failed to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its vision standard. Thus, the standard violated public policy. The court found that the commission properly awarded the applicant the position he applied for, rather than a position without probationary status that he requested.

Mun. Code ch. 104, &sect; 104 -- 1 (1984-85). The provider cross-appealed the court's denial of attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The service provider installed and operated systems designed to provide television programming to subscribers in high-rise apartment buildings from a single satellite or microwave receiver. The city amended its amusement tax ordinance to cover cable and subscription television but provided an exception for any entity with whom the city had entered into a franchise agreement. The service provider brought suit seeking to have the amendment declared invalid and also seeking attorney fees. The trial court ruled in favor of the provider but denied its claim for attorney fees. On appeal, the court affirmed the declaration that the amendment was invalid but reversed the denial of attorney fees. The court held that, under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, there were no special circumstances justifying a denial of fees. With respect to the amendment, the court found that no compelling governmental interest justified the tax exempt status granted to franchised cable television. The court held that the distinction the city tried to make between franchised cable television and subscription television was the kind of arbitrary legislative choice the equal protection clause forbids.</SPAN></P>

The bartender's two oral motions to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of vagueness and unconstitutionality of the subject ordinance were denied. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the only power of the municipality to regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages was that conferred upon it by the State under the Liquor Control Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 43, para. 115(d) (1985).

Her mother was allowed to testify to the process of investigation and statements the child made at the time. Defendant was convicted and sentenced. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The hearsay testimony of the child's pretrial statements was admissible under the exception provided in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-10 (1985). The child was competent and was available for cross-examination. Defendant did not show that claimed errors by his trial counsel resulted in substantial prejudice to him. Defendant's sentence was within statutory requirements, and there was no equal protection violation in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3(c)(2)(H), which allowed probation only if the criminal sexual assault defendant was a family member of the victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a search, the police found five bags of cocaine in different locations in defendant's apartment. Defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver and received a large fine. The court affirmed defendant's conviction but remanded the case for a hearing to determine the &quot;street value&quot; of the actual drug seized for imposition of a proper fine. The court instructed the trial court to determine whether it intended to sentence defendant solely under &sect; 5--9--1.1 of the Unified Code of Corrections (Code), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005 -- 9 -- 1.1 (1985), which established a fine based on &quot;street value&quot; of drugs, or in conjunction with &sect; 5-- 9--1 of the Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005--9--1 (1983). An officer's opinion, standing alone, was insufficient to establish the street value of the drugs in the absence of some evidence establishing the purity of the substance. The trial court did not err by seizing a bond posted by defendant's family members in order to satisfy the fine. Defendant had the requisite control over the apartment from which the trial court could have inferred knowledge and possession of the drugs.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there were no final orders of the board subject to administrative review under &sect; 9 of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act, Ill. Rev.

Further, the court found that a unit-representation decision of the board was not directly reviewable in the courts by a writ of certiorari.

The court held that the creation of a new class of licenses with concomitant restrictions was a legitimate method by which to attack the great disturbance alleged to have been caused by individuals as they were leaving establishments like the juice bar owner's. Accordingly, there was the requisite relationship between the ordinance and the city council's legitimate objectives. Community approval was a proper requirement mandated by the ordinance because the public interest was affected. The municipality had the authority to alter the benefits and responsibilities that the juice bar owner, as a license holder, received from his license.</SPAN></P>

The landlord challenged the trial court's interpretation of &sect; 8 of the Mobile Home Landlord and Tenant Rights Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 80, para. 208 (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord notified the tenant that his lease would not be renewed at the end of the term because his yard was not maintained and the disposal of garbage created a health hazard.

The trial court found that the Act required proof of cause for nonrenewal, that the Act was constitutional, that the landlord was not entitled to a judgment of eviction, and that the tenant failed to provide sufficient evidence to support relief on his counterclaim. The court affirmed, holding that: 1) the trial court properly found that proof of cause was required by &sect; 8 of the Act; 2) the Act did not violate due process, equal protection, the special legislation provision of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 (1970), or the right to contract; 3) it was not against the manifest weight of the evidence for the trial court to determine that the landlord failed to prove cause for nonrenewal; and 4) the evidence supported the trial court's finding that the tenant did not offer sufficient proof to prevail on his counterclaim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that, because the police officer that arrested him did not have probable cause to believe he had committed a crime, the evidence seized during a search of his vehicle after his arrest should have been suppressed. Defendant also argued that the victim's show-up identification testimony should have been suppressed. The court affirmed the conviction. The court found that the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant based on an accurate, detailed description of the suspect, defendant's nearness in time and place to the scene of the crime, the fact that defendant did not live in the neighborhood, and defendant's attempted flight when the officer approached him. The court similarly found that the search incident to the lawful arrest was based on probable cause reasoning that the crime defendant was suspected of committing involved a weapon and defendant bent down as if to reach beneath the seat of the vehicle when the officer approached.

The villages, both of which were within 1 1/2 miles of the proposed incorporation area, one of whom annexed part of the territory during the pendency of the action, claimed that their consent was a precondition to approval.

The Board also created a new working cash fund and authorized the issuance of working cash fund bonds. Additional taxes were levied against the district's taxpayers as a result of the bond issue and the objectors challenged the levy of new taxes. The objectors, contrary to their original position, argued that the school district could have increased the working fund by issuing bonds, but it could not abolish and re-create the fund to achieve the same result. The district claims that its procedure was not prejudicial to the objectors because it did not result in issuance of bonds in excess of the amount statutorily allowed. The court found that the procedure followed by the district, permissible under the School Code, did not permit it to circumvent the statutory tax limits or levy an illegal tax against the objectors, thus, it was not improper.</SPAN></P>

The doctors then filed their motion to dismiss under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 103(b), 107 Ill. 2d 103(b), for the patient's failure to exercise reasonable diligence in serving the original complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not err in considering the patient's diligence in obtaining service of the original complaint and that the doctors did not waive their rights under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 103(b), 107 Ill. 2d 103(b), by filing motions and participating in the lawsuit. The court held given that the doctors' business addresses were listed in the telephone book and that there were no special circumstance preventing the patient from serving them, the patient failed to exercise reasonable diligence in serving the doctors after the expiration of the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants Illinois Department of Registration and Education (department) sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which reversed an order of the department revoking the licenses of appellees, pharmacy and pharmacists, and held that the &quot;good faith&quot; provision of Illinois Controlled Substances Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 56 1/2, para. 1102(v), was unconstitutionally vague and uncertain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pharmacy was licensed by the department to dispense controlled substances. The department filed an action against the pharmacy and two pharmacists, seeking revocation or suspension of licenses. After a hearing before the state board of pharmacy, the department revoked the licenses, asserting that the pharmacy and pharmacists lacked good faith in dispensing schedule II controlled substances, in violation of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act (act), Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 56 1/2, para. 1102(v). The circuit court reversed the decision. On review, the court reversed judgment of the circuit court and held that the &quot;good faith&quot; provision of the act, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 56 1/2, para. 1102(v), was not unconstitutionally vague and uncertain. The court held that the &quot;good faith&quot; provision of the act contained six specific guidelines to place pharmacists on notice of prohibited practices. Further, the department could utilize its experience and knowledge in determining whether there was substantial evidence to support a finding of lack of good faith, and a reviewing court would not interfere with an agency's decision to impose sanctions absent an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 42, para. 4-36, 4-37 (1985). The treasurer cross-appealed the denial of its motion for judgment on the pleadings and the findings that his method of computing costs was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the legislature amended the Illinois Drainage Code (Code) to require reimbursement by districts to the county treasurer for his services as ex officio treasurer and collector, the district refused to pay its treasurer, and the treasurer filed an action for reimbursement. The trial court granted judgment to the treasurer, but found that his method of accounting was erroneous. Both parties cross-appealed. The court affirmed, holding that &sect;&sect; 4-36, 4-37 did not violate Ill. Const. of 1970 art. VII, &sect; 9(a) because the constitutional provision did not limit or restrict the counties and local taxing districts from contracting among themselves. The statutes were not unconstitutionally vague because their terms were not so ill defined that their meaning would be determined on the opinions and whims of the trier of fact. The statutes did not violate the equal protection clauses of the Illinois and United States Constitutions and they were not special or local laws because they did not contain unreasonable or arbitrary classifications and they operated alike upon all persons in like situations.

The court also ruled that the guilty but mentally ill statute was not unconstitutional and that the burden imposed upon defendant by Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-10.1, which allowed substantive use of prior inconsistent statements in criminal trials, was an unconstitutional legislative infringement on judicial power because it changed a rule of evidence developed by prior case law and that the aggravated arson statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para 20-1.1, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case, finding that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-10.1 did not unduly infringe on judicial power and was, therefore, a proper exercise of legislative authority. The court noted that the aggravated arson statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para 20-1.1, was unconstitutional because it did not require an unlawful purpose in setting a fire. The court further concluded that because the aggravated arson charges filed against defendant did not require proof of injury to any person, there was no multiple-victim basis for allowing defendant's single act to support a conviction for arson as well as murder.</SPAN></P>

Additional taxes were levied against the district's taxpayers as a result of the bond issue and the objectors challenged the levy of new taxes. The trial court denied their objections to taxes levied by the county tax collector on behalf of a school district. The court stated that the most important criterion in the area of procedural due process was &quot;reasonableness.&quot; The State had to act reasonably before depriving a person of a liberty or property interest. The court found that the situation involved a statutory equalization procedure in apportioning the burden of taxation for counties within an overlapping taxing district and a provision to implement that procedure when there was not a timely valuation or rate certification. The failure to provide prior notice of the extension of a deficiency tax levy or tax credit to an individual taxpayer did not present a denial of due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was defendant's first for possession of a stolen motor vehicle and there was no evidence that defendant was involved in organized vehicle theft as a profession. The court determined that it was in the interests of justice to consider the constitutionality of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95, para. 4-103(b) despite defendant's failure to preserve the issue below. The legislative scheme of increasing the penalty imposed on all defendants convicted for the first time of possession of a stolen motor vehicle was not reasonably designed to attack the evils of organized vehicle theft and chop shops. Paragraph 4-103(b) imposed a greater penalty on all such defendants than it did on those convicted of theft of a motor vehicle under the general theft statute. The amendment to para. 4-103(b) was unconstitutional because it violated the due process clause of the Illinois Constitution.

The prosecution argued that the term midwifery had a common and popularly understood meaning, that of assisting in childbirth. The court held that: (1) in the context of a criminal prosecution, the offense was not defined with sufficient definiteness that a person of ordinary intelligence could understand what conduct was prohibited in a manner that would prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement; (2) while many other types of professions and activities were defined by the legislature, the term midwifery had not been defined; (3) the lack of a scienter requirement lent vagueness to the Act; (4) due process was offended because the Act was so incomplete, vague, indefinite, and uncertain that people of ordinary intelligence had to guess at its meaning and could differ as to its application; and (5) the provisions of the Act making it a crime to practice midwifery without a license were unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court's denial of the defendant's motion to quash and suppress was not against the weight of the evidence because police officers had the minimum articulable suspicion required to stop the defendant, that there was no denial of due process in either the prosecutor's statements or the instructions given to the jury by the trial court, and that para. 24-1.1 was constitutional.

She contended that the statute violated her rights to equal protection and due process and authorized a health professional to exercise a judicial function. On appeal, the court ruled that the statute was constitutional because it met the rational-basis test and therefore did not infringe the patient's rights to equal protection and due process. The court also concluded that the statute did not require the health professional to exercise a judicial function because the affidavit was required to contain only statements of fact, not conclusions of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board members contended that by finding the ordinances unconstitutional, the constitutional mandate of separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches of the county government was violated. They also maintained that Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6, empowered the county board, under its home rule powers, to pass the ordinances despite the conflicting statute empowering the county president to appoint members of the commissioners' staffs. The court disagreed and affirmed the circuit court. The board members attempted to take power given by statute to the chief executive officer and improperly transfer it to the legislative body of the government. Absent submission for approval by referendum, enactment of these ordinances was improper. The court's finding regarding an improper attempt to alter the form of government applied with equal force to all positions enumerated in the employee resolution and was not based on the confidential status or duties of the employees. The fact that the action constituted a change in the form of government, requiring referendum approval, also limited the home rule powers invoked by the board members.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the EPA had certified the city's landfill closed and covered, it issued a &sect; 4(q) notice under the act to the city. The notice informed the city that there was an actual or threatened release of a hazardous substance from the site, which presented an imminent and substantial endangerment to public safety. The notice outlined the specific steps the city had to take to comply with the act. It also informed the city that there was potential liability for punitive damages if the city did not comply &quot;without sufficient cause&quot; pursuant to &sect; 22.2 of the act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 1022.2 (1985). The city challenged the constitutionality of the notice provision. Upon review, the court found that the notice provision of the act was constitutional because the protection of the public health and safety was a paramount governmental interest that justified the summary administrative action. The court determined that the lack of a pre-enforcement hearing did not offend due process principles because the act gave the city the opportunity to assert a good-faith defense to the validity of the order prior to the imposition of a penalty. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

At the hearing on the matter, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the suspension. Defendant later pleaded guilty to driving under the influence and he was sentenced. By agreement, defendant's motion to dismiss was continued pending the outcome of a case before the Supreme Court of Illinois that had identical issues. The lower court entered the order at issue which stayed defendant's suspension pending the outcome in the supreme court case, and which reinstated his driving privileges. The secretary argued that the lower court lacked the power to order the stay. The court reversed the order and remanded the case. The stay order exceeded the lower court's discretion under the implied consent statute, para. 2-118.1(b).</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-16(b) (1985), by the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois). Defendant claimed that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence of his prior sexual acts with the victims and that the statute violated his equal protection rights when compared with Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para 12-15(a) (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of sexually abusing the victims, his adopted daughters. The trial court admitted the victims' testimony as to defendant's prior sexual misconduct with them after defendant had questioned the victims as to their failure to report the earlier conduct. The court instructed the jury that the testimony was admitted to explain the victims' previous silence and not as evidence of the crimes charged. Defendant claimed that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para 12-16(b) (1985) denied him equal protection of laws because it punished non-violent sexual acts more severely than sexual abuse by force, more egregious conduct criminalized by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-15(a) (1985). On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the victims' testimony about defendant's prior sexual misconduct with them was properly admitted to explain their earlier silence, given the limiting instruction and the fact that defendant had raised the issue. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para 12-16(b) (1985) did not violate the equal protection clause since it was reasonable for the legislature to have found that sexual misconduct with a family member was more egregious than that by force.</SPAN></P>

The court held, inter alia, that: (1) complainant's testimony that she had been raped was sufficient to prove penetration; (2) the acquittal of one defendant on the deviate sexual assault charge did not cast doubt on his conviction for rape, as deviate sexual assault required completely different acts; (3) there was no Brady violation, because the state tendered everything it had in its possession; (4) the acquittal of one defendant on the deviate sexual assault charge did not raise any doubt as to other defendant's guilt, as each was tried separately with somewhat different evidence; (5) the complainant's testimony sufficiently proved venue; (6) the search of the car in which the crimes occurred was reasonable under the circumstances; and (6) the Habitual Criminal Statute, Ill.

He alleged that the mother gave birth to the daughter, and that he was the father. He had enjoyed visitation since the daughter's birth, but during the period of time shortly before he filed his petition, the mother allowed him visitation only infrequently. The mother brought a motion to dismiss on grounds that it was barred by the statute of limitations for paternity actions provided in the Illinois Parentage Act of 1984, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 2508 (1985). The father sought to add the daughter as a party respondent. The trial court decided to hear the motion to dismiss first. The father argued that the limitations period was inapplicable because he did not petition to establish paternity, but the trial court dismissed the petition. The father appealed. The court affirmed because the court had an obligation to appoint a guardian ad litem for the daughter before deciding any issue which might have affected her. However, the court remanded for the appointment of a guardian ad litem, who could assist in determining the father and daughter relationship.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 482 et seq., was entitled to tax deeds after it struck their redemptions under protest, and that found the Act constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the tax deeds issued to the county. The court held that the penalty provisions of &sect; 253 of the Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 734 (1983), did not contravene due process or any usury laws. The court determined that use of permanent real estate index numbers in advertisements and notices of sale were proper legal descriptions of the properties pursuant to &sect;&sect; 228, 30, and 1 of the Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 709, 511, and 482(19) (1983). The county satisfied the requirement of &sect; 239 of the Act, Ill. Rev.

The mortgagor appealed and contended that the trial court erred when it failed to dismiss the mortgagee's complain because the mortgage was not prepared by an attorney and that the fee collected by the sheriff for selling the property was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the mortgagee was not practicing law when it prepared the mortgages. The mortgagee prepared the mortgages for its purposes, did not provide legal advice to the mortgagor, and did not prohibit the mortgagor from retaining an attorney.

The trial court denied his motions for a new trial, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and in arrest of judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the hearing on defendant's pretrial petition to rescind the statutory summary suspension of his driver's license, the officer who administered the breathalyzer did not testify, and the State failed to establish that the defendant was observed continuously for 20 minutes before the test was given. Based on the lack of foundation, the trial court refused to admit the test results, and rescinded the summary suspension. Defendant argued that the trial court's ruling at the suspension hearing collaterally estopped the State from introducing the results at trial. The court found that collateral estoppel did not apply because the question of whether the State laid a proper foundation at the suspension hearing was a question of law, and collateral estoppel applied only to issues of fact. Additionally, the trial court's ruling on the foundation objection was not a final judgment on the merits of an ultimate issue. The court also found that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had at least a .10 concentration of alcohol in his breath at the time of his driving.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that he was denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel, and that the statute that made it unlawful for a felon to possess a firearm was unconstitutional because it bore no reasonable relationship to the interest the state sought to protect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record showed that trial counsel employed the usual stratagems of cross-examination and direct defense testimony to counter the weapons charge as well as the armed robbery charge for which defendant received an acquittal. Defendant's cross-examination testimony left no doubt that he did have a weapon in his possession when he was arrested. The court held that trial counsel's remark in opening argument was consistent with defendant's testimony, not contrary to it. The court held that defendant received the effective assistance of counsel. Defendant also contended that the statute that made it unlawful for a felon to possess a firearm was unconstitutional because the language of the statute swept too broadly by its inclusion of all individuals who had ever been convicted of a felony and proscribed the possession of items, many of which were not evil in themselves without requiring a culpable mental state, in violation of the due process provisions of the Illinois and U.S. Constitutions.

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 716a (1983). The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted defendant county clerk's motion to dismiss, finding that the taxpayer had an adequate remedy at law and that the amendment was constitutional. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged amendment to the Act provided that except for single family residential units being owner-occupied condominium units, cooperative units, or dwellings, the amount required to be paid for redemption shall include an amount equal to all delinquent taxes on such property which taxes were delinquent at the time of sale. To protect its security interest in real estate sold at a scavenger sale, the taxpayer sought redemption under the Act. The county clerk rejected the taxpayer's tender for redemption because it did not include an amount equal to all the delinquent taxes due as of the time of sale as required by the Act. The taxpayer sought mandamus and declaratory relief. The trial court dismissed the taxpayer's action. The taxpayer sought review. The court held that, because the Act provided an adequate remedy at law to adjudicate the sufficiency of the redemption by paying the required amount under protest, the taxpayer was not entitled to equitable relief where there was no showing that the tax was unauthorized by law, that the property was exempt from taxation, or that the tax was fraudulent. As such, it was unnecessary to reach the constitutional question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portion of the trial court's judgment that found declaratory relief was improper because there was an adequate remedy at law.

More than two years after the accident, appellee filed a wrongful death counterclaim against appellant in the wrongful death action previously filed by appellant against appellee. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss on grounds that the counterclaim was untimely. On appeal of the trial court's denial of the motion, the court reversed and held that the counterclaim should have been dismissed as untimely filed. The court determined that the trial court erred in failing to follow the rule that a counterclaim for wrongful death based upon the same facts as the original claim required dismissal as untimely filed if not filed within the two-year time period set forth in the Wrongful Death Act. The court further determined that the rule denying wrongful death victims the right to file counterclaims when personal injury victims were allowed to pursue otherwise time-barred claims under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 13-207 (1985) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed defendants' convictions of obscenity, but vacated one defendant's sentence and remanded his case for resentencing. The court held that no rational juror, if properly instructed, could have found value in the magazines in question because the obscenity of the magazines is obvious from the materials themselves, and, therefore, the trial court's improper jury instruction constituted harmless error. The court noted that defendants' guilt of the offense of selling obscene materials was &quot;blatantly evident&quot; from the materials themselves. The court rejected defendants' contention that the error in the instruction could not have been harmless unless the court reconstrued the Illinois obscenity statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-20 (1983), as constitutional. The court concluded that analysis of the statute was not necessary because the United States Supreme Court did not find the statute to be unconstitutional and the statute did not require the social value of allegedly obscene material to be adjudged on community standards. The court also concluded that although one defendant may have failed to preserve the error, interests of justice required review.</SPAN></P>

The tax was imposed pursuant to the Liquor Control Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 43, para. 94 et seq. (1985) (the Act).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Act, manufacturers of wine coolers that contained less than 14 percent alcohol had to pay a $ .23-per-gallon tax, while manufacturers of spirits paid a $ 2-per-gallon tax. The manufacturer sold a spirit-based, fruit-flavored drink similar to a wine cooler. Although the product contained less than 14 percent alcohol, the Department determined that, because the alcohol in the product was obtained from distillation rather than fermentation, the Act required Federated to pay the $ 2-per-gallon tax. The manufacturer contended that, even though the alcohol was produced by distillation, the total alcoholic percentage in the product was less than 14 percent and the product was a type of wine cooler. The court held that it was the alcohol, not the process from which it was derived, that the Act was meant to regulate. Since the ingredients in the product were nearly identical to that of wine coolers, and since the percentage of alcohol in both was precisely the same, there existed no substantial difference between the two types of beverages. To be consistent with the overall theme of the Act, the product was taxed at the lowest rate, as it posed the least danger of abuse.</SPAN></P>

The media company filed a declaratory judgment complaint challenging the ordinance that prohibited the sign. The trial court initially granted the media company summary judgment on the ground that the ordinance was unconstitutional but, upon reconsideration, entered summary judgment on the ground that HACA preempted the ordinance. The trial court then denied the village's motion for rehearing and modification. On appeal, the court held that it was able to sustain the judgment on any grounds warranted by the record and affirmed on the ground that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court found that the it was not able to say that the village's legislative body would have passed the ordinance in question with an admittedly unconstitutional portion eliminated entirely, and thus it was unable to sever the unconstitutional portion and the entire ordinance was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty after he stipulated to the facts. Defendant contended that there was no rational basis for classifying the pornographic photography of a child as a Class 1 felony while punishing intercourse with a child as a Class A misdemeanor, and therefore, the child pornography statute violated due process of law. After a review of the law, the court held that the classification did not constitute a due process violation because there was a rational basis for it. The legislature fashioned the two statutes in question to remedy entirely separate and distinct conduct. Defendant's second argument was that he was not proved guilty of child pornography beyond a reasonable doubt because the photographs depicted mere nudity rather than lewd exhibition of the genitals, as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-20.1(a)(1)(vii) (1985). Examination of the photographs refuted any suggestion that mere nudity was depicted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on evidence that the dealer rolled back a car's odometer, the Secretary revoked its dealership license for 30 days. The circuit court affirmed the decision. On appeal, the court concluded that while it was error for the Secretary to base its decision on a provision that had not been charged, the error was harmless in view of the ample evidence of violations of other provisions that were charged. A criminal conviction was not required as a predicate for an offense under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 5--501(a)(3) (1983), and the provision was not unconstitutionally vague. The Secretary 's findings of fact clearly supported the conclusion that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 3--112.1 was violated. The auto had 96,000 miles on the odometer when the dealer received it. The previous owners did not put the odometer reading on the title assignment form. The form submitted by the dealer indicated an odometer reading of 42,095 miles. The false statement was obviously intended to defraud a later purchaser. Thus, the dealer made an untruthful odometer statement with intent to defraud, satisfying the elements for a para. 3--112.1 violation.</SPAN></P>

An officer then frisked defendant and, upon finding ammunition in his pocket, searched his vehicle and seized a screwdriver and a flashlight. Defendant was charged with theft and possession of burglary tools. The trial court granted his motion to suppress the seized evidence and, on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the initial stop of defendant for questioning was proper pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 107-14 (1985) of the Illinois Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, which was predicated upon Terry, because the officer reasonably suspected that defendant's conduct may have been indicative of past or prospective criminal activity. The court further held, however, that the frisk was improper pursuant to Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for aggravated criminal sexual assault and aggravated battery, in part on the ground that he was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In support of this argument, defendant asserted that the complainant's testimony was disjointed and inconsistent. Affirming, the court stated that the inconsistencies did not detract from the reasonableness of complainant's story. The majority of the inconsistencies relied on by defendant were minor and collateral. Furthermore, the remaining inconsistencies regarding when a knife was produced by defendant and where and how the complainant was injured involved collateral matters relating to how the incident occurred. They did not call into question the identity of the attacker or whether the complainant was in fact sexually assaulted and hit on the head with a deadly weapon. In this regard, the complainant's statements immediately after the incident and her testimony at trial were consistent. While the inconsistencies that developed at trial affected the complainant's credibility, they did not sufficiently detract from the reasonableness of her testimony to render it unclear and unconvincing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his from the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) wherein he was convicted of two counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault, two counts of aggravated battery, and one count of armed violence and was sentenced to concurrent extended terms of imprisonment of 50 years for each aggravated sexual assault conviction, 10 years for each aggravated battery conviction, and 14 years for the armed violence conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim testified that after she refused defendant's request to have sexual intercourse, he struck her eight or nine times with a pair of numchucks, and that she then consented to intercourse because she feared that he would kill her, and that afterward, when she refused to help him find the numchucks, he kicked her repeatedly in the head. The court rejected defendant's arguments that the criminal sexual assault statutes, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 12-14(a)(1), (a)(2) (1985), were vague and overbroad and that a demonstration of the use of numchucks was irrelevant and prejudicial. The court agreed that defendant's multiple convictions arising from a single act of sexual penetration by use of force could not stand because of the one-act-one-crime rule. The court vacated the convictions and sentences imposed for committing a criminal sexual assault by the display of a dangerous weapon, aggravated battery, and armed violence. Because the court could not determine whether the other convictions influenced the trial judge in imposing sentence for the remaining conviction of aggravated criminal sexual assault, the court found that the sentence should be reconsidered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction for aggravated criminal sexual assault imposed under count III of the indictment, vacated the sentence, and remanded for a new sentencing hearing as to that offense. The court vacated the convictions and sentences imposed for the offenses charged in counts II, IV, V and VI of the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator and mother of the deceased claimed that she was a next of kin of the deceased within the meaning of the Wrongful Death Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 70, para. 2 (1985), even though her son was also survived by a wife and child. Her son had died as a result of injuries sustained. Legal proceedings were instituted and during trial the opposing parties settled the claims. When the administrator filed a motion alleging that she was the next of kin, the wife and children of the deceased filed a motion to strike on the ground that the administrator lacked standing. The opposing parties asserted the same ground for affirmance. The trial court granted the motion to strike. Upon appeal, the court affirmed and stated that recovery under the Act was limited to those beneficiaries clearly described in the statute. The beneficiaries as defined by the Act were the surviving spouse and next of kin. Parents were not the next of kin when a decedent left children. The reason was so that the distribution was based on the actual dependency of the spouse and next of kin. The court held that the trial court properly dismissed the administrator's petition to vacate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus after the Illinois Prisoner Review Board (board) denied him parole. Respondents, warden and chairman of the board, filed a motion to dismiss the petition pursuant to Ill. Code Civ. P. &sect; 2-619, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-619 (1985) for failure to state a claim, which was granted by the Circuit Court of Will County (Illinois). The inmate sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's habeas corpus petition was dismissed. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that a motion to dismiss and an answer were distinct actions, and the filing of a motion to dismiss did not preclude later filing an answer. Nor did, filing an answer did not preclude later filing a motion to dismiss. This was clear from Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-610, 2-619(d) (1985). The mere fact that the motion to dismiss did not deny the allegations of the inmate's complaint did not automatically constitute admission of the allegations in the complaint, thereby entitling him to the relief he requested. Further, the court rejected the inmate's claim that the parole provisions of the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1003-3-5(c)(2) (1985) were unconstitutional because they established a deterrent criterion, while Ill. Const. of 1970, art. I, &sect; 11 mandated a rehabilitative criterion. There was also no showing that the inmate was unconstitutionally disadvantaged by the fact that good conduct credit under &sect; 3-6-3(a)(3) of the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1003-6-3(a), was limited to 90 days by statutory amendment.</SPAN></P>
