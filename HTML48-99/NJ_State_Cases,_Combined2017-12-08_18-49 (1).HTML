</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant political candidates sought review of a decision of a New Jersey trial court, which upheld statutes that added &quot;belief&quot; language to the oath of allegiance in N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41:1-1, and the oath pledging support to the constitution in N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41:1-3. Appellants contended the language exceeded and violated the oath requirements contained in Pa. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Chapters 21 to 25 of the Laws of 1949, N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 41:1-1, 3, added language to the oath of allegiance and oath to uphold the constitution which office holders took prior to assuming office; the required language began with the phrase &quot;I do not believe in.&quot; Appellant political candidates challenged the requirement that they state a belief as a condition of office. The lower court upheld the additional language. On appeal, the court reversed because the first rule of constitutional jurisprudence was that the legislation could not add to or subtract from the qualifications for public office established by the constitution under Pa. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1.1. It held that the challenged phrase was an impermissible test intended to disqualify certain people from public office, and was an impermissible act by the legislature. The court held inviolate the right of citizens to elect anyone they choose to represent them, without legislative concern for their beliefs. Accordingly, the challenged statutes were held to be invalid as they pertained to the governor, senators and members of the general assembly, and candidates for those offices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court and held that legislative additions to the oath of allegiance and oath to uphold the constitution, which added language about elected officials' &quot;belief&quot; were invalid under the state constitution because the legislature had no authority to vary the constitutional qualifications for office and could not test the supposed fitness of state officials by such inquiry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A primary election was held to nominate candidates for local office. Two candidates received the same number of votes. Under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19:13-20, the selection of a candidate was submitted to respondent election officials. At the same time, one of the two candidates received the nomination of a rival party. He consented, pursuant to N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19:23-16, to stand for such election. Appellant candidate filed an action to compel respondent election officials to select him as his party's candidate on the ground that he was the only eligible person. He relied on &sect; 19:13-20, which required that a certificate accompany a statement of selection that the candidate was not affiliated with any other party. Appellant maintained that the other candidate, by accepting the write-in vote of a rival party, could not sign the certificate. The trial court dismissed the complaint and the court affirmed because statutory disqualifications of candidates must be construed strictly, and nothing prohibited the other candidate from withdrawing his acceptance of the rival party nomination. The court had no authority to order respondents to select one candidate over another.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, which dismissed appellant candidate's complaint filed against respondent election officials because the requirement of an election eligibility certificate was not pre-empted in the case of a rival who accepted the nomination from another party where he could withdraw that acceptance and stand for election in his own party and make the required certification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner preferred stockholders sought the dissolution of respondent corporation in February 1946, alleging that the four directors of respondent corporation had been deadlocked since February 1937. The certificate of incorporation provided that petitioners had equal representation on the board of directors with respondent common stockholders. In 1937, the directors representing the preferred stockholders introduced a resolution that the directors purchase the outstanding preferred with accrued dividends. When the directors representing the common stockholders refused, the preferred directors withdrew from the meeting and refused to participate in further meetings. The trial court granted the petition to dissolve respondent corporation, finding that the requirements of N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:13-15 had been met. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the even division of the directors on the resolution was not a deadlock, because two-thirds of all the shareholders failed to consent to the dissolution as required in N.J. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant borough was created under Pub. L. 1948, ch. 72. Pursuant to N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:43-21, defendant petitioned for the appointment of three disinterested commissioners to make an appraisal and apportionment of its property and obligations and plaintiff township. Plaintiff's complaint against defendant alleged defendant had no legal existence because ch. 72 was unconstitutional. It also alleged that defendant had no standing to make application for the appointment of commissioners because the provisions of N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:43-10 et seq., were invalid and unconstitutional for reasons all grounded on the premise that ch. 72 was unconstitutional. The complaint was dismissed, and on appeal, the decision was affirmed. The court held that plaintiff could not question the existence of defendant unless it had the permission of the attorney general to do so. Plaintiff had no standing, right or authority to question the constitutionality of ch. 72. Plaintiff was aware of the proposal to create defendant, and permitted the special elections to take place. Thereafter, plaintiff took no action until a collateral proceeding under &sect; 40:43-21 was instituted by defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant railroads sought review of an order of respondent Division of Tax Appeals. Respondent had sustained excise taxes due from railway operating income that were imposed on appellants under the Railway Tax Law of 1941, N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 54:29A-13 et seq. Defendants contended that respondent improperly interpreted the meaning of railway operating income as defined in N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 54:29A-14. The court affirmed in favor of respondent after it held that it could properly use legislative committee reports to determine the matter. The court held that when a taxpayer's accountant and the tax commissioner disagreed about certain entries in the calculation of net income, the tax commissioner's judgment necessarily prevailed because he had the duty of assessing the tax. The court determined that appellants' method of accounting was not in plain conformity with the uniform standards, thus the tax commissioner's denial of appellants' method of calculating net railway operating income was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendants' indictments. The court held that defendants' motions were not timely filed, and could have dismissed defendants' motions on that basis; however, it decided to address defendants' grand jury issues. In so doing, the court concluded that defendants did not meet their burden of establishing that the jury commissioners intentionally excluded persons from grand jury service because they were daily wage earners or persons of color, or that they otherwise violated constitutional or statutory requirements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant State of New Jersey brought an action to enjoin a strike by defendant union of defendant public utility. The labor dispute was resolved but complainant's request for declaratory judgment remained for the court's determination as to the constitutionality of complainant's actions with respect to the seizure of defendant public utility's plant and the forced arbitration between defendant public utility and members of defendant union.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant State of New Jersey brought a declaratory judgment action under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34:13B-26 based on a labor dispute between defendant public utility and defendant union. Defendant public utility argued that the seizure of its plant deprived it of its property without due process. The court found that the seizure was only a &quot;protective custodianship&quot; and violated no right of defendant public utility. Compulsory arbitration did not violate any constitutional rights of defendant public utility or defendant union. Complainant entrusted defendant public utility to provide an essential service and therefore had the right to require the parties to arbitrate to prevent disruption of service. There was no unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the Board of Arbitration. The legislature could classify public utility employees as a group and enact laws only affecting them without violating equal protection. Defendant union members were not deprived of individual liberty because they were free to reject employment with defendant public utility. Complainant could properly forbid striking in concert when the effect would disrupt essential services of a public utility.</SPAN></P>

Seizing the plant was merely &quot;protective custodianship&quot; and the defendant union members were free to leave their employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city recorder was indicted for misconduct in office related to his failure to report the facts of certain driving under the influence cases to the commissioner of motor vehicles as required by N.J.

The court rejected defendant's contention that the statute directing him to report was not mandatory, but directory, because the statute used the word &quot;shall&quot; and was therefore mandatory. The court held that the statute was not an unconstitutional conferring of judicial power on a clerk, but a proper delegation of ministerial functions necessary for the proper functioning of government. The court held that the indictment was not invalid on its face because the grand jury was authorized to make the indictment. Therefore, the court dismissed the writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A writ of certiorari was granted to review a resolution of respondent borough, which denied petitioner landowner's application for a permit to install gasoline tanks and pumps for a service station in a &quot;business&quot; district. The application followed the issuance of a building permit. The court dismissed the writ. Petitioner first argued that the regulation was arbitrary and unreasonable because the prohibition against service stations extended throughout the borough except the section reserved for &quot;industrial&quot; uses. The court held that the presumption of the ordinance's validity was not overthrown, and the court would not substitute its judgment for respondent's discretion, reasonably exercised. Next, the court rejected petitioner's assertion that the building permit, once granted and under which construction proceeded, may not be revoked subsequently. The court held that the proofs did not satisfy the court that petitioner made substantial expenditures on the faith of the building permit. Moreover, petitioner was aware that without tanks and pumps he could not use the premises as a gasoline filling station, and he made the expenditures fully cognizant of the risks involved.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the decision was affirmed. The court held that the proofs established that defendant's Regulation B-7 was adopted with a view to public safety, security and convenience alone, and not for the suppression of competition. The means adopted to that end were reasonable and appropriate, and were in no sense arbitrary or oppressive. The weight and dimensional standards prescribed by the regulation bore a real and substantial relation to safety in transportation. Further, there was no suggestion that the particular requirements, so long in effect in the state, were at variance with the established general standards obtained elsewhere. Finally, concern for the safety, comfort and convenience of passengers in interstate transportation whose trip began or ended in the State was not discriminatory in the vicious sense because the regulations were not made applicable to those of the class cited by prosecutor.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners argued that the legislature could not constitutionally distinguish between fourth class cities and other cities. The court found the statute constitutional and dismissed the writ. Cities of the fourth class were comprised of those cities along the ocean that were seaside or summer resorts. The proofs showed that the presence of summer visitors imposed an unusual burden upon municipal governments since they were required to increase facilities for police and fire protection due to the presence of summer tourists. The expenses of such cities were different from comparable inland cities. Thus, the classification was not arbitrary or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

It also held that there was sufficient evidence that the land to be received from the estate was at least of equal, if not a greater value, than the land which defendant municipality was conveying. Prosecutors failed to sustain their burden of proving the estate property was of a lesser value. Defendant municipality had acted in good faith in passing the resolution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant commission entered into an interstate compact for the purpose of controlling and abating pollution of the harbor, coastal and tidal waters pursuant to N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32:18-1. Defendant municipalities entered into a joint contract for the construction, maintenance and operation of a joint outlet relief sewer. Commission sought a mandatory injunction compelling defendants to cease from discharging untreated sewage into the sanitary district. The court concluded that complainant's orders were issued in accordance with the requirements of the compact and statute. The court found that a preliminary hearing was not absolutely requisite because &sect; 32:19-4 specifically authorized complainant to institute court action to restrain pollution and that the time within which the remedial action was to be taken was reasonable. The court dismissed the action as to the individual defendants finding that they were not necessary parties to the bill because they had ceased to hold municipal office.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 18:14-52, was unconstitutional because it violated the guaranty of personal and religious liberty. The court found that the question of compulsory vaccination was strictly a legislative question, and that the enactment of a statute requiring compulsory vaccination for the protection of local communities was a proper exercise of the legislative prerogative, and that such enactment did not deprive prosecutors of their constitutional guaranties to personal and religious liberties. The judiciary would review legislative action of a matter affecting the general welfare only when the action had no real or substantial relation to protecting the public health or welfare and was an invasion of rights secured by fundamental law. The court held that the resolution was a proper exercise of the police power and dismissed the writ.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prosecutor concrete company appealed respondent borough's denial of the recommendation of a local board of adjustment that prosecutor be granted an exception to a zoning ordinance. The ordinance placed heavy restrictions on the types and sizes of businesses that could exist within respondent, including restrictions on manufacturing and sales. Prosecutor alleged that the ordinance in question was an unconstitutional exercise of respondent's police power, and also that if the ordinance was found valid, that respondent erred in denying the recommendation of the board of adjustment. The court held that although a municipality could enact zoning restrictions to protect the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare, it could not otherwise interfere with an owner's use of his property. The court could not find authority for the extreme restrictions imposed by respondent's ordinance, and deemed the ordinance to be an impermissible exercise of police power. The court therefore set aside the decisions of both respondent and the board of adjustment as based on an invalid ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer sold used motor vehicles sales and parts of used vehicles, on different sides of the same street. Plaintiff claimed that an ordinance of defendant borough on its face and as applied to plaintiff was arbitrary, discriminatory, and unreasonable, because another taxpayer conducted the same business but was required to obtain only one license for that location. Further the ordinance did not apply to new car businesses. In rejecting plaintiff's claim, the court observed that an ordinance requiring plaintiff to obtain a license and pay a license fee for each distinct and separate location of its businesses constituted an exercise of regulatory and revenue functions. The ordinance did not contravene due process or equal protection of the law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that the difference in classification, based upon either location of separate and distinct businesses, or upon only used car businesses, was reasonable because the difference had a fair and substantial relation to the object of the ordinance which was raising revenue and protecting the public welfare from trade practices particular to sales of used motor vehicles and used parts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company challenged a determination by the Board of Adjustment of the Village of Ridgewood (New Jersey), that denied plaintiff's applications for a special exception to a zoning ordinance to extend its non-conforming use to adjacent vacant land pursuant to Ridgewood, N.J., Classes of Zones Ordinance &sect; 2 (1931), and to erect a fence around the premises, under Ridgewood, N.J., Building Ordinance &sect; 50.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company operated a coal and lumber storage business. Plaintiff filed applications to extend its non-conforming use to its adjacent vacant land, and to erect a fence around the premises. Both applications were denied pursuant to Ridgewood, N.J., Classes of Zones Ordinance, &sect; 2 (1931), and Ridgewood, N.J., Building Ordinance &sect; 50. Plaintiff appealed, but to no avail. The court affirmed the denials. It rejected plaintiff's contention that an extension of its existing non-conforming use to adjoining vacant land could legally be made, based upon the court's previous determination that although a non-conforming use could be continued, it could not be enlarged or extended. Similarly, the court rejected plaintiff's claim that the vacant land had previously been used as a non-conforming use therefore again it could legally be extended. The court held that plaintiff's prospective use was substantially different than the prior non-conforming use, therefore it could not be made. Noting that a municipality had the statutory authority to regulate fencing, N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:48-1(29), the court held that denial of plaintiff fencing application was proper under &sect; 50.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:14-12. Plaintiffs contended that not being placed on the election ballots in the first column infringed upon voters' ability to cast a meaningful and fully weighted vote in violation of the one-man one-vote rule. The court dismissed the claim; concluding plaintiffs' argument was patently flawed. The court explained that what was at stake was not the ability of voters to cast a meaningful vote, but instead plaintiffs' opportunity to obtain meaningless votes. The court noted there was a notion that the candidate who occupied the first column received a substantial number of extra votes from uninformed and uninterested voters. The court explained that state election regulations were not unconstitutional unless the right to vote was significantly encroached upon. The court concluded there was no basis for affording protection to plaintiffs' urged right to an equal opportunity to acquire the &quot;windfall&quot; vote. The court found plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, police officers, sought a preliminary injunction preventing defendant state police division from enforcing a regulation restricting their speech. Plaintiffs' claim included federal claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 2000e-1, and state claims under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:19-3(a), and the New Jersey Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, police officers, challenged the constitutionality of a policy regulating the manner in which members of the state police disclosed information or disseminated documents to the public on matters concerning the division and its operations, policies, and practices, by requiring prior approval of the agency. They brought their action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 2000e, as well as under state statutes. The court granted plaintiffs' request for preliminary injunction, and held that the regulation was overbroad and imposed a prior restraint on speech in violation of the U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. The court found that plaintiffs had demonstrated irreparable harm, a settled legal right, and a likelihood of success on the merits of their speech claim. Hence, the court overruled two sections of the regulation in dispute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted plaintiff officers' motion for preliminary injunction, as it applied to two sections of the regulation in dispute, because plaintiffs demonstrated that the regulation was unconstitutional because it was overbroad and operated as a prior restraint. The court found that plaintiffs successfully demonstrated their likelihood of success on the merits, as well as irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

Before the sentencing hearing, defendant requested the prosecutor to make an application to the assignment judge pursuant to N.J. Stat.

When the prosecutor refused to do so, defendant sought review contending that the decision was arbitrary and unconstitutional. The court denied defendant's application for a hearing because he failed to establish prima facie either a showing of arbitrariness constituting an unconstitutional discrimination or an unconstitutional denial of equal protection constituting a manifest injustice. The court noted that the penalties imposed by the Graves Act were intentionally harsh. Hence, the court ruled that the prosecutor's decision not to apply for reduction in the mandatory minimum penalty in this case where defendant pointed a loaded handgun at the victims, threatened them and then accidentally shot himself was not arbitrary but was consistent with the legislative goal of deterrence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When she was 15-years old, petitioner adoptive daughter was adopted by her adoptive parents. Six years later after her adoptive parents had divorced and she and her adoptive father had conceived a child together, petitioner moved to vacate the judgment of adoption as to her adoptive father only, intending thereafter to marry him. In granting petitioner's motion and vacating the order of adoption as to the adoptive father, the court concluded that setting aside the judgment was clearly in the best interests of the adoptive child and the adoptive parents. Petitioner had reached the age of majority, she was the natural mother of an infant son whose biological father was her adoptive father, and she was intent upon marrying her adoptive father. Vacating the judgment of adoption would permit the parties to marry, thereby legitimizing their son. The absence of any evidence of abuse, neglect, domestic violence, or other unlawful acts suggested that petitioner had made a conscious decision to transform the father-daughter relationship into one of husband and wife.</SPAN></P>

Defendant fire commissioners contended that the legislation, which created length of service awards but exempted existing programs, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners association brought an action against defendant fire commissioners in lieu of prerogative writs, which requested that the court declare portions of 1997 N.J. Laws 388 unconstitutional. The law created a length of service award program for fire or first aid organizations and exempted existing programs from its requirements. The court found that the legislature had the right to create reasonable classifications and, notwithstanding the potential injustice of the legislation, the distinctions that were drawn were not so unreasonable as to be totally unrelated to any conceivable purpose. The court opined that it was the legislature's right to make policy decisions about health, safety, and welfare and short of it constituting invidious discrimination, it was not the court's role to interfere. Further, the court was satisfied that the legislation was not violative of the proscriptions in N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VII, para. 9(8) against private, special, or local laws. Finally, the legislation did not create a retroactive tax, and the retroactive application of the statute did not rise to the level of manifest injustice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the public law was constitutional because the legislature's classification was sustainable, the statutory distinction between the two types of fire districts and the differentiation between those who may and may not vote was reasonably relevant to the purposes and object of the act and did not constitute special legislation, and the retroactive application of the statute did not rise to the level of manifest injustice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county health department appealed an order from the trial court (New Jersey), dismissing its civil suit against defendant waste hauler for violation of the Solid Waste Management Act, N.J.

Defendant claimed the appellate court lacked jurisdiction, the suit violated double jeopardy, and that the penalties were excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county health department brought a civil action against defendant solid waste hauler, alleging it improperly disposed of out-of-county waste and did not fill out forms properly, in violation of the Solid Waste Management Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13:1E-1 to 13:1E-207, and N.J. Admin. Code tit. 7, &sect;&sect; 26-6.5(m) and 26-2.13(c)(2). Judgment for defendant was entered. Plaintiff appealed. Defendant claimed that the appellate court lacked jurisdiction, the suit violated double jeopardy, and it was entitled to rely upon a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) memo regarding waste disposal. The appellate court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Because the Act's penalties and mechanisms were civil in nature, the court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and double jeopardy was inapplicable. Because a federal court found the state's waste flow laws were unconstitutional, under the doctrines of comity and retroactivity, defendant could not be held in violation of them. Because defendant transported out of county waste to a landfill and failed to record the waste's origin, penalties were assessable. The court ordered a hearing to determine such penalties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court's dismissal of plaintiff county health department's civil suit charging that defendant waste hauler violated waste flow control laws and procedures. Under principles of comity, the court accepted a federal court's holding that the state's waste control laws were unconstitutional. However, penalties could be assessed for defendant's failure to properly fill out forms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mortgage corporation filed a complaint for foreclosure. Defendants, condominium association, the state, individuals, and credit company, challenged the priority of the lien of the plaintiff's first mortgage. Plaintiff and defendants filed a motion for summary judgment and a cross-motion for summary judgment, respectively. Defendants relied on N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46:8B-21, effective April 1, 1996, which created a condominium association lien. The questions raised were ones of first impression. The court granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, but denied plaintiff's motion for attorney fees. At the time of the mortgage agreement in 1992, plaintiff could not have considered the possibility of a condominium association lien taking priority because &sect; 46:8B-21, the statute granting the association a priority, was not enacted until almost four years later. The court concluded that plaintiff had a legitimate expectation that in a case of default, the property would revert to plaintiff unencumbered by liens other than those already given a priority by statute, such as taxes or municipal liens.</SPAN></P>

Over the course of several years, the case went from the New Jersey Supreme Court, to the Appellate Division, to the Office of Administrative Law, and back to the superior and supreme courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff children filed suit against defendant state officials alleging that the Public School Education Act of 1975, N.J.

Ann. &sect; 18A: 7A-1 to 52, was unconstitutional because it contributed to the disparities between property-rich and property-poor school districts and denied plaintiffs an efficient education. The case went back and forth between various courts until the supreme court held that the newly enacted Comprehensive Educational Improvement and Financing Act of 1996, N.J. Stat. Ann. 18A: 7F-1 to -34, was unconstitutional as applied to Special Needs Districts (SNDs) and remanded issues of supplemental programs and facilities needs to the court. The court held, among other things, that the state needed to maintain the SNDs at the spending level of the economically privileged districts, that the SNDs needed to adopt a full-day kindergarten, adopt a full-day program for preschool children, reduce in class size, and have either summer school or an extended term. The court held that additional classroom space was needed, but stated that a more detailed school-by-school evaluation was needed before further costs could be established.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff land owners met with a representative of defendant New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and were informed that it was highly unlikely plaintiffs would receive a permit to construct a proposed office project due to wetlands located on the property. Consequently, plaintiffs abandoned their effort to obtain regulatory approval for any development of the property and filed this action seeking a declaration of inverse condemnation. The court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs' cross-motion because the cause was not ripe. The court noted that the regulatory scheme at issue permitted the issuance of variances in certain circumstances and held that, to ripen their claim, plaintiffs were required to actually seek such a variance. Additionally, the court noted that plaintiffs had not provided evidence that they had considered alternatives to the planned construction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant drug manufacturer challenged the constitutionality of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-26.1 (the Act), which effectively extended the limitations period for certain civil suits against proprietary plasma processors. Plaintiff Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) victim moved to strike defendant's affirmative defense and urged that the Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) victim brought his action against defendant drug manufacturer and contended that he contracted AIDS after he took a medicine prescribed for the treatment of hemophilia that was manufactured by defendant. The court found that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-26.1 (the Act), revived cause of action of plaintiff, for one year. The court held that the Act did not violate the substantive due process and equal protection provisions of N.J. Const. art. I, para. 1, and was not contrary to the ban on special legislation in N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; vii, para. 9. The court ruled that the limitations defense was not irrevocable nor a &quot;fully-perfected&quot; defense. The court held that the legislature's method of addressing the procedural concerns raised by the number of AIDS-related cases advanced legitimate governmental objectives, because by setting the accrual date, the Act had the dual effect of extending the limitations period for those infected by tainted blood products, while at the same time, triggering the &quot;discovery date&quot; for future filings. The court found that the benefits flowing from the Act outweighed the burdens imposed upon defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the challenged legislation rationally advanced the legitimate objective of spreading the costs associated with the treatment of the infected hemophiliac population, and did not violate any provisions of the U.S. or New Jersey Constitutions. The court denied defendant drug manufacturer's application and granted plaintiff Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome victim's cross motion to dismiss defendant's affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant storeowners appealed from judgments of the trial court (New Jersey), which convicted them of violating an ordinance of plaintiff township prohibiting signs illuminated by neon. Defendants claimed that the ordinance violated infringed upon freedom of speech in violation of U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV, and was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff township adopted an ordinance prohibiting signs lit by neon tubes. Defendant storeowners, who had illuminated neon signs in their stores, were convicted of violating the ordinance. The court reversed the convictions. The ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague. Although the ordinance was content neutral, and left open ample alternative channels for communication of information, it was an impermissible restriction on commercial speech in violation of U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV because there was no showing that the restriction on illuminated neon related to the aesthetic goal the ordinance was supposedly designed to achieve. The record was devoid of evidence establishing that neon in and of itself, without other less restrictive methods to regulate its use, such as through size, degree of illumination or brightness, or number, improperly contributed to the unwanted &quot;highway&quot; commercial look.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant storeowners' convictions were reversed. Plaintiff township failed to prove that illuminated neon, as distinguished from other types of illumination, was offensive to the aesthetic goal of the ordinance that prohibited illuminated neon signs. Accordingly, it was an impermissible restriction on commercial advertising.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was a candidate for the position of chairman of the county Democratic committee. Plaintiff brought an action against defendant incumbent chairman alleging violations of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:5-3, the bylaws of the committee, and the committee's traditional practices and procedures in connection with the election of officers. Plaintiff questioned whether his announced rival for the position of chair, a woman, could be elected with a candidate for vice-chair, also a woman, in derogation of the apparent dictate of &sect; 19:5-3. The court briefly stayed the election and ordered briefs. Ultimately, the court ruled that the election was valid and declared &sect; 19:5-3&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court found that &sect; 19:5-3 limited New Jersey political parties' discretion in how to organize themselves and select their leaders, thus burdening the associational rights of the parties and their members. Further, the court held that the statute did not serve a compelling state interest, finding that the requirement of one man and one woman in the positions of chair and vice-chair did not serve to ensure an &quot;orderly and fair&quot; election process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree robbery, second degree aggravated assault, and third degree aggravated assault. Because of his prior convictions for similar offenses, he was eligible for imposition of a life sentence without possibility of parole pursuant to the Persistent Offenders Accountability Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-7.1. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the Act. The court upheld its constitutionality and sentenced defendant accordingly. The Act was not an ex post facto law. A statute which provided for increased punishment for an offender who had previously been convicted was not ex post facto merely because the previous convictions took place before the Act's enactment. Further, the prior convictions were only considered for purposes of sentencing on an offense that took place after the Act was effective. There was also no separation of powers violation. The court also held that the Act's imposition of a life sentence did not violate the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment because the punishment was not grossly disproportionate to the offense and did not go beyond the legitimate penal goals of retribution and deterrence.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 52:27D-301 through -329. Plaintiff sought the rezoning of plaintiff's property to permit the construction of conventional single-family detached houses and low and moderate income housing units. Plaintiff asserted, and the court agreed, that defendants' poor record of fulfilling low and moderate income housing was the result of a number of factors. The factors included environmental constraints on the inclusionary sites; public sewer policies, public resistance and processing delays in the approval of inclusionary sites, and unnecessary cost-generating requirements and restrictive zoning requirements that imposed restraints on the market units within the inclusionary sites. Therefore, the court concluded that defendants' inclusionary zoning plan was not in compliance and was unconstitutional. The court held that plaintiff was entitled to a builder's remedy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, county employee unions and associations, in an action against defendant county, challenged the County Board of Chosen Freeholders' (board) resolution containing a residency requirement, asserting that the enactment was not a valid exercise of its legislative power, that members of the sheriff's and prosecutor's offices were not subject to the requirement, and that the requirement was void because it was passed by resolution rather than by ordinance. The court sustained plaintiffs' challenge and issued a preliminary injunction, holding that although the requirement was a valid exercise of the board's power under the statutes in effect at the time of the resolution, the members of the sheriff's and prosecutor's offices were not subject to the requirement because both the prosecutor and the sheriff, not defendant, were the exclusive hiring authorities for their offices.

The court held that the interrogatories were not a seizure within the meaning of U.S. Const. amend.

Moreover, &sect; 2C:41-5 provided safeguards directed towards the type of information sought, not the status of the person served. Thus, if the interrogatories were served upon a target of an investigation, those protections were available.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant town adopted an ordinance that prohibited cigarette vending machines. The court accepted plaintiff vendors' explanation that a locking device was 100 percent effective in preventing unsupervised sales from cigarette machines, but found that the machines in question, no matter how triggered, were vending machines within the meaning of the ordinance. The court could not say that defendant's decision to ban cigarette vending machines was irrational because it might have been able to restrict cigarette sales to minors some other way. Thus, the court found that the ordinance did not violate the equal protection clause. The court concluded that the ordinance was not a taking because its interference with plaintiffs' businesses was a necessary and noncompensable consequence of a reasonable exercise of defendant's police power to promote the public health by eliminating one of the sources of cigarette sales to minors. The court upheld the ordinance and concluded that the ordinance did not violate the contracts clause because it found a legitimate state purpose and a showing of a reasonable relationship between the goal and the means selected to accomplish it.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff lessee applied for a certification of continued occupancy to operate a video and bookstore. The application was denied when plaintiff did not provide specific information about its sale and rental items. Plaintiff filed a complaint in lieu of prerogative writs against defendants, township committee and various officials, in which plaintiff challenged the constitutional validity of the ordinance. The court held that plaintiff's challenge to the validity of the ordinance was not time barred under N.J. Ct. R. 4:69-6(a) because plaintiff was seeking declaratory relief and asserting constitutional violations. However, the court held that the issue was not ripe for resolution because the factual record had not been fully developed. Moreover, further factual development might render the constitutional challenge moot. The court directed plaintiff to file an application for an interpretation pursuant to N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Atlantic City Municipal Court (New Jersey) convicting him of obstructing the administration of law under N.J.

Const. art. 1, para. 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers received an anonymous call that a woman at a certain address had been shot and needed help. Police responded to the location but found no victim. Police knocked on the door of a rooming house across the street and asked permission to look inside. Defendant refused to permit the officers to enter without a search warrant and slammed the door. The officers then broke through the door, searched the house, and found nothing. Defendant was tried and convicted of obstructing the administration of law under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:29-1a. On review, defendant argued that he could not be convicted for asserting his rights under the U.S. Const. amend. IV and N.J. Const. art. 1, para. 7. The appeals court agreed and reversed the conviction. The court reasoned that to make a warrantless entry based on exigent circumstances probable cause must exist. The court ruled that the officers lacked probable cause to enter the premises because the initial address was incorrect, and the officers received no corroboration that a shooting had occurred or that it had occurred at defendant's address. Thus, defendant was not required yield to the police demand for entry into a private dwelling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court reversed defendant's conviction for obstructing the administration of law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff association brought an action challenging the constitutionality of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:2H-7.3, asserting that the statute violated the Establishment Clause of U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To regulate the bed capacity of health care facilities, the legislature enacted N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:2H-7.3, which exempted nursing homes affiliated with well-established religious bodies from statutory requirements if at least 65 percent of the bed capacity was occupied by members of the religious body. Plaintiff association filed suit challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 26:2H-7.3, asserting that the exemption violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. I. The court declared the statute unconstitutional. The court ruled that &sect; 26:2H-7.3 did not advance the state's secular goal of providing health care to its residents, but instead had the effect of directly advancing religion. The court noted that religiously-affiliated facilities which qualified under the statute undoubtedly would enjoy a sizable competitive advantage over non-religiously-affiliated facilities which were still subject to rigorous statutory requirements. Moreover, the statute drew a distinction favoring some religious groups over others since it was limited to well-established religious bodies or denominations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wife was declared incompetent, and husband was appointed guardian. They owned a house and other property jointly, but husband had obtained a loan on commercial property solely in his name, which had been secured through the use of the jointly owned collateral. Husband died and plaintiffs, his children, were appointed co-guardians over their mother. Defendant bank sought to collect as the first mortgage holder on the property. Plaintiffs asserted that the mortgage was invalid as husband had failed to obtain court permission before disposing of property. Defendant claimed that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3B:14-23 no longer required court approval before sale. The court agreed the new statute didn't require court approval prior to mortgaging his ward's lands, unless required to do so by the appointing authority. However, the court held that the ward's property was not vigorously protected and that husband had acted improperly and under a conflict when he purchased solely titled property. The court held that the voiding provisions of &sect; 3B:14-36 were applicable because although bank knew of the guardianship, it allowed the transactions anyway, which showed less than good faith on its part.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that under the totality of the circumstances defendant's bank's request for payment under the mortgage transaction was void. It said that the previous guardian had breached his fiduciary duty by selling jointly-held property, and buying other property in his name only without court approval for the sale. It also said that bank had not acted in good faith as it was aware of the guardianship, but ignored it.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that defendant's petition was not time barred and the state sought reconsideration. The court, on reconsideration, affirmed defendant's conviction and found that the ultimate question on the propriety of foreign convictions was whether the conviction was fundamentally fair to defendant. The court found that in this case, defendant dismissed his counsel three-quarters of the way through trial and then refused to proceed pro se. The court found that this was a cat and mouse game of deliberate strategic maneuvering and that defendant had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel, thus making the foreign conviction fundamentally fair and properly usable to impose an extended sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were three juvenile males that had been charged with the aggravated sexual assault of a 10 year old, mentally retarded girl. The state, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:4A-43.1, 2C:43-2.2a, sought to compel defendants to submit to mandatory HIV testing. Defendants challenged the constitutionality of the statutes. The court, on appeal, found that the statutes were an unconstitutional violation of defendants' right to privacy and violated their U.S. Const. Amend. IV, XIV rights. The court determined that a balancing was necessary between the special needs of the results of the test and the government's interest in assisting sexual assault victims. The court found that the invasion of defendants' privacy did not bear a close and substantial relation to the compelling government interest of assisting victims of sexual assault when the fact of defendants' HIV status was not even admissible evidence and would not change the course of action that the victim would have had to take in order to insure that she was not infected with HIV or AIDS, especially in light of the fact that the victim was not prohibited from disseminating the defendants' HIV status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, convicted sex offender, sought a preliminary injunction against defendants Attorney General and law enforcement agencies, to prevent them from enforcing the registration and notification requirements of Megan's Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:7-1 et seq. Plaintiff challenged the statute on equal protection and ex post facto grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, convicted sex offender, had been ordered to register under the provisions of Megan's Law ( the Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:7-1 et seq. The court found that the Act compelled plaintiff to register within 120 days of the effective date of the Act, verify his address every 90 days with the local police department, be subject to the provisions of the Act for at least 15 years after his release from prison, and be subject to public release of information necessary for public protection. Although it found the Act to be retrospective, the court found that the Act was not ex post facto legislation, because the registration requirement was not punishment. The court looked to the legislative intent to determine that the Act was protective rather than punitive in nature. The court rejected plaintiff's argument that the Act was a bill of attainder or cruel and unusual punishment, and ruled that it did not subject plaintiff to double jeopardy. The court found that defendant Attorney General had failed to comply with the Administrative Procedures Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:14B-1 et seq., however and declared the registration guidelines thus adopted void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petition of plaintiff, convicted sex offender, for an order to show cause to prevent defendants, Attorney General and law enforcement agencies, from enforcing the provisions of Megan's Law. The court ordered plaintiff to register as a convicted sex offender. The court ordered defendant to comply with statutory hearing requirements prior to adopting regulations to implement the public notification portions of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the claim, then granted reconsideration and ruled against defendant. The court then granted a motion for a new trial and allowed the United States' motion to intervene. The court awarded plaintiff damages of $ 500 per call after defendant had notice that plaintiff wanted no more calls and granted an injunction against continued calls. The court found the part of the statute that applied, 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 227(c)(2), was constitutional because it provided an appropriate restriction on commercial speech related to a serious problem in proportion to the interest addressed and was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

I and XIV, and to direct that the Senate candidate's name be placed in the same column on the ballot as the other Democratic candidates endorsed by the Democratic Committee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff candidate for the U.S. Senate sought to have his name included in the column with other candidates endorsed by a political party on the primary ballot. Defendant county clerk resisted grouping the candidate together with other candidates endorsed by the party, citing N.J. Stat. Ann., tit. 19, &sect; 23-26.1 which required that the U.S. Senate candidate and the candidate for Governor be listed separately. After an action was filed by plaintiffs, the court ordered that the ballot be printed with plaintiff candidate's name listed among the other endorsed candidates. Because this relief was not final as to the constitutionality of the statute, the court ordered the parties to file cross-motions for summary judgment on this issue. The court found that the statute's prohibition on grouping candidates for U.S. Senate and Governor in the same column with other candidates endorsed by the political party burdened plaintiffs' rights of free speech and association while serving no compelling state interest. It therefore held that N.J. Stat. Ann., tit. 19, &sect; 23-26.1 violated U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV as well as the New Jersey Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a husband and injured wife, asserted personal injury and per quod claims against defendant, plaintiff wife's employer, for injuries plaintiff wife sustained during the course of her employment. Liability and damages were hotly contested and involved significant past injuries and a large workers' compensation lien. At arbitration, plaintiff wife's testimony was cut short by an arbitrator and never finished. The arbitrators entered a decision that plaintiff wife was totally responsible for the accident and defendant filed a motion to confirm the award after 30 days had passed without plaintiffs filing for trial de novo. In denying defendant's motion, the court held that where the arbitrators' testimony established that their primary motivation for the award was to provide a vehicle with which plaintiffs' attorney could obtain a compromise of the compensation lien in order to bring about a settlement, the conclusion by plaintiffs' attorney that he was not required to demand a trial de novo during ongoing efforts to settle was justified under N.J.

Defendant, in a post-judgment plenary application, sought termination of the joint custody agreement terms requiring him to pay non-public, primary school tuition for the couple's two children. Defendant asserted that requiring him to make payments infringed on his U.S. Const. amend. I and state freedom of religion rights. Plaintiff, as primary residential parent, sought enforcement. The court held defendant was bound by law, by the terms of the joint custody agreement, to contribute his pro rata share of the tuition. The court held the children's attendance at a religious private school in no way interfered with defendant's right to practice his religion. The court held defendant was entirely responsible for the private school tuition for the year 1992-93, that he was obligated to reimburse plaintiff pro rata for the school year 1993-94. The court held it would schedule a hearing to determine the pro rata share according to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:34-23 and to consider defendant's contribution for the upcoming year.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2-7.1, seeking grandchildren visitation rights. Defendant parents moved to dismiss plaintiff's complaint and contended that &sect; 9:2-7.1 was unconstitutional as applied to them, an intact family, and violated defendants' right to raise and care for their children as they saw fit pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court upheld the New Jersey Grandparent Visitation Statute, holding that it clearly employed fundamentally fair procedures, it was not arbitrary or capricious, and could be said equally to balance the interest of all parties involved. The court reasoned that government intrusion into parents' rights to rear children was justified because the acts of individuals, especially minors, were subject to regulation by the states so long as the regulation had a reasonable relation to the legitimate interest of the state, and the action was not arbitrary or capricious. The court concluded that the New Jersey statute was rationally related to the legitimate interest of the state of New Jersey in promoting grandparent-grandchild relationships.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court was asked to apply the sentencing provisions for juvenile motor vehicle offenses contained in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:4A-43(e)(2), -(f) to juvenile. It found that juvenile was a repeat offender as defined by &sect; 2A:4A-43(e) because the statute's language encompassed any previous adjudications for the listed offenses, not just those which postdated the passage of the act. The court held that the crediting of time served was a matter of substantive law and not a question of practice and procedure; thus, N.J. Ct. R. 5:21-3(e), which directed courts to credit juveniles with time served, had to yield to the contrary legislative mandate of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:4A-43(f)(1). However, the court held that &sect; 2A:4A-43(f)(1) violated the equal protection guarantee of U.S. Const. amend. XIV because the disparate treatment of juveniles and adults in the context of credit for time served was not rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective. The court found that the fact that juveniles who were detained preadjudication would serve longer periods of incarceration than those who were released pending resolution of the charges raised a second equal protection problem.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that a statute proscribing credit for time served for juvenile motor vehicle offenses bore no rational relationship to any legitimate governmental interest and thus deprived the disadvantaged class of the equal protection of the law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.

In this fact-sensitive analysis, the court noted that the child would be living with defendant and her siblings most of the time. As plaintiff lived 2500 miles away, it would be safer for the child to use a locally identifiable name in the event that she was required to verbally identify herself.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured parties brought an action against defendant tortfeasors to recover damages for the pain and suffering they sustained as a result of an automobile accident. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that plaintiffs had not met the verbal threshold under the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:6A-1 to -35. Plaintiffs filed a motion for an order declaring that the verbal threshold statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:6A-8 was unconstitutional. The court denied plaintiffs' motion because &sect; 39:6A-8 did not implicate plaintiffs' fundamental rights to trial by jury or access to the courts, people who could not afford the no-threshold premium were not a suspect class, and, under federal and state equal protection standards, the classifications made by &sect; 39:6A-8 suitably furthered and were rationally related to the state's legitimate objective of reforming automobile insurance. The court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the actions brought by the minor plaintiffs because plaintiffs failed to show by credible, objective medical evidence that they sustained one of the serious injuries enumerated in N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city filed a verified complaint with the emergent duty judge (New Jersey) and obtained a temporary commitment order and an order to show cause. Plaintiff sought a final order committing defendant to a local hospital until the state commissioner of health was satisfied that defendant had recovered to the extent he was not a menace to the community. This opinion amplified oral findings rendered at the conclusion of a commitment hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case presented novel issues that surrounded tuberculosis (TB). It required a review of the state's TB control statute to determine if it fulfilled due process requirements and complied with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 12101-12213. The opinion amplified findings rendered in defendant's commitment hearing. The emergent duty judge determined that there was statutory authority to have involuntarily committed a person with TB to a hospital and that the procedures applicable to involuntary civil commitments must have been followed. If the procedures were adhered to and the least restrictive means of treatment was determined, the requirements of both due process and the ADA would have been fulfilled. The procedures employed here complied with due process and plaintiff city proved the need for defendant's commitment. The ADA was satisfied, as the decision was based upon the nature of the risk as to how TB was transmitted, the duration of the risk as to how long defendant was infectious, the severity of the risk as to what the potential harm to third parties was, and the probabilities the disease would have been transmitted or caused harm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of commitment was granted and was to have incorporated by reference defendant patient's rights as set forth in the applicable laws regarding civil commitments, to the extent feasible and practical. As long as involuntary civil commitment procedures were followed, there was authority to have involuntarily committed a person with tuberculosis to a hospital. Any provisions that related only to mental health issues needed not apply.</SPAN></P>

New Jersey RICO, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:41-1.1c, required evidence that plaintiff and third-party defendants agreed to participate or conspired to commit at least two racketeering acts. N.J. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff cellular telephone company applied to defendant planning board for a height variance and site plan approval to develop and operate a base station and a 160-foot antenna tower. Plaintiff sought to locate the tower in a lot with an operating warehouse and a shopping center, but the maximum height permitted was 30 feet. Defendant concluded that the tower would cause a detrimental impact to the area and denied plaintiff's application. The court remanded the matter to defendant to reconsider plaintiff's plan and variance application in conformance with its opinion. The court found that defendant, as opposed to the Zoning Board of Adjustment, had jurisdiction over the issue because the antenna was an accessory use rather than a principal structure. The court held that defendant's decision was deficient because defendant did not engage in a balancing test of beneficial use, considered electromagnetic radiation, and failed to articulate a sufficient basis for its conclusions.

R. 4:59, to a levy placed upon defendant's bank accounts by plaintiff apartment building owner, who complained of defendant's non-payment of rent. Plaintiff cross-moved for an order compelling a turnover of the funds that had been levied upon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant housing authority entered into a lease with plaintiff apartment owner's predecessor in title whereby defendant leased apartment units from plaintiff for low-income housing. Plaintiff brought an action due to defendant's failure to pay rent. Defendant contended that it would pay its debt when it was financially able. Trial courts granted plaintiff judgments against defendant, which were satisfied by levy of defendant's bank accounts, to which defendant objected. The court found that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:12A-34 exempted defendant from levies for unpaid rent by virtue of execution. The court held that &sect; 40A:12A-34 did not violate the takings clause of U.S. Const. amend. V and N.J. Const. art. 1, para. 20, as the statute only prevented a levy against defendant's bank accounts, and did not absolve defendant from liability for its debts. The court found that &sect; 40A:12A-34 did not violate the Contracts Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1, or the Due Process Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court found that plaintiff's proper remedy was a writ of mandamus, and in the interest of judicial economy, issued an order directing plaintiff's payment to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Rehabilitator sought approval of the subject insolvent insurer's rehabilitation plan under the Uniform Insurers Liquidation Act, N.J.

The plan prioritized claims of policyholders over objector unsecured creditors pursuant to the Life and Health Insurers Rehabilitation and Liquidation Act (RLA), N.J. Stat.

The court concluded that the RLA retroactively applied to subject's rehabilitation and was not manifestly unjust because it was remedial. It was also constitutional because it reasonably served the legitimate purpose of protecting policyholders without discriminating, and objectors did not have a property right or a vested right to pari passu treatment. The court invalidated &sect; 17B:32-37(b) because it unconstitutionally preferred one unsecured creditor, absent public need. The court found that the plan and the application of RLA was fair and equitable with some modifications. It ordered the reclassification of bank agreements as annuities and administrative expenses. It also ordered distribution of capital to objectors, and provided them membership on a committee to distribute surplus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city implemented an affirmative action plan and plaintiffs, bidder and property owner, challenged the constitutionality of the plan. Plaintiffs argued that the plan violated the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, and discriminated against non-minorities under the N.J. Constitution and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court held that the plan as amended was constitutional on its face and dismissed plaintiffs' complaint. The court concluded that the plan as amended was constitutional because it eliminated the remedies for noncompliance which resulted in the required ten percent minority participation being merely a goal to encourage nondiscrimination in future contracts. Therefore, the court held that the plan did not establish racial or ethnic quotas, which would have rendered the plan unconstitutional under a recent Supreme Court ruling which changed the legal landscape in evaluating the constitutionality of affirmative action ordinances. Moreover, the court held that as amended the plan did not create suspect classes based upon racial or ethnic criteria, which would have required a strict scrutiny test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A 17 year old juvenile was charged with aggravated sexual assault, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:14-2, and endangering the welfare of a child he was supervising, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:24-4. The state brought a motion to transfer the matter to an adult criminal court pursuant to the jurisdictional waiver statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:4A-26 and N.J. Ct. R. 5:22-2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the two phase jurisdictional waiver statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:4A-26, and N.J. Ct. R. 5:22-2, the state sought to have a juvenile matter transferred to an adult criminal court. The juvenile was charged with aggravated sexual assault, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:14-2, and endangering the welfare of a child he was supervising, N.J. Stat. &sect; 2C:24-4. The juvenile offered no evidence that he could be rehabilitated in phase two, and thus he offered no reason why his case should not be transferred. However, the court found that the juvenile could offer no such evidence unless he admitted to wrongdoing, which violated his right to be free from self-incrimination under U.S. Const. amend. V. The court held that to require this admission of wrongdoing in order to receive the right to remain in juvenile court rendered the first part of phase two of the statute unconstitutional. Thus, the court declared that a juvenile need not answer the rehabilitation question and that part of the phase was omitted. However, because the court found that society's need for deterrence outweighed the juvenile's rights to be rehabilitated based on the circumstances, the motion to transfer was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the state's motion to transfer a juvenile's case from juvenile court to an adult criminal court, as it found that society's rights outweighed the juvenile's right to rehabilitation based on the circumstances. However, the court ordered that part one of phase two be omitted as it was unconstitutional to require a juvenile to admit he could be rehabilitated, and thus admit to wrongdoing in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured was injured in an automobile accident and filed suit. Defendant insurer paid plaintiff's medical expenses although she was not the owner of the vehicle involved in the accident. Plaintiff filed a claim against defendant for payments under the Personal Injury Protection benefits of her son-in-law's automobile policy. The court originally determined that, as a matter of statutory construction, the deductible and set-off provisions in the policy did not apply to plaintiff because she was not a &quot;resident relative&quot; within her son-in-law's household. However, the court's decision was reversed on further appeal because plaintiff was such a resident relative. On remand, the court denied plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the ground that she was subject to the limitations found in the son-in-laws policy because of her status as a resident relative. The court found that plaintiff was bound by the cost containment options which her son-in-law had selected as head of the household. As to plaintiff's argument that the statute was unconstitutional, the court held that plaintiff did not identify a liberty or property interest at stake.</SPAN></P>

The court conducted a trial de novo on the record and found defendants guilty, rejecting their argument that the university was sufficiently devoted to public use as to be covered by U.S. Const. amend I. Unlike the university in the case cited by defendants, it found, the university here did not encourage a policy of openness with regard to its facilities. The court noted that its campus was enclosed, not geographically integrated with the town; that it did not allow outsiders on campus without sponsorship or other permission; and that the public was invited on campus only for certain events, such as basketball games. Therefore, it concluded, the university was not an &quot;open&quot; campus for First Amendment purposes. It rejected defendants' argument that they had a defense of mistake or ignorance of the law under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:2-4, finding that defendants had not shown either that they relied on an official statement of law that was later declared invalid or erroneous or that they diligently investigated the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants moved to suppress handgun evidence found in a car they occupied when stopped by a police officer. Defendants were arrested for possession of a handgun in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:39-5(b). The police stop was made on the basis that the car had tinted windows. Defendants contended that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:3-74 did not prohibit tinted windows on cars.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were riding in a car and were stopped by a police officer. Upon the stop, neither defendant could produce a driver's license, and the registered owner's last name was different from those of defendants. The officer stopped the car on the basis of a tinted windshield. One of defendants consented to a search of the car, and a gun was found in the car. Defendants moved to suppress the gun evidence. Defendants apparently contended that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:3-74 did not prohibit transparent material. The court found that it was arguable that &sect; 39:3-74 did not apply to tinted material, but N.J. Admin. Code tit. 13, &sect; 20-33.6 specifically prohibited the use of tinted materials that did not meet certain standards. Ergo, the court found that the stop of the car that defendants were riding in was legal. Even if it were found later that material did not violate New Jersey law, that would not invalidate a stop. The court did not accept defendants' argument that, even if the initial stop were legal, the consent to search was invalidly obtained because of unlawful detention. The court found that the field detention here was not unconstitutional. The court denied defendants' motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendants' motion. The court held that tinted windows on a motor vehicle did give rise to an articulable and reasonable suspicion of a motor vehicle violation, and, therefore, justified a police stop of the car. While the relevant statute arguably did not prohibit tinted windows, the applicable administrative regulation prohibited tinted materials that did not meet certain standards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff maternal grandmother filed an application for visitation of defendant minor parents' child.

The court also ordered that a guardian ad litem be appointed at plaintiff's expense to represent the child's best interest. The court determined that it was in the child's best interest to have visitation with plaintiff. Further, the court held that plaintiff maintained the right to seek visitation. The court noted several contributing factors that favored visitation existed, including that both defendants were not yet emancipated and lived with both sets of parents, and that defendant mother could be ordered home with plaintiff due to her minority status.</SPAN></P>

R. 7:4-4(b), for permission to act as prosecutor with respect to the charge of defiant trespass in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C: 18-3b against defendant was denied by the municipal court. The private attorney represented generally the owner of an apartment complex where the alleged trespass occurred. On appeal, the court held that it was error for the municipal court to deny the application because there was no potential for an unfair conflict of interest in this case and reversed the municipal court's denial. The court held that a municipal judge should not adopt a flat rule for or against permitting private parties, represented or pro se, to prosecute. The decision was discretionary and should have been based on several factors, including the seriousness of the case, whether the municipal prosecutor consents to stand aside, the private attorney's actual conflict of interest, the degree of control exercised by the district attorney over the prosecution, and the involvement of the private attorney in a pending civil case arising out of the same facts as the criminal charge.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on the basis that plaintiff's cause of action was barred due to his failure to meet the statutory &quot;verbal threshold&quot; for serious injury to be eligible to sue for noneconomic loss. Plaintiff claimed that the portions of the &quot;deemer statute,&quot; N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:28-1.4, which applies the verbal tort threshold requirements to out of state drivers whose insurance companies are authorized to do business in New Jersey violated his constitutional rights under the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const.

The court granted defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment holding that &sect; 17:28-1.4 was not unconstitutional and that plaintiff was therefore &quot;deemed&quot; to have elected the verbal threshold. The court held that plaintiff failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact via objective, credible evidence that his alleged injuries fell within any of the nine categories set forth in N.J.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trust corporation sought a ruling from the court that defendant sheriff was not entitled to collect the statutory fee allowed him for conducting an execution sale, together with an order compelling the sheriff to deliver to the plaintiff his deed resulting from that execution sale, despite the non-payment of his fee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Final judgment in foreclosure in favor of plaintiff trust corporation was entered which provided for sale of a 376 unit residential apartment complex. A writ of execution was obtained and delivered to defendant sheriff and levy of the execution was made on the property. Plaintiff purchased the property at auction. Thereafter defendant advised plaintiff's counsel that the deed had been prepared and would be delivered upon payment of his fee. Plaintiff filed an action putting at issue the right of the sheriff to collect that fee. The demand for payment of the fee was restrained and the sheriff enjoined from readvertising the sale. Plaintiff argued that Congress had exempted it from the payment of any taxes, the sheriff's fee was in the nature of a tax, and therefore plaintiff was not required to pay it. The court held that the fact that plaintiff was liable for the sheriff's fee sprung from a series of decisions made by it and not from state action aimed at plaintiff. Under those circumstances the payment of the sheriff's fee was simply a cost in the furtherance of its business and was not a tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that plaintiff trust corporation had not established a cause of action and, accordingly, dissolved the restraint previously entered, directed plaintiff to pay defendant sheriff's fee and dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner newspaper applied for access to the records of the clerk of the superior court in an underlying domestic violence matter, and argued that the confidentiality provisions of the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:25-33, applied only to the statistical records maintained by the administrative office of the courts. The court disagreed, and held that the legislature intended to restrict the confidentiality of all records, as it had used the term &quot;this act,&quot; not &quot;this section,&quot; when it enacted the restrictions of the act. However, in analyzing whether a governmental interest was served in restricting access otherwise implicitly guaranteed under U.S. Const. amend. I, the court examined whether the release of the information would have a detrimental effect on the parties, particularly the victim, and, if so, whether it outweighed the public's interest of the right to know. The court granted the application because the parties had no opposition to the disclosure, the facts of the case were already a matter of public record, and, consequently, under the circumstances of this case, the release of the files would not discourage a victim from coming forward.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent of plaintiff surviving spouse of injured party filed suit against defendant asbestos manufacturer.

Plaintiff relied upon the tolling provisions of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-22 to preserve the action as timely. The court denied defendant's motion, holding that, although &sect; 2A:14-22 had been declared an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce in violation of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3, plaintiff could rely upon its provisions because the constitutionality ruling was not retroactive and plaintiff's reliance on the statute to toll her cause of action was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff sought to enjoin the enforcement of the statute and defendant was ordered to show cause why it should be permitted to impose the regulation. The court ruled in favor of plaintiff and permanently enjoined defendant from enforcing the statute. The court considered a three-prong test for determining whether the statute limited protected speech. The court concluded that the statute satisfied the content-neutrality prong of the time, place, and manner test, and that it left open alternative channels for circulation of the newspaper. However, the court held that the statute was an anti-littering law, which affected freedom of speech. The court determined that the anti-littering statute was overbroad because it interfered with freedom of speech and press. The anti-littering statute also interfered with free communication with U.S. Const. amend.

Ann. &sect; 13:17-1 et seq., to develop and promote certain land within a district. Plaintiff municipalities were located in such district and were required under the Act to contribute to an intermunicipal tax-sharing account pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:17-60. Plaintiffs contended that such section violated N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 and that federal law regulating wetlands development preempted the Act. The court rejected plaintiffs' allegations and upheld the Act and tax-sharing formula. The federal preemption alleged by plaintiffs was not significant because only a portion of the land within the district was subject to federal wetlands regulations. The court found that plaintiff's challenges to the tax-sharing provision was previously resolved in other cases, so that plaintiffs were barred by the doctrine of res judicata from relitigating the issues. The tax-sharing provision was found to be rational and was considered a cost of government. The court concluded that the formula was enacted within the legislature's power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that plaintiff municipalities' challenges to the tax-sharing formula established in the Hackensack Meadowlands Reclamation and Development Act were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The constitutionality of such formula had been previously upheld, and the Act was not preempted by federal regulation because only a portion of the land was a wetland.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs sought to permanently enjoin enforcement of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:11B-8(a) by defendants, state and officials. Section 34:11B-8(a) provided that an employer subject to its provisions was required to continue in effect an existing health benefit plan for an absent employee during an authorized period of family leave.

Plaintiffs and defendants, New Jersey Department of Insurance and insurance company, filed cross-motions for summary judgment for a declaration concerning the constitutionality of &sect; 39:6A-8 of the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:6A-1 et seq., which was commonly known as the no fault insurance law. The court held that &sect; 39:6A-8, which permitted insured persons the choice of &quot;threshold&quot; or &quot;non-threshold&quot; coverage for personal injury protection payments that controlled the cost of insurance, constituted an unconstitutional denial of equal protection under both U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.J. Const. art. 1, para. 1, as applied to plaintiffs, who neither owned automobiles nor resided with those persons who did. Utilizing the rational basis test, the court found that including plaintiffs in the &quot;threshold&quot; category under &sect; 39:6A-8 without affording them the opportunity of paying a fee to increase their coverage or exempting them from the same exceeded the bounds of rationality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was before the court for determination of damages where, prior to his retirement, the previous judge had reversed defendant zoning board's decision to deny plaintiff church a variance to erect a radio station, and ruled that plaintiff was deprived of its freedom of speech by defendant and was entitled to recover such damages as it was able to prove.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff church prevailed in a claim against defendant zoning board for a denial of a variance to erect a radio tower. The judge who decided the case retired prior to awarding damages, and the case went before the court to determine damages. Plaintiff introduced evidence of loss of profits, increased costs of erecting the station itself and certain other expenses largely attributable to prosecuting the zoning case. The court decided that the proper measure of damages was the loss in property value, and because it found no proof of any actual damages, entered judgment of nominal damages in the traditional amount of six cents. Recovery for consequential damages was barred because research failed to produce any case that awarded consequential damages to an institution under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 as the result of the arbitrary imposition of a zoning regulation or the denial of a variance. The threat of such damage claims would have a significant negative influence on zoning and planning decisions. There was no actual taking of a part of the property as a result of the variance denial. None of plaintiff's property was on the market or held for investment purposes.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, &sect; XX and Ordinance 15-13.6(b)8 of the borough's Revised General Ordinances, delegating decisionmaking powers to defendant that properly should reside in planning and zoning boards, violated the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), N.J.

Petitioner contended that his earlier foreign conviction stemmed from a constitutionally defective plea bargain. State argued that petitioner in a post-conviction proceeding could not collaterally attack issues that might be raised on direct appeal. The court held that because petitioner knowingly and voluntarily entered his plea on the Oklahoma conviction, his application to have the conviction declared unconstitutional should be made in Oklahoma. The court also held that the Oklahoma judgment remained valid therefore its use to enhance his later sentence was proper. The court stated that petitioner could properly seek post-conviction relief subsequent to a finding by the Oklahoma court that his earlier plea was invalid.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Defendant's request that his case be transferred to a federal court was properly denied because the municipal court had jurisdiction in cases concerning the violation of a state statute for conduct that occurred in the state. The municipal court properly denied defendant's request for an injunction to stop the clinic's activities because such was to be heard before a civil court. Defendant was not entitled to a jury trial because N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:1-4 distinguished crimes from petty disorderly persons offenses. Defendant exceeded constitutionally protected speech activities when he blocked the doorway to the clinic and unreasonably prevented entrance thereto. Thus, defendant did not have legal privilege exempting him from liability. The municipal court's evidentiary rulings were proper. Finally, the court held that defendant could not claim the affirmative defense of use of force for the protection of third persons, namely the patients' unborn fetuses, because he was not charged with an offense of which force was an essential element.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a judgment that the seat belt law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:3-76.2f, was unconstitutional. Defendant was found guilty of operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and making an unsafe lane change, thus meeting the secondary action requirement allowing officers to enforce the seat belt law following apprehension for another offense. The court reversed the decision that the seat belt law was unconstitutional and imposed the fine on defendant as the record and decision below indicated he was in violation of the statute beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that there was a rational relationship to the purpose for which the statute was passed because New Jersey had an obvious and long recognized interest in regulating the operation and use of motor vehicles, the law was intended to reduce the numbers of vehicular deaths and injuries, and judicial notice had been taken of seat belts' effectiveness. The court determined that the statute did not attempt to regulate a fundamental right because the right to choose how one wanted to travel on a highway was not in the same category as the right to have an abortion or purchase contraceptives.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1989 N.J. Laws 67 permitted the year-round operation of hotels, guest houses, rooming houses, and boarding houses situated in any municipality that bordered on the Atlantic Ocean in a county of the fifth or sixth class provided certain conditions were met. Plaintiff litigant filed an action that challenged the constitutionality of 1989 N.J. Laws 67, and asserted that it was special legislation that benefited the owner of one particular hotel. Both plaintiff and defendants, the state, guest house owners, and an association, filed motions for summary judgment. The court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment, holding that 1989 N.J. Laws 67 did not constitute improper special legislation, because the statute's purpose of increasing beach access in New Jersey was rationally advanced by ensuring the availability of places of accommodation in shore communities. The court held that the statute's restriction to those communities which have existing accommodations operating on both seasonal and year-round bases was a practical recognition of the fact that those communities have experience dealing with members of the public temporarily residing in their communities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time plaintiff mortgagors obtained loans from defendant mortgagees, the Secondary Mortgage Loan Act (Act), N.J.

Plaintiffs filed separate motions for summary judgment to declare their mortgages void and unenforceable. The court denied plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment, holding that the amendment to the Act applied retroactively to plaintiffs' mortgages. The court concluded that retroactive application of the amendment was consistent with legislative intent, that the amendment was curative and ameliorative, as it reflected the legislature's attempt to improve an existing statutory scheme and mitigate the penalty for a violation, that no unfairness and inequity would have resulted, and that retroactive application would not have produced a manifest injustice, as the parties were required to comply with the obligations they originally undertook.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued that the warrantless search of their property violated their right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. IV, and N.J. Const. art. I, para. 7. The court denied defendants' motion to suppress. Under the open fields exception to the warrant requirement, the inspector had the right to observe defendants' land from a neighbor's property. In addition, the searches were reasonable because the debris on defendants' land constituted a landfill under N.J. Stat.

When defendant completed the 12-hour requirement, the IDRC referred defendant to the county council on alcoholism where defendant was required to attend counseling and Alcoholics Anonymous. Defendant refused to comply with the remaining requirements and sought review of the sentence. After finding defendant's action had not been mooted by a withdrawal of the IDRC's non-compliance charge, the court reversed and found that the IDRC rules were nonexistent legally, and therefore, subjecting defendant to the rules violated due process. The court found that the IDRC rules were nonexistent legally because the rules had not been enacted pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:14B-1 et seq.

Defendants, Office of the Public Defender, its law guardian program, assistant deputy public defender, and law guardians, represented the children in child abuse and neglect proceedings.

The law guardian program and its law guardians had absolute immunity from suit as court officers exercising judicial functions. Appointed counsel had immunity from suit except for legal malpractice, conspiracy, or other intentional misconduct. They were &quot;public employees&quot; under the Tort Claims Act, N.J. Stat.

Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The court granted the motion, holding that the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred plaintiffs' claims, as the present complaints would require the court to relitigate issues already decided by courts of competent jurisdiction. The court held that defendant judges were absolutely immune from suit, because the acts of which plaintiffs complained were judicial acts and defendant judges had jurisdiction over the subject matter that was before them. Defendant quasi-officials were acting pursuant to court directives and therefore were absolutely immune from suit. The court held that the New Jersey Tort Claims Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59:1-1 et seq., provided sovereign immunity to defendant public employees, as they acted in good faith in the execution and enforcement of the law. The court held that defendants needed only to establish that their conduct was objectively reasonable, and plaintiffs' bare allegations of malice and negligence were insufficient to defeat defendants' motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation was charged with violating Dover, N.J., Code &sect; 105B-5.2(c), which prohibited noise between certain hours and on weekends. Plaintiff sought an injunction against defendant township to permanently enjoin defendant from interfering with the operation of plaintiff's construction equipment and to bar defendant from prosecuting the charge. On appeal, the court noted that the charge was for operating heavy construction equipment on a weekend. The court found that &sect; 105B-5.2(c) did not bar operation of equipment on the weekend. The court found that while defendant was entitled to a presumption of validity, defendant must also show by clear and convincing evidence why otherwise lawful business was prohibited. The court found that noise was a fact of modern life, and thus, defendant's burden before the lower court was to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that the noise generated by plaintiff's construction equipment was unreasonable or unnecessary under the circumstances. The court held that &sect; 105B-5.2(c) did not permit defendant to preclude any activity which merely made reasonable or ordinary noise.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant bid solicitor solicited bids for acquisition of polymers to be used in its pollution control facilities. Only manufactured products of the United States, wherever available, should be used in connection with the contract, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:11-18. Defendant bid solicitor awarded the contract to defendant bidder. Plaintiff bidder contended that it was entitled to the contract because it was the only bidder providing an American made product. The court held that &sect; 40A:11-18 was constitutional. The court found that a literal implementation of the statute would require local units to break down components of a product, perform an investigation into the origin of each part, and quantify each element to determine compliance. The court declared that a more flexible interpretation was reasonable. The court concluded that, in some circumstances, defendant bid solicitor had discretion to buy a foreign product even if an American product was available, but it must demonstrate that it acted reasonably. The court ordered a plenary hearing to determine whether defendant bid solicitor acted reasonably in awarding all three contracts to defendant bidder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, township and mayor, introduced an ordinance that would redesignate the area in which the properties of plaintiffs, corporation and property owners, were located to a preservation-reclamation zone. The ordinance permitted the continued operation of plaintiff corporation's present manufacturing facility but rendered it nonconforming. Defendant township contended that the ordinance was designed to promote the general welfare of the people. The court declared that defendant could simply invoke the term general welfare to sustain an act not truly grounded in the authority delegated to the municipality to regulate land use. The court found that the ordinance did not bear a real and substantial relationship to land use regulation. Thus, defendant township chose an impermissible means to accomplish its objective when it grounded its action in the zoning power. The court held that the ordinance was invalid and defendant township's effort to get action for the clean up of the property could not be grounded in the zoning power.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:84A-32.4. Considering the statute in light of a recent United States Supreme Court decision, the court held that, because the statute was not of a generalized nature, but rather required a specific case-by-case finding before its special protections were employed, and because any deprivation of a defendant's confrontation rights was minimal, the statute was constitutional. The state legislature was concerned with developing a statute which would adequately protect the rights of both defendants and child victims. The statute provided for only minimal intrusion upon a defendant's right to face-to-face confrontation of the witness. The court heard the testimony of psychological experts concerning the effect upon the victim of testifying in court, and the court ordered her evaluation by a psychiatrist. Based on all of the evidence, the court issued the order with specific details as to how it should be implemented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In four separate cases, argued together on appeal, defendants either sought review of municipal court (New Jersey) convictions for violations of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-50 (DWI) based on blood alcohol readings obtained using a breathalyzer machine, or sought interlocutory appeal seeking to admit testimony with regard to the administration of blood alcohol tests using a breathalyzer machine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants did not claim the breathalyzer was scientifically unreliable, rather, they claimed that the breathalyzer test given to them was not reliable without proof by the state that the machine was working properly and that the test was administered properly. On appeal, the court reversed the convictions of two defendants and found in defendants' favor on two interlocutory appeals concerning admissibility of expert opinion evidence regarding breathalyzer testing. The court found the breathalyzer design was based upon a fixed blood-breath ratio of 2100/1 while individual ratios range between 1100/1 and 3200/1, where test results obtained from individuals having a blood-breath ratio substantially more or less than 2100/1 could be substantially erroneous. Additional evidence pointed to other potential errors caused by blood and temperature variations in the human body and variations in the breathalyzer itself. The burden was on the state to show that defendant's blood-breath ration was other than 2100/1. The court remanded for expert testimony on the validity of the tests taken by defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the convictions of two defendants as the state agreed that breathalyzer results were subject to significant errors, with various factors affecting the test. Videotapes of defendants were inconsistent with the tests, raising reasonable doubt and invalidating the convictions. In the remaining two cases, the court remanded the matters to allow expert testimony concerning the validity of each defendant's test.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs corporations contended that the Paramus Sunday closing ordinance was unconstitutional, both facially and as applied, because it represented an unreasonable exercise of the police power and was discriminatory, resulting in a denial of equal protection and due process of law. Defendant, Borough of Paramus, argued that those issues were finally determined in favor of defendant and that nothing had occurred since then to alter, change or modify that decision. The basic issue here presented was whether the prohibition of the ordinance against computer usage on Sunday was a burden upon interstate commerce, commercial speech rights, and not rational. The court ruled that exercising its police power, a municipality could enact an ordinance that did restrict personal freedom and property rights and sometimes imposed burdens upon or affected interstate commerce where the burden was incidental. The court also ruled that computer speech was not commercial speech and that the ordinance had a rational basis. The court ruling in favor of plaintiffs held as a matter of law computer use on Sunday could be maintained pursuant to the ordinance as a work of necessity.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statutes were constitutional, except that it withheld judgment as to the constitutionality of that portion of &sect; 2C:35-12 which dealt with post-conviction agreements. The court held that &sect; 35-7 was not vague because it established clear guidelines which informed the public as to what was prohibited and instructed the police what was permitted; it was not overbroad because it did not punish lawful activity. The court held that the legislature had a legitimate and reasonable basis for the elimination of the mens rea requirement from &sect; 35-7 and that it could do so to achieve a proper legitimate purpose. The court held that &sect; 2C:35-12, did not violate the separation of powers because it did not compel the trial court to impose the sentence agreed upon and the ultimate sentence would still remain to be fixed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, school employee and husband, sought damages for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and loss of consortium related to a publication of the student newspaper and claimed that the article was not protected speech. The court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, college and others, on all counts. The court held that freedom of the press outweighed the individual interest in reputation, peace of mind, and freedom from emotional distress. The court held that given the context of the spoof insert that contained not one single serious article, the portions charged as defamatory could not have reasonably been understood as a statement of fact and therefore the ad was a protected expression of opinion. Since the article was determined not to be defamatory, the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress was not actionable as a matter of law. The court held that all the claims including loss of consortium failed as well, because they were based upon the same alleged improper conduct that the court determined was protected.</SPAN></P>

Defendants asserted that this requirement violated their U.S. Const. amend. V privilege against self-incrimination because it created a link to other crimes that defendants could and were in fact eventually charged with. The state contended that the &sect; 2C:17-6(b) requirement was voluntary and that no U.S. Const. amend. V question arose since the information was not compelled. The court disagreed and held that under &sect; 2C:17-6(b) defendants could only escape prosecution by supplying the information listed in the statute and that the disclosure of the information presented a realistic threat of prosecution for offenses other than that prohibited by &sect; 2C:17-6(b).

Plaintiff filed a lawsuit contending N.J. Stat. Ann. 43:17-1 through 43:17-47 regulating the local firemen's relief associations and the New Jersey State Firemen's Association were unconstitutional. The court held that the statutes challenged were subject to a reasonable and rational interpretation and the standards set out in the statutes were constitutionally sufficient.

The court set aside defendant's determination that plaintiff was ineligible for membership in or benefits from the Fort Lee and State Relief Association.

As a result, the ordinance lost its presumption of validity and the burden of persuasion shifted from the parties attacking the regulation to the party imposing the regulation.

The court denied defendant's motions to dismiss and suppress. The court held the searches were valid pursuant to N.J. Stat.

The court found that &sect; 58:10A-6(g) was constitutional because the scope of the entry was limited to reasonable times after the presentation of the inspector's credentials. The court noted defendant's operation of a slaughterhouse that produced biological waste placed defendant on notice that his premises could potentially be subject to inspection. The court found that the open fields exception was applicable because defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy where his land did not have a fence, he did not post privacy signs, and the land was in a rural location with an undefined boundary line.</SPAN></P>

The court held that plaintiff did not fall within the definition of a &quot;contracting unit&quot; as that expression was defined in the Local Public Contracts Law at N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;40A:11-2. Plaintiff was created by an act of the legislature, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12:11A-1, et seq., was not answerable to any county or municipality, and was the sole agency under N.J. Stat.

Thus, it was a &quot;state agency&quot; within the plain language of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:11-2 and the Law applied only to counties and municipalities. Further, plaintiff was financially independent of public funds, being essentially a revenue producing operation, and tax reserve fund was merely a device to funnel to taxing districts compensation for taxes lost by them due to plaintiff's tax-exempt status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs gravel pit owners filed an action against defendants, state and commission, claiming that a regulation, which permitted existing resource extraction activities to continue provided certain registrations or permits were obtained prior to the date plaintiffs applied for a permit, violated state and federal constitutional principals. Plaintiffs also contended that it was an arbitrary action, violated the Municipal Land Use Law, N. J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55D-1 et seq., and was invalid under the theory of estoppel. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The court held that the appellate court had exclusive jurisdiction over the issues raised by plaintiffs concerning civil rights damage claims as those claims were based upon the alleged unconstitutionality of the regulation and its procedural rules and actions. The court ruled that the complaint did not have to be dismissed. The issues raised by plaintiffs could have been raised in a previous restraining action because defendants' action against plaintiffs was settled before any responsive pleading was filed and no issues which were raised or could have been raised in that proceeding were argued to the court.</SPAN></P>

The plaintiffs provided a second mortgage on their home as security for the loan.

Thereafter, the plaintiffs instituted an action against the defendant and alleged violations of the Act. In dismissing the plaintiffs' complaint, the court explained that an obligation of a borrower arising out of a secondary mortgage loan shall be void and unenforceable unless the loan was executed in full compliance with the Act.

V and XIV and N.J. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1; and that 2C RICO was vague and overbroad because no one could tell what conduct was prohibited. The court denied defendants' motions holding that, when a State law was challenged as violating the federal commerce clause, the legislation had to discriminate against or otherwise unduly burden interstate commerce. The court found that 2C RICO went to the heart of the State's police powers, and it was not an exercise in economic protectionism. The court also found that the language of a statute was clear and unambiguous on its face and that there was no need to delve into the intent of the legislature to define the terms &quot;gambling,&quot; &quot;unlawful debt,&quot; and &quot;enterprise,&quot; because, as a remedial statute, 2C RICO sufficiently defined criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 2C:35-7 was not void for vagueness, either facially or as-applied, because the statute's language and application were clearly capable of comprehension. Finding that the state's exercise of police power under &sect; 2C:35-7 was predicated on the Act's goal of protecting children, as stated in N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This matter is before the court on the return date of an order to show cause on plaintiff business entity's application requiring defendant horse owner to show cause why an order should not be entered permitting plaintiff to proceed with the sale of defendant's horses pursuant to the Stableman's Lien Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:44-51, 52, for non-payment of boarding fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff business entity brought suit against defendant horse owner for non-payment of boarding fees, and sought to proceed with the sale of defendant's horses in order to recoup his losses pursuant to the Stableman's Lien Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:44-51, 52. Defendant argued that the Act violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it did not provide him with notice and a hearing prior to the deprivation of his property interest, in this case his horses. The court agreed that by its terms the Act constituted a constitutional violation for the reason asserted by defendant. However, the court applied the statute in conjunction with the procedural requirements of N.J. Ct. R. 4:52 pertaining to interlocutory relief. Therefore, the court ordered that prior to any sale by plaintiff under the Act, plaintiff had to proceed under Rule 4:52 by order to show cause, supported by verified complaint or affidavit. In addition, because there was a dispute over the amount owed, the court set a hearing dated on the return date of the order to show cause to determine the respective rights of the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court scheduled a hearing to show cause to determine the respective rights of plaintiff business entity and defendant horse owner because a bona fide dispute existed as to the amount due in connection with the dispute over defendant's non-payment of boarding fees and related matters.</SPAN></P>

The court held that plaintiff was not allowed to post no trespassing signs under the ordinance and that his effort to enforce the trespass law was restricted. The court held that the ordinance did not provide plaintiff with a no trespass remedy unless he personally witnessed the trespass and policed his own property. The court concluded that the ordinance violated the free speech guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. I and N.J. Const. art. I, par. 6 because plaintiff was entitled to fair comment on a matter of public interest. The court held that plaintiff's signs were designed to protect his property from intruders, the intruders affected the value of his property, and that the signs contained commercial speech that was constitutionally protected.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that joinder was proper because the state would use the same witnesses in the prosecution of both defendants.

The re-zoning then prohibited the building of churches or places of worship from a residential zone. Plaintiff filed suit against defendant arguing that defendant's actions were unconstitutional. The court held that defendant's total exclusion of churches from residential districts violated the guarantee of freedom of religion provided by the state constitution. The court held that defendant's relocation of plaintiff to a less desirable zone of the township because of the proposed size of plaintiff's facility violated N.J. Const. art. I, par. 3.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner purchased an isolated lot in Lacey Township (New Jersey), which was nonconforming. Pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55D-70(c)(1), plaintiff sought a zoning variance in order to construct a single-family residence on his lot. Defendant Lacey Township Board of Adjustment (New Jersey) denied the variance, finding that the failure to grant the variance would not create undue hardship and that it could not be granted without substantial detriment to the public good. The court held that a zoning variance applicant, inter alia, carried the burden of proof and must have demonstrated that efforts were made to bring the property into conformity by attempting to buy adjacent property and submitted plans for the proposed house that proved compliance with building codes. In all such cases, defendant was required, inter alia, to determine whether additional information was needed to supplement the record and to make specific findings of fact to support its conclusions. The court remanded the judgment, holding that defendant merely speculated on an inadequate record, as plaintiff failed to address the negative criteria, namely the possible detriment to the area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In issue were the best interests of a child conceived by defendant mother, a married woman, using the sperm of plaintiff father, a married man, pursuant to a surrogate-parenting agreement. Plaintiff father and his wife sought to enforce the surrogate-parenting agreement, compel defendants to surrender the infant child, restrain any interference with plaintiffs' custody, terminate defendants' parental rights and allow adoption of the child by plaintiff wife. The court found there was no fraud, legal or equitable, that would allow defendants to rescind their agreement. The surrogate-parenting agreement was a valid and enforceable contract pursuant to the laws of New Jersey. The rights of the parties to contract were constitutionally protected under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court further found that defendant mother had breached her contract in two ways: (1) by failing to surrender the child to plaintiffs, (2) by failing to renounce her parental rights to the child. The court found the child was a third-party beneficiary of the contract and specific performance was in her best interests. The court ordered specific performance of the contract and other relief requested by plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff father and his wife on the grounds that the best interests of the child required the specific enforcement of the surrogate-parenting agreement. The court made permanent a prior order of the court giving temporary custody to plaintiff father and vacated prior orders of visitation. The court terminated the parental rights of defendant mother and formally adjudged plaintiff the father.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff intended to move into the first-floor unit. Plaintiff's building contained three residential units and one commercial unit. The court dismissed the action because plaintiff did not have good cause to evict defendant under the Eviction for Good Cause Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:18.61(l)(3) . The court analyzed the statutory provision which provided good cause to evict if an owner of a building of three residential units or less sought to personally occupy a unit. The court held that this provision did not apply to plaintiff because his building contained four units, three residential and one commercial.

Plaintiff parents sought an injunction enjoining the enforcement of the ordinance after they were charged with curfew violations committed by their children. The court held that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, because it contained unnecessarily sweeping restrictions of fundamental personal liberties of children, such as their freedom of speech, assembly and religion. The court also held that the ordinance violated the equal protection rights of children, because there was no compelling interest in restricting the fundamental rights of minors by imposing a curfew upon them which did not affect adults. The court also held that the ordinance interfered with the rights of parents to have their children exercise their fundamental constitutional rights. The court did uphold language in the ordinance that created a rebuttable presumption, based on notice of a prior curfew violation, that parents had knowledge of a second violation.</SPAN></P>

The death of decedent resulted from an injury sustained while working for defendant. Plaintiff filed suit as the administrator of the estate. She also sought recovery as an individual for loss of consortium. Plaintiff sought recovery under the Wrongful Death Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:31-1 et seq., as surviving spouse. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment because plaintiff was never actually married to decedent in a formal or religious ceremony. The court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment because an unwed companion or live-in cohabitant had no right to recover damages for alleged loss of consortium or as a claimant under the Wrongful Death Act. A claim for loss of consortium had to be founded upon a marriage relationship. Because there was no marriage between plaintiff and decedent and there was no evidence of an intent to marry, plaintiff had no right to recover damages as an individual or for loss of consortium.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an agent for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (D.E.P.), appealed an order of a municipal court (New Jersey), which convicted her of criminal trespass in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:18-3(a). Defendant entered the business premises of complainant when he was not present to investigate a citizen complaint about pesticide drift; complainant operated a pesticide applicator licensed by the D.E.P.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal of her conviction for criminal trespass, defendant, a field agent for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (D.E.P.), contended that she was privileged to enter and inspect the complainant's business premises in his absence without a warrant, and to go through a closed desk drawer looking for information in connection with a citizen complaint about the drift from an aerial pesticide spraying performed by complainant's company, which was licensed by the D.E.P. The court held that defendant was not guilty of criminal trespass because the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt one of the elements of the offense, that defendant did not know that she was not acting pursuant to the privilege and authority she perceived she was granted under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1F-9(c), part of the Pesticide Control Act of 1971, and N.J. Admin. Code tit. 13, &sect; 30-1.7. The court further ruled that defendant's search was legal because the pesticide industry was subject to pervasive regulation, and therefore there was a diminished expectation of privacy and a right on the part of the government to enter licensees' premises without a warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant field agent's conviction for criminal trespass, finding that one of the elements of the offense was lacking in that the prosecution had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had entered business premises knowing that she was not privileged to do so. The court also held that defendant's search of the premises was legal under statutory and common law applicable to this pervasively regulated industry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state grand jury returned an indictment charging criminal defendants with promoting gambling and possession of gambling records. Defendants sought to suppress evidence and alleged that that the seizure of telephone toll records without a warrant violated defendants' constitutional privilege against unreasonable search and seizure. The court suppressed the evidence and the state filed a motion for reconsideration. The court held that , although the seizure of records of telephone calls without judicial sanction did not violate U.S. Const. amend. IV's prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure, New Jersey's Constitution provided a broader protection against the warrantless seizure of telephone toll records. In this case, New Jersey's standards made the original warrantless seizure improper, and admitting the records into evidence would validate a seizure undertaken contrary to the provisions of the New Jersey Constitution and thereby directly and significantly contravene the imperative of judicial integrity in upholding that Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the state's motion for reconsideration of the prior ruling suppressing the records from evidence on the basis that New Jersey's standards made the original warrantless seizure improper.</SPAN></P>

The court granted defendant's motion to dismiss concluding that &sect; 2C:64-8 governed and that plaintiff failed to file his action within three years after his gun was seized. The court relied upon the rules of statutory construction to determine that the statutory language filing a claim was intended to mean the filing of a civil action.

The court held that defendant's random procedure of mandatory urinalysis testing was not permissible under the search and seizure provisions of N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, and U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court held that urine testing did not require a showing of probable cause, but merely a reasonable suspicion to believe that a sheriff's department officer was unlawfully using controlled substances. The court stated that to satisfy this standard, the correction officials were required to point to specific objective facts supportive of the testing and rational inferences drawn therefrom. The court modified a preliminary order to restrain defendant from testing two of the plaintiff officers, for which no facts supporting the testing were presented, but ordered that the testing of two other plaintiffs could proceed based upon objective facts supporting a reasonable suspicion of the use of controlled substances.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that conditional discharges should not have been longer than 90 days under N.J. Ct. R. 4:74-7(f) without a hearing and that procedures should have been in place in the event plaintiff violated her conditional discharge. The court found that in plaintiff's case, her case manager should have taken her to a crisis center and a doctor should have examined her. If an examining doctor had certified that it was necessary to reconfine plaintiff because she had become dangerous, the caseworker should have notified plaintiff's public advocate and the court of the situation and the doctor's opinion, by telephone, if necessary.

One sought to prevent the operation of motor vehicles by those whose faculties were so impaired as to present a danger to the safety of others and themselves. The other sought to suppress illegal traffic in narcotic drugs. Further, while &sect; 39:4-49.1 carried a mandatory two-year loss of driving privileges, there was no term of imprisonment provided as there was for &sect; 39:4-50(a). The court held that &sect; 39:4-49.1 was constitutional, that there was a rational legitimate purpose for the legislative enactment, and that there was no cruel and unusual punishment under either U.S. Const. amend VIII or N.

In response, defendant filed an answer and counterclaim, asserting the court was the forum for adjudication of plaintiff's access claim. At the time, the access claim was proceeding on an administrative track. Subsequently, defendant filed a motion seeking an order enjoining plaintiff from pursuing its access claim under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:5A-49, and N.J. Admin. Code tit. 14, &sect; 18-3.10. Soon after, defendant filed a third-party complaint against third-party defendant board, seeking to enjoin it from acting on plaintiff's access petition. Defendant board answered and filed a motion to dismiss the third-party complaint for lack of jurisdiction. During the oral arguments on the motions, association sought to intervene. After oral argument, the court denied defendant developer's request for an injunction and granted defendant board's motion to dismiss the third-party complaint because jurisdiction was lacking. The court also granted intervenor association's motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant municipality passed an ordinance which prohibited news racks on public sidewalks. Plaintiff newspaper applied for a preliminary injunction to restrain defendant from removing its news racks and sought to declare defendant's ordinance unconstitutional under the U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV and the New Jersey Constitution. On review, the court found that the ordinance was an invalid prior restraint as there were no standards that controlled the discretion of the mayor and council in granting or denying a permit to newspapers such as plaintiff. However, the court found that the limitations in the ordinance were reasonably related to the interest of defendant's community and were appropriate in that the purpose of the regulation was to see that property was kept orderly and there was a need of safety for persons exiting from the street, as well as aesthetic reasons. The court also found that there were reasonable alternative means available for plaintiff to continue to distribute newspapers by moving the news racks elsewhere. The court concluded that only the provisions which were found to be invalid were stricken and, otherwise, the ordinance was upheld.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the drug testing policy violated the students' U.S. Const. amend. IV right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. The court held that blanket drug testing was not based on a reasonable suspicion that the search would turn up evidence that the student had violated or was violating the law. The court held that the drug testing was not reasonably related to the objectives of the search and was excessively intrusive in light of the age of the students. The court also held the drug testing violated the students' due process rights. The court held that the students were entitled to due process guaranteed by the U.S. Const. amend.

No reasonable interpretation of the amendment allowed an efficient landlord to realize a fair and reasonable rate of return in cases where the board finds it is necessary to grant a hardship increase in excess of the statutory limit. As such the ordinance's limitation on annual increases amounted to an arbitrary or discriminatory act of legislative power and the court declared it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Teaneck, NJ, Code &sect; 26-22.1 et seq. (1973). The code mandated homeowner approval before canvassing by requiring a listing of the specific blocks to be canvassed and by limiting such listings to no more than one every six months. The court held that state law did not preempt the code because the code was not an obstacle to implementation of state law. The court held that the speech complained of was commercial speech. Because it was not false or deceptive and did not concern unlawful activities, the court held that it could be restricted only in the service of a substantial governmental interest and only through means that directly advanced that interest. The court held that the code served a substantial governmental interest, but that it was too broad and restrictive. The court held that the code could not mandate homeowner approval, but that the code could require notice as to who was conducting canvassing campaigns and the time frames within which they would occur.</SPAN></P>

Several plaintiffs called the constitutionality of the act into question. The court held the act to be constitutional, holding that the court was not required to transfer all pending cases to the council, thereby possibly prolonging the litigation; rather, the act gave the court discretion to do so in certain cases while mandating transfer when the litigation had only just started. The court did not determine if the act unconstitutionally limited judicial remedies because the issue was not ripe; even if the provision was unconstitutional, it was severable from the rest of the statute. The court found the housing regions as defined in the act to be consistent with constitutional requirements. The court also declined to decide other challenges, leaving the council to make rules consistent with the constitution when implementing the act.</SPAN></P>

Although the legislature had given a future effective date to the statute, it noted, it found no other evidence of legislative intent to have the statute apply prospectively. It held that in enacting the statute, the legislature intended to correct the situation where persons entitled to PIP benefits were delayed in receiving them because of disputes between co-equal insurers, making the statute remedial in nature and thus entitled to retroactive effect.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowner sought review of an order of defendant municipal bodies (New Jersey), which denied plaintiff's application for a use variance to permit religious services in his home in violation of Borough of Deal, N.J., Ordinance &sect;&sect; 18-6.2 (1967), 18-69 (1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By permitting religious services in his home, plaintiff homeowner violated Borough of Deal, N.J., Ordinance &sect;&sect; 18-6.2 (1967), 18-69 (1984), which excluded houses of worship. Plaintiff was issued a summons, and he applied for a use variance, which was denied by defendant municipal bodies. The court held that the municipal zoning ordinances violated N.J. Const. art. I, para. 3 and its guaranteed protections of the free exercise of religion. The ordinances were unduly burdensome, failed to select the least restrictive means to accommodate plaintiff's right to freely exercise his religion, and failed to demonstrate any governmental interest which could have arguably been classified as overriding. The guaranty of freedom of worship as set forth by the state constitution foreclosed any use by defendants of their zoning power to prohibit the free exercise of religious activity in the privacy of one's home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that plaintiff homeowner was not in violation of municipal zoning ordinances that excluded houses of worship because the ordinances violated state constitutional protections for the free exercise of religion. Thus, plaintiff's home-based religious services did not transgress the overly burdensome ordinances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former police officer brought an action against defendant municipality to recover compensation for overtime work plaintiff performed. Plaintiff's claim was based on the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 201 et seq., the New Jersey State Wage and Hour Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:11-56a et seq., and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:14-133, which provided that no police officer shall be required to work more than six days in any one week.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time that plaintiff former police officer's action for overtime compensation against defendant municipality was tried, the governing law established that the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 201 et seq., did not apply to state and local governments. The court held that subsequent case law declaring that the FLSA was applicable to local governments could not be retroactively applied to plaintiff's case because defendant relied on the prior law and a retroactive application would have a substantial and inequitable impact on defendant's finances. The court held that plaintiff was not entitled to any recovery against defendant because the New Jersey State Wage and Hour Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:11-56a et seq., was a general statute which yielded to the set of specific statutes that dealt with municipal police departments. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:14-133 governed a police officer's days of employment, but it did not create a private right of action for overtime compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that plaintiff former police officer was not entitled to overtime compensation because defendant municipality properly relied on prior law declaring that the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act did not apply to local governments, the New Jersey State Wage and Hour Law did not apply to the employment relationship between the parties, and the applicable state law had been construed to deny policemen's claims for overtime compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant buyers agreed to purchase a single family home from plaintiff sellers. The agreement consisted of a printed form prepared by plaintiff broker. The agreement required plaintiff sellers to pay a commission to plaintiff broker and to plaintiff cooperating broker. The agreement also contained a clause that defendants interpreted as permitting cancellation of agreement if an appraisal showed the property was worth less than the purchase price. Defendants cancelled the agreement in reliance on this clause when they received an appraisal reflecting a value of less than the purchase price. Plaintiff sellers then sued defendants for the amount of their deposit as liquidated damages alleging defendants did not make settlement in accordance with the agreement terms. Plaintiff brokers brought separate suits against defendants for the recovery of their commissions. Defendants counterclaimed for both compensatory and punitive damages and return of deposit. All parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment because the mortgage contingency clause and the form language violated the Plain Language Act, N. J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three persons were elected to township's council in a municipality's general election. The municipality contained nineteen districts. After a recount ordered pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:28-1 et seq., the election was completed. Petitioner was defeated for the third seat on the council by only fourteen votes and filed a petition contesting the election pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:29-2. Several democrat candidates immediately filed a counter-petition contesting the election of all of the republican candidates. At the trial of the contest, numerous legal voters testified that they had been rejected at the polls. Rejections resulted from the breakdown of a single voting machine. During the time that the machine was inoperative more than fourteen legal voters left the polling place without voting. The trial court concluded that the fourteen rejected voters were a sufficient number to change the result, thus the election was set aside. The reviewing court held that a special election in that district was required in order to fill the council seat vacancy because the election contest was subject to the exercise of judicial power based on the aura of uncertainty and unfairness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court held that a special election was required in order to fill the third seat of the township's council because the evidence supported a finding that sufficient numbers of legal voters were prevented from voting for reasons beyond their control so as to create the potential for a different result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first-degree murder. At the time of the murder, defendant was a juvenile. Jurisdiction was waived by the juvenile court pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A: 4-48. Defendant's appeal of the waiver order was denied. The grand jury returned an indictment charging him with purposeful or knowing murder by his own conduct, felony murder, first-degree robbery, and third-degree unlawful possession of a weapon. The state served defendant with notice of an aggravating factor in order to invoke the capital sentencing procedures of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3c. Defendant moved to strike the application, arguing that the death penalty as applied to a juvenile violated the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Defendant served the state with a subpoena duces tecum demanding that the state provide him with guidelines as to how homicide cases were selected for capital treatment. The state moved to quash defendant's subpoena duces tecum. The appellate court refused to strike the state's application of N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court refused to strike the state's application to invoke capital sentencing procedures as to defendant's first-degree murder charge because the court rejected defendant's assertion that society did not favor capital punishment of juvenile offenders. However, the state was ordered to submit capital case selection guidelines to review for abuse. The remainder of defendant's subpoena duces tecum was quashed pending review.</SPAN></P>

The fetus' guardian filed suit seeking a declaration that the woman was incompetent in the sense that she could not manage her affairs and seeking the appointment of a guardian for the woman. The woman was discharged from the psychiatric hospital and admitted her pregnancy. The woman moved for dismissal of the incompetency action, challenged the right of the fetus to be represented, and challenged the standing of the fetus' guardian to file the incompetency complaint. The court held that the appointment of the guardian was improper and that the fetus' guardian had no standing to institute any action. The fetus was not a person and privacy issues were involved because the woman was in her first trimester of pregnancy. The fetus' guardian did not have standing to bring incompetency proceedings because he was a mere stranger to the action.

Plaintiffs prevailed in the underlying action that challenged local improvement assessments by defendants, township council and town. The court reviewed the matter to determine whether plaintiffs were entitled to fees and costs under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, even though the Civil Rights Act was not the basis of the successful claim. Plaintiffs had pleaded a violation of the principles of due process, but the court decided the matter on other grounds. The court granted plaintiff's motion and determined that there were constitutional grounds for liability. The court held that local assessments should be equivalent to benefits, and that defendant's assessments were constitutionally invalid because they violated defendants' police power in that they arbitrarily exceeded their benefits. The assessments violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV because they deprived plaintiffs of property without due process. The court held that the award of fees and expenses was proper even though plaintiff's had prevailed on the non-fee claim.</SPAN></P>

Defendant became involved in the manufacture of asbestos-containing products when it merged with its predecessor in 1972, and continued to manufacture asbestos-containing cement until 1977. Plaintiff victims of asbestos exposure were employed by defendant's predecessor. Defendant became statutorily bound to absorb all liabilities of its predecessor upon merger. As such, plaintiffs filed tort claims against defendant and requested compensatory and punitive damages. Defendant filed a motion for partial summary judgment, seeking to dismiss the punitive damage claims. The court denied defendant 's motion and held that the continuation test was applicable to determine a successor's liability for punitive damages. It held that the test assisted in striking a fair balance between an individual's recovery and a corporation's liability in situations where the actual wrongdoer no longer existed and the successor was sufficiently connected to the culpable conduct. The court held that there were genuine issues of fact as to whether defendant was culpable and subject to punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff builders associations challenged the validity of defendant township's off-tract improvement ordinance, Bernards Township, N.J., Ordinance no. 672, which established a program to determine the amount which had to be paid by a developer for off-tract improvements as a condition of preliminary subdivision or site plan approval. Plaintiff alleged that the program was not authorized by the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), and was ultra vires. The court held that, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55D-42, the relationship between the development and the improvement had to be clear, direct, and substantial before an off-tract improvement could be required. As the ordinance was based on the premise that all future development would have impacted all of defendant's roads without regard to the location or particular characteristics of each development, its allocation of future improvement costs did not rest on a clear, direct, and substantial relationship between a particular development and the improvement. The court therefore found the ordinance to be beyond the authority of the MLUL and ultra vires.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city sought to remove all coin-operated news vending machines, known as honor boxes, located on city rights-of-way, which were owned by plaintiff newspaper publishers and intervenor newspaper publishers. Plaintiffs filed an action challenging defendant's right to require the removal. The court held that the protection of U.S. Const. amend. I extended to the sale of newspapers through honor boxes. Defendant sought to apply a random selection of municipal ordinances and zoning laws directed at various types of signs, vending machines, and handbill litter. The court found that honor boxes were not within the ambit of the ordinances. Defendant's approach was not a reasonable time, place, or manner regulation that was narrowly tailored to accomplish a legitimate governmental objective, but rather it was an unreasonable attempt at regulation, overbroad in its application. Thus, the court held that the ordinances were unconstitutional as applied to prohibit all honor boxes in public areas in the city. The court held that although N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27:5-1 could be interpreted to regulate honor box locations, as applied to defendant's attempt at total prohibition, it failed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 percent or more, without any other evidence, was insufficient to compel a conviction under &sect; 39:4-50(a). Defendant also argued that &sect; 39:4-50(a) was unconstitutional. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that if defendant operated a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 percent or more, he was guilty, no matter how the alcohol affected him personally. No other evidence was necessary to convict. There was no reason why defendant, who was a person of ordinary intelligence, would have had any difficulty in understanding &sect; 39:4-50(a). The court concluded that the breathalyzer was in proper working condition, that the tests were properly administered, and that the blood alcohol readings were very high. Under these circumstances the extrinsic evidence did not create any doubt that defendant's blood alcohol concentration was 0.10 percent or more at the time he was operating a motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, casinos and association, challenged the constitutionality of L. 1984, c. 67, which set aside the court's prior order enforcing defendant county board of taxation's order directing defendant city to revalue its land for property tax assessment purposes. Chapter 67 effectively set aside the court's judgment and authorized defendant city to decide whether to revalue its land for the 1984 tax year. Plaintiffs argued that c. 67 was an unconstitutional interference by the legislature with the court and that L. 1984, c. 67, &sect; 2 improperly delegated authority to the executive branch. The court sustained plaintiffs' challenge and held that c. 67 was unconstitutional. The legislature had improperly interfered with the court because c. 67 affected the result of a judicial proceeding in which a final judgment had been entered, thus usurping the judiciary's function. The court also ruled that c. 67, &sect; 2 improperly delegated authority to the executive branch because there was no standard for the exercise of authority. However, plaintiffs were not entitled to a restoration of the status quo ante, and c. 67 was to be given only prospective effect.</SPAN></P>

Nevertheless, plaintiffs were not entitled to a restoration of the status quo ante, and the statute could be given prospective effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a mayor and township, denied plaintiff arcade owner's application for additional video games and passed an ordinance that required certain video arcades to employ an off-duty police officer as security guard during certain hours of operation. The court held that the denial of plaintiff's application was arbitrary and unreasonable, and thus unlawful, as it was based primarily on testimony that bicycle thefts had occurred outside of the arcade where three other stores shared the premises. The fact that no problems inside, and no disturbances attributed to the arcade, had been reported was evidence that plaintiff maintained good and safe conduct at the premises. The ordinance requiring the employment of an attendant was a reasonable and substantially connected to advancing the public interest of protection of arcade patrons. However, there was no valid reason to require that the attendant be an off-duty police officer. It was overly restrictive, as anyone trained in security could ensure the safety of arcade patrons and the public. This section of the ordinance was stricken as invalid and unlawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the denial of plaintiff arcade owner's application was arbitrary and unreasonable, as it was not supported by sufficient evidence. The ordinance that required that a security guard be employed for certain arcades was a reasonable measure to protect the public interest, but there was no rational basis for requiring that the guard be an off-duty police officer.</SPAN></P>

The court held that P.L. 1982, c. 220 was special legislation in violation of N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, par. 2. The court found no rational relationship between the objects of the legislation, to alleviate the housing shortage, and the restriction of the tax exemption to a specific class, the one-family owned residential dwellings. The vice in the single-family home classification was that it created an inequality, a preference. It favored a portion of a class on the basis of the form of ownership in which the property was held. It excluded from the favored class other properties, which were similar and perhaps identical to the one-family group in all respects and which, but for the statutory preference, would be naturally included in the class, all in derogation of the legislative objective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant sports and exposition authority's motion for summary judgment in an action brought by plaintiff corporation and held that the action fell within Tort Claims Act, N.J.

The court rejected plaintiff's assertion that this was not a tort action subject to the limitations periods, but a statutory cause of action. The court, noting that there was no precise definition of a tort, held that based on the broad relief sought by plaintiff, this was the type of action that the legislature intended to include within the Tort Claims Act.

Defendants appealed their convictions and the court reversed, ordering that verdicts of not guilty be entered in each case. The court found that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad because it virtually precluded defendants from possessing many physical objects that were designed for lawful purposes, but which could, if improperly used, be classified as a weapon. The court held that, in prohibiting the possession of non-per se weapons without a consideration of exculpatory circumstances, including the purpose of possession of the weapon and the circumstances under which it was possessed, the former-felon possession statute was capable of arbitrary enforcement and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Capital defendant filed a motion to dismiss the murder indictment against him and to strike the aggravating factors. Defendant was indicted on one count of a knowing or purposeful murder contrary to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3(a)(1) or (2), and one count of possession of a handgun with purpose to use it against another contrary to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:39-4(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who shot and killed a man, was indicted for murder and possession of a handgun. The state later decided the case qualified as a capital offense and served notice of the aggravating factor pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3(c)(4)(b). In a motion to dismiss the indictment and strike the aggravating factor, defendant contended &sect; 2C:11-3 violated both the state and federal constitutions in that, inter alia, it permitted a form of cruel and unusual punishment and violated his rights to due process and equal protection. In denying the motion, the court held that New Jersey's death penalty statute provided a facially constitutional sentencing scheme and that &sect; 2C:11-3 did not violate federal constitutional law with regard to assignment of the burden of proof, The court found the defendant exhibited a knowing or purposeful state of mind regarding the creation of a great risk of death to another person sufficient to justify the imposition of the aggravating factor. While the notice as to the death penalty and aggravating factor was untimely, defendant's counsel was left with adequate time to prepare an insanity defense in the court's view.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment and to strike the aggravating factor and remove the death penalty, finding the statute in question was constitutional. While determining that the prosecutor's notice of intent to seek the death penalty and the aggravating factor was not timely failed, the court ordered that the notice be treated as if a motion to enlarge the time and been filed, and granted the motion nunc pro tunc.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff claimed that P.L. 1983, c. 350, was unconstitutional. The court agreed, holding the statute, except for &sect; 1, unconstitutional. The court found that the statute violated the Full Faith and Credit Clause, U. S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1, where it shifted the burden of proving jurisdiction to the party seeking enforcement; where it denied enforcement of the judgment, if the underlying claim had not been brought in Pennsylvania within New Jersey's statute of limitations; and where it denied enforcement of assessed penalties. The court also found that the statute violated the federal and state Equal Protection Clauses, U. S. Const. amend. XIV and N. J. Const. art.

The court found that the scholarships were not paid from public funds raised through taxation, that it was not plaintiff's decision to restrict the award of the scholarships to students with an intention of studying for the ministry, and that plaintiff did not sponsor or fund the scholarships.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, boards of health and two municipalities, filed an action against defendant landfill and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). Plaintiffs charged defendant landfill with violations of The Solid Waste Management Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1E-1 et seq., for which they sought to have penalties imposed. The alleged violations consisted of failure to cover the landfill, permitting noxious odors to escape, operating without the submission of permeability tests, and various related offenses. Information had been obtained by plaintiffs from inspection reports and other data compiled by defendant DEP, which plaintiffs also named in the complaint for failing to take action on the violations. Defendant DEP filed a cross-claim to enforce the penalties. The court concluded that both plaintiff municipalities had standing to complain because they were both affected by defendant landfill's practices. The court denied defendant landfill's motion to dismiss, but granted that of defendant DEP, finding it had complied with its duty to pursue the violations against defendant landfill by filing its cross-claim, and thus the court was without further jurisdiction over defendant DEP.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was twice previously convicted of violating the same statute, and on this motion he attacked the provisions relating to third and subsequent offenders. The court denied defendant's motion, rejecting his argument that the third offender provisions of &sect; 39:4-50 were unconstitutionally vague because they failed to state any maximum punishment failed. The court held that the legislative history demonstrated that the actual intent was not to authorize a maximum above 180 days. Rather, the legislature prescribed a mandatory sentence of 180 days, subject to credits by virtue of community service. The court held that 1982 N.J.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mortgage assignee, defendant state, and defendant city filed cross motions for summary judgment for the determination of the priority of plaintiff's mortgage lien, defendant state's lien under the Spill Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 58:10-23.11f(f), and defendant city's lien for real estate taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff mortgage assignee's foreclosure action against defendant state and defendant city, the parties filed motions for summary judgment. Defendant state argued that its lien under the Spill Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 58:10-23.11f(f) for the costs of clearing the premises of toxic waste was paramount to defendant city's lien for real estate taxes and plaintiff's interests. The court entered a judgment for defendant state, holding that defendant state's lien had priority over defendant city's and plaintiff's liens. Contrary to plaintiff's argument, &sect; 58:10-23.11f(f) was not an unconstitutional impairment of contract because plaintiff acquired his rights after the effective date of the statute. Further, the statute was a valid exercise of the police power to abate dangerous conditions. The premises had become a nuisance and contained substances declared hazardous and toxic under the Act. Finally, the court rejected plaintiff's argument that the Act was invalid because he was not provided with notice and an opportunity to be heard before subordination of his lien, explaining that no notice was required to lien holders before the abatement occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a judgment for defendant state, concluding that defendant state's lien for costs to clean up toxic waste had priority over defendant city's lien for real estate taxes and plaintiff mortgage assignee's lien. The statute under which defendant state's lien arose was not an impairment of plaintiff's contract rights but was a valid exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>

The court found defendants' constitutional and other arguments unpersuasive. The referenda would be subordinate to the special law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted for murder. The state claimed that N.J. Stat.

The trial court denied the motion, finding that the statutory aggravating factor was not unconstitutional. The court found that N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:11-3(c)(4)(c) was substantially identical to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 27-2534.1(b)(7), which was considered in two U.S. Supreme Court cases and held to be constitutional. The court found that the New Jersey Legislature was clearly aware of the issues of concern to the U.S. Supreme Court when it adopted the statute. In adopting the very language of the Georgia provision, the court found that the New Jersey Legislature was also adopting the interpretation of that language already accepted by the U.S. Supreme Court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After pleading guilty to credit card theft, defendant was placed on probation for one year, a condition of which was that he serve the first six months in jail. After his release from jail, but while still under active probation supervision, defendant unlawfully possessed LSD. Defendant was sentenced to 18 months in jail for the probation violation. Defendant appealed the sentence, arguing that it amounted to multiple punishment for the credit card theft conviction in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V. The court reviewed the sentencing framework of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-2, N.J. Stat. &sect; 2C:45-1(c), and N.J. Stat. &sect; 2C:45-3(b), and held it was constitutional. The court held that a custodial sentence, with appropriate credit for time served, could be imposed on defendant for a violation of probation even though the custodial condition of that probationary sentence had been fully served by defendant. This did not constitute double jeopardy because defendant knew, at the time he was sentenced to probation, that upon violation he faced whatever maximum custodial sentence could have been imposed originally.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's license application to provide video games at an arcade in a highway commercial zone was denied after defendant township adopted an 18 month moratorium ordinance on licenses for mechanical amusement devices. Plaintiff contended that the moratorium under an ordinance was unconstitutional and void as applied to his application, because it was an unlawful exercise of municipal police power. The court disagreed. The court did not require, as defendant sought, for plaintiff to exhaust his administrative remedies to obtain a ruling. However, the court held that plaintiff was required to await the outcome of the moratorium. The court found that video games were permitted uses in highway commercial areas, and the general licensing ordinance was valid, but the moratorium was also valid. The court concluded that an increased licensing fee could be charged for a single machine, but it held that fees totaling $ 5250 for 35 machines in the same location were excessive for the first year and thus invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant municipality passed ordinances which provided for the improvement of various streets that abutted plaintiff property owners' properties. Upon completion of such improvements, each parcel of real estate affected was assessed. The property owner's that did not pay assessments in full were subject to a percentage of interest, 8 percent under $ 1,500 and 18 percent over $ 1,500. Plaintiffs brought suit challenging the amount of legal interest be charged on installment payments of assessments. They contended since defendant was authorized under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:56-35 to charge such interest it was limited to legal interest which N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31:1-1 provided was 6 percent and that because defendant paid interest at 9 percent a year on bonds, that was the maximum interest rate allowed. The court found that the circumstances under which plaintiffs were assessed interest was controlled by &sect; 40:56-35 where defendant provided payments could be made in installments. The rate of legal interest was therefore determined by that statute, which was anything under 9 percent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that defendant municipality was allowed to charge interest at the rate of 9 percent a year on the assessments paid in installments as authorized by statute.

Plaintiff's brother sought to quash subpoena alleging that the information sought may be irrelevant and immaterial and was confidential, corporate and financial information. Plaintiff's brother further alleged their differences in running company's negated compensability and his status as a defendant in another action concerning his company enjoined him from disclosure. The court found the brother's case did not preclude such discovery and that a non-party could be deposed where information was relevant to case. However, the court concluded that the information sought was speculative, not essential to the case, and that the brother's right to privacy in personal financial affairs and confidential business information far outweighed the necessity of disclosure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55:14A, an earlier version of plaintiff committee adopted Town of Edgewater Park, N.J., Ordinance 2-81 creating defendant housing authority. However, statutory amendments that changed membership requirements were overlooked and Town of Edgewater Park, N.J., Ordinance 15-81 had to be enacted. The parties disagreed as to when memberships commenced and expired, and plaintiff sought a judgment that both ordinances were legally defective. The trial court held that Ordinance 2-81 created defendant because that was plaintiff's obvious intention. The statutory language regarding membership was automatically applied, it was unnecessary to repeat the language in the ordinance, and the erroneous provision was severable. Thus, Ordinance 15-81 was ineffective and, due to violations of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:49-2, was also invalid. Memberships were measured from the date of appointment. Although missing some appointees, defendant was authorized to act because a statutory quorum was present. Defendant's attorney fees were not recoverable on a quantum meruit basis because it had not ratified its employment of counsel as required by law.</SPAN></P>

A second version of the ordinance was unnecessary and also invalid due to plaintiff's failure to follow mandated statutory procedures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school districts brought an action against defendant government officials challenging a resolution of the legislature that reduced the minimum state aid to local school districts. Plaintiffs contended that the reduction violated the state constitution's thorough and efficient education requirement, N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; IV, par. 1, the equal protection clause of the state constitution, and U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court granted summary judgment for defendants, finding that the imposition of the reduction on the wealthiest school districts in the state did not violate the constitution. On the contrary, the court concluded that the reduction was constitutionally much less suspect than a reduction indiscriminately imposed upon all the school districts in the state, including the poorest. Additionally, the court found that the state constitution required a balanced budget and, when expenditure cuts were necessary to achieve a balanced budget, the state constitution assigned the basic responsibility to the legislature and the governor. The court concluded that only rarely did the judiciary have any proper constitutional role in making budget allocations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was charged with possession of narcotics with intent to distribute, and possession of a knife, and applied for admission to the Pretrial Intervention Program (PTI). His application was denied, despite the fact that defendant successfully had the evidence suppressed as the product of an unreasonable search and seizure. Defendant argued that evidence which was suppressed was improperly considered by the Pretrial Intervention Director in evaluating his application for admission to the program. The court overruled defendant's point of error, and concluded that the exclusionary rule did not bar the Pretrial Intervention Director from considering illegally seized evidence when evaluating his application. On balancing competing considerations, the court found that there was a minimal deterrent effect by extending the exclusionary rule to PTI proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the Pretrial Intervention Director, which denied defendant's application for admission to the Pretrial Intervention Program (PTI), and held that the exclusionary rule did not bar the Pretrial Intervention Director from considering illegally seized evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant mother sought review of an order from the trial court (New Jersey) denying her request to bar plaintiff husband from introducing any and all evidence based on defendant's communications with two marriage counselors, as provided by the marriage counselor's privilege under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:8B-29, in an underlying custody dispute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father applied for custody of his minor child after defendant mother removed her from the state. Plaintiff alleged defendant's abuse of the child, and attached to his application letters from two psychiatrists who had been the couple's marriage counselors prior to their breakup. After further proceedings, defendant moved to bar plaintiff from introducing the letters pursuant to the marital counselor's privilege under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:8B-29 and any evidence or any party who had seen the letters. The lower court denied the request, and defendant appealed. The court found that the minor child was a person protected by the federal and state constitutions. The court found that the purpose of the marital counselor's privilege was to encourage couples to seek qualified help in times of marital difficulty, however, the best interests of the child was of paramount importance. Any rational basis for asserting the privilege was overridden by the child's interest in having all relevant material introduced to determine what custodial arrangement was best for her. The court found that in the child custody context, &sect; 45:8B-29 was unconstitutional. The order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The marital counselor's privilege was unconstitutional in the child custody context. The best interest of the child outweighed the state's interest in fostering marital rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state senator sought dismissal of several charges contained in a multi-count indictment. The indictment alleged that defendant failed to report certain income in financial disclosure statements and that the failure to disclose such income was a violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:28-7, which proscribed the making of a false entry in any record or document received or kept by the government for information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state senator argued that legislature reserved to itself the authority to punish members who violate the conflicts of interest law. Defendant further argued that the remedies for such transgressions set forth in the statutory scheme were exclusive even in instances where the member's conduct plainly fell within the purview of a criminal statute. The court rejected defendant's arguments and denied his motion to dismiss the indictment, finding that such a position is contrary to public policy and that the power of the legislature to enforce its own rules does not divest the executive branch of the authority and obligation to prosecute criminal conduct. The common sense of the situation would make it crystal clear that documents received by or kept by the government include the financial disclosure forms at issue and there is no violation of the separation of powers doctrine. The court found that there was no violation of the speech and debate clause of the state constitution, as the submission of a financial disclosure document does not constitute a part of the legislative or deliberative process protected by the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment because the offenses alleged were not related to defendant's legislative activities and should not be clothed with the immunity accorded legislators by the speech or debate clause or otherwise by the separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state brought an action against defendant seeking his removal from office following his conviction for various federal offenses. The state sought a judgment declaring that defendant had forfeited his public offices as senator and as a member of the board of commissioners and as a mayor, by reason of his convictions. The court issued an order that the provisions of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C: 512 (c) were applicable to defendant and that he was forever disqualified from holding any public office or position with the state. The court held that the underlying elements of the federal crimes for which defendant was convicted were all offenses under New Jersey law. The comparable state offenses of bribery, extortion, conspiracy, perjury and false swearing all constituted offenses involving dishonesty since they revealed intent to defraud or deceive. The court further held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C: 51-2 was constitutional. The court held that the charges concerning bribery and extortion and obtaining money under false pretenses, were offenses involving or touching his office as mayor and commissioner, therefore, those positions were forfeited as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held a pre-sentencing hearing to consider three novel questions involving interpretation of the Graves Act (act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-6c and -6d. The first question was whether the state could show by a preponderance of the evidence that a weapon was a firearm when the weapon had not been recovered. The court held that the trial court could take judicial notice of evidence and testimony at trial, as well as presentence reports and other relevant information, in order to make the required finding. The second question was whether the act was unconstitutional as applied to defendant. Defendant asserted that the act required that a new element be established, the operability of a firearm, and that the element could not constitutionally be shown by a standard less than beyond a reasonable doubt. The court disagreed, holding that operability of the firearm was not a necessary showing and that the act was a mandatory sentencing provision and not a separate new crime. The third question was whether an accomplice who never actually possessed the firearm in question was eligible to be sentenced under the act. The court held the act was applicable to accomplices.</SPAN></P>
