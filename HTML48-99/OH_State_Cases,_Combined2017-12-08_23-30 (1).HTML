</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation strip mined a property consisting of 18.2 acres of land.

The Chief's decision was upheld by the Reclamation Board of Review, and in turn by the trial court. On appeal, the corporation raised three allegations of error, including, inter alia, that &sect; 1513.16 was unconstitutionally vague and an illegal delegation of power by the legislature to an administrative officer. The court found that &sect; 1513.16 was not unconstitutionally vague because a reasonable and practical construction could be given to its language. The court held that the statute used words in common use and that the words could be construed in the ordinary meaning attributed to them in the mining and reclamation industry. The court further held, in affirming the trial court's decision, that the statute did not unconstitutionally delegate the state legislature's authority to an administrative body.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bar owner filed an application with the Department of Liquor Control for renewal of his liquor permits. The Director of the Department rejected the application. At a subsequent hearing, testimony from two police officers along with police reports were presented as evidence of fights, arrests, and other problems at the bar owner's bar. The Liquor Commission upheld the Department's decision denying the renewal application. On appeal, the bar owner raised several allegations of error, including, inter alia, that the admission of police reports into evidence violated the Ohio Rules of Evidence. The court found that the police reports were properly authenticated under Ohio R. Evid. 901(A), 901(B)(7). The court further found that the police reports did not constitute hearsay because they were not admitted to prove the truth of the allegations they contained, but merely to prove that the police were called to the bar on numerous occasions. In affirming the trial court's decision, the court also found that the Department did have the authority to reject the renewal application based upon &quot;good cause&quot; without running afoul of the bar owner's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Mentor Municipal Court (Ohio) finding him guilty of possession of marijuana, a misdemeanor. The assigned error was whether the trial court erred in placing defendant on three years probation in addition to ordering him to pay the maximum fine of $ 100.00.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court had previously held that the Mentor City Ordinance that imposed a more severe penalty for possession of marijuana than that imposed by the state statute was unconstitutional. The court observed that the nature of the city penalty was significantly changed when the local ordinance imposed a jail sentences for possession of less than 100 grams of marijuana when the same offense was treated by state statute as a minor misdemeanor punishable only by a fine. The court also noted that the trial court had subsequently attempted to impose an additional penalty, namely probation of three years in addition to the fine. The court reversed in part, eliminating the sentence of probation, and affirmed in part as to the $ 100 fine. The court held that, in addition to the fact that the city could not impose a more severe penalty for the offense than was provided by state law, the trial court could not impose probation where there was not imprisonment. Ohio law provided for probation in the context of suspending a sentence of imprisonment and providing for supervision by the probation department in lieu of jail time. As there was no imprisonment involved, probation could not be imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified in part so as to eliminate the sentence of probation, and affirmed in part as to the $ 100.00 fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two detectives viewed two movies at a theater. The detectives completed a report detailing the plot of the movies and describing several scenes. The report chronicles instances of fellatio, cunnilingus, intercourse, and male orgasm, and depictions of urination in one of them. A sergeant used the report as information upon which he based an affidavit for a search warrant to seize the films. The films were seized pursuant to the warrant and defendant, who was working at the theater at the time, was served with a summons for pandering obscenity. His motion to suppress the films as evidence was denied and he was convicted. He appealed. The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the films. The information contained in the report made by the two detectives, upon which the warrant was based, provided sufficient evidence from which a neutral magistrate could have reached an independent conclusion that probable cause existed to believe that the films were obscene. The verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The jury had sufficient evidence to support all elements of the offense, including the obscenity of the movies shown.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted on attempted aggravated burglary and possession of criminal tools. He appealed a judgment of the Common Pleas Court, County of Lorain, Ohio, which convicted him of possession of criminal tools. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the charge of attempted aggravated burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant assigned various errors in the trial court proceedings. Three of his errors went primarily to the weight of the evidence. In sustaining the conviction, the court examined the record and found that the verdict was supported by the evidence. Defendant further claimed that because the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the attempted aggravated burglary charge, the guilty verdict on the charge of possession of criminal tools could not stand. The court rejected that argument, finding that the verdicts were neither legally nor logically inconsistent. In addition, because defendant did not object at trial to the jury instructions, he could not assign as error on appeal the giving or the failure to give any instructions. The court also rejected defendant's argument that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24, of which defendant stood convicted was blatantly unconstitutional on its face as being overbroad and violative of both procedural and substantive due process and equal protection doctrines. The court found that similar statutes from other jurisdictions had uniformly withstood such void for vagueness attacks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1333.92, proposing, planning, or operating a pyramid sales plan or program. Defendant pled not guilty and filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. The Common Pleas Court of Ross County (Ohio) found that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and dismissed the indictment. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State asserted that &sect; 1333.92 was not unconstitutionally overbroad. The trial court found that under the statute one who merely planned, for whatever reason, a pyramid scheme as defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1333.91, would be subject to arrest and conviction and possible fine and incarceration. The trial court felt that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1333.92 was overly broad and failed to apprise an ordinary person of the proscriptions intended by a legislative enactment. The court agreed with the trial court's reasoning. The court found that the use of the words plan and prepare in the statute had no definiteness as to when planning or preparing became illegal. The statute failed to specify what plans or preparations were sufficient to subject one to the penalties of the statute. Furthermore, the statute did not specify whether one must act affirmatively to be brought within the terms of the statute, or if one's failure to act subjected them to criminal liability. The wording of the statute failed to provide an ascertainable standard of guilt, and required a person of ordinary intelligence to guess whether one's conduct was unlawful, contrary to the demands of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The authorities went to defendant's medical center to serve capiases on his employees who failed to testify before the grand jury in a separate case concerning defendant.

After waiting two hours for defendant's attorney to arrive, the authorities broke through the office door; however, they were unable to locate the people named in the capiases. The trial court tried the obstructing official business charge separately from other counts of the indictment against defendant and he was found guilty. The court found that it was not error to try the obstructing official business count separately, as the severance was requested by his co-defendants, who were not named in the other counts, and that count involved facts and issues different than those in the remaining counts. The court reversed the conviction, however, as the authorities possessed no valid search warrant and there were no circumstances obviating the warrant requirement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties were divorced. After filing for bankruptcy, the husband failed to pay the marital debts as prescribed by the divorce decree.

The trial court denied both motions, holding that the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy law, 11 U.S.C.S. &sect; 362, prohibited it from exercising its contempt power, and the wife appealed. The court held that: (1) the automatic stay provision was unconstitutional as violative of U.S. Const. amend. X insofar as it stayed a state court contempt action to enforce a divorce order dividing marital property because it regulated the state as a state, it addressed an attribute of state sovereignty, it divided the marital property in a way different from the equitable division previously ordered by the trial court, and the federal interest in discharging debts in bankruptcy did not justify what amounted to a redivision of marital property; and (2) there was no change of circumstances justifying an increase in child support given its ruling on the husband's obligation to pay the marital debts. The judgment was reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the motion for an increase in child support, but reversed and remanded for further proceedings the denial of the motion for contempt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the Board's action to terminate the parents' parental rights, the court of common pleas first awarded temporary custody of the parents' children to the Board and then awarded permanent custody to the Board.

The court of common pleas also erred by granting permanent custody to the Board based on its first and only complaint. Because the court of common pleas awarded only temporary custody initially, the Board's complaint did not justify awarding permanent custody. Afterward, when new and changed conditions occurred that justified making the Board's custody permanent, the Board was required to file a new complaint to notify the parents specifically of the grounds upon which the permanent custody order was to be based. The Board did not file a new complaint, and the court of common pleas erred by proceeding to grant permanent custody under the Board's complaint.</SPAN></P>

The Board denied the license based on the hearing and a notarized statement regarding supervision of the psychologist's work. The trial court found that the Board's decision was based on reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that although the psychologist met the educational requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4732.15(B)(2), her work experience was tainted.

A district hearing officer determined that the claimant had a permanent partial disability of 22 percent, but declined to award benefits. After a staff hearing officer affirmed the denial, the claimant sought judicial review. The claimant contended that the 100 percent ceiling on awards contained in &sect; 4123.57(B) was unconstitutional. The administrator contended that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter because it involved a question of &quot;extent of disability.&quot; On appeal of the trial court's subsequent decision, the court reversed and remanded because the assertion of the claimant that the provisions of &sect; 4123.57(B) were unconstitutional was within the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At defendant's trial for carrying a concealed weapon, evidence was presented to show that a loaded, operable pistol was found under the floor mat behind defendant's car seat.

The trial court held that he failed to establish that affirmative defense, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12(C)(2). On appeal, the court held that it was defendant's burden, not the State's, to prove he was in the class of persons entitled to carry a concealed weapon. Because there was no plain error, within the meaning of Ohio R. Crim. P. 52(B), the court refused to consider defendant's new argument that the Act was vague and overbroad. Further, because defendant failed to object below to the requirement that he prove his affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence, the court refused to consider that issue on appeal. The court held that the trial court's judgment was not against the manifest weight of the evidence, and that the trial court properly found defendant's crime to be non-probationable under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bid requirements for the construction contract required a certain percentage of subcontractors to be minority enterprises.

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The contractors had standing because they bid on the contract. The subcontractors had standing because they submitted price quotations to the general contractors. The association had standing because the members of the association were threatened with loss of bids through the exclusion from a percentage of the construction dollars for the project involved, the association sought to protect its members from being deprived of an opportunity to fairly bid on such projects, and there was no requirement that individual members participate in this suit.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the obscene nature of the two publications did not affect the validity of defendant's arrest, that the prosecutor's opening statement did not deprive defendant of her right to a fair trial, and that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury because Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 701.02 did not apply to the facts of the case, or, in the alternative, that it was unconstitutional as applied to the case. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 701.02 provided that a police officer was not personally liable for damages for injury or death caused while engaged in the operation of a motor vehicle while responding to an emergency call. The court held that the provisions of &sect; 701.02 applied to the police officer and, therefore, he was immune from liability. The court also rejected the estate's argument that &sect; 701.02 was unconstitutional as the Ohio Supreme Court had previously determined that &sect; 701.02 was a constitutional exercise of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was involved in an altercation with a co-worker that resulted in defendant shooting the co-worker to death. Defendant, who was an alien, was convicted of aggravated murder, and challenged the conviction raising three points of error. Defendant first argued that the trial court abused its discretion by not providing a procedure for simultaneous translation of testimony offered at trial. The court held that there was no evidence that defendant was prejudiced by the delayed translation. Defendant next argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. The court held that sufficient evidence was adduced to have sustained the conviction of aggravated murder. Defendant's third argument provided that it was unconstitutional to have required him to prove self-defense. Defendant specifically argued that his proof negated a necessary element of the crime charged by the state. The court held, however, that the defense did not serve to negative the essential elements of an offense. Rather, it admitted the existence of such an act but set forth a separate justification apart from the cited act for it. Defendant's conviction, therefore, was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer was at headquarters when he learned of a breaking and entering in progress at a specific address. He undertook an emergency run. The officer was given additional information on the radio that the suspect was still sitting in the driveway and that he was the grandson of the caller. Ten seconds later, the officer was involved in the collision. Defendants conceded a dispute as to whether subsequent information on the radio was actually received while the officer was on the emergency run. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendants. On appeal, the injured parties asserted that reasonable minds could have differed as to whether the officer was on an emergency call at the time of the collision. Affirming the judgment, the court stated that it was legislative policy to free defendants from liability in responding to calls for immediate help. The urgency of the situation demanded immediate judgment and action without full knowledge of the operative facts. The record did not disclose evidence from the dispatcher that the emergency was over. The fact that the call subsequently developed into a false alarm did not change the character of the emergency response.</SPAN></P>

Defendant attempted to collect his money several times from the dancer at her place of work. He testified that the waitress told him that the dancer's check was probably beside the cash register. The evidence was conflicting as to whether defendant was depressing the buttons on the cash register to open the money drawer or was searching through the papers to the left of the register when the barmaid returned and saw him behind the bar next to the cash register. Defendant and the barmaid fought over two pistols which were kept on the right side of the cash register. Defendant saw the dancer with a drawn derringer and shot her once and fled from the bar. The court held that there was evidence from which a jury could believe that defendant did not intend to steal money not belonging to him. The court held that the refusal of the proposed jury instruction was prejudicial to defendant because the aggravated murder conviction rested upon the aggravated robbery felony, which was based on the commission of a theft offense to which mistake of fact was a defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Ravenna Municipal Court of the County of Portage (Ohio), which convicted her of disorderly conduct in violation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a high school teacher, was arrested for hindering the flow of traffic outside the city board of education building. The incident occurred while defendant was picketing during a teachers strike. Thereafter, defendant was found guilty of disorderly conduct in violation &sect; 2917.11(A)(4). On appeal, the court noted that the Ohio Supreme Court had not found any infirmity in the &sect; 2917.11(A) terms, &quot;inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm.&quot; Even so, defendant had not demonstrated a constitutional infirmity with the required degree of proof. Thus, &sect; 2917.11(A)(4) was not void for vagueness. Further, &sect; 2917.11(A)(4) was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant because there was no unconstitutional restriction in the manner in which the police allowed traffic to pass nor any arbitrary enforcement based upon the content of the pickets' message. Moreover, the trial court's determination from the bench and its findings were sufficient to make the right of appeal meaningful. Finally, the prosecution was not required to offer all of its photographs of the incident into evidence. As defendant had access to the photographs during discovery, the trial court's ruling did not prejudice her.</SPAN></P>

However, defendant placed his foot in the door and would not remove himself from the doorway, although requested to do so on several occasions. Defendant was then arrested for disorderly conduct pursuant to 509.03(A)(4). The testimony was unequivocal that there were no other persons entering or leaving the bank at the time that defendant was blocking the doorway and that defendant did not hinder or prevent the movement of anyone. The court reversed. There was no evidence that defendant's conduct hindered, prevented, or interfered with the movements or rights of others, and the prosecution failed to demonstrate an element of the crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's husband died after a brief struggle during which a knife held by defendant pierced his chest and fatally wounded him. Defendant sought a dismissal of the trial on the grounds that a coroner's report listed the legal cause of death as an accident and argued that such finding precluded the indictment. On appeal, defendant reasserted that complaint and further argued, among other things, that her conviction was impermissibly based on circumstantial evidence that did not prove all the essential elements of the crime. The court, in affirming her conviction, disagreed. First, the court noted that the coroner's report was not conclusive of criminal liability or responsibility and determined that its conclusions with respect to the manner and mode of death were limited to the medical matters within its expertise. Accordingly, the court concluded that the coroner lacked power to forestall judicial process by its negative finding. Next, found that the circumstantial evidence showed that there was ample basis for an inference of a knowing, voluntary act by defendant in stabbing the victim and that nothing in the evidence led to any reasonable alternative inference of accident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following the judgment that held that the parental immunity doctrine was without sufficient justification to warrant its retention, the insurance company sought review of the decision. The insurance company argued that the trial court erred in holding that there was insufficient justification to warrant the retention of the parental immunity doctrine. The court held that the parental immunity doctrine did not deprive a child of his right to due process of law or to his day in court. It was held that the doctrine of parental immunity, because of its distinct nature, always required a hearing on its applicability to each individual case. Thus, the court held that the trial court erred in holding the parental immunity doctrine to be unconstitutional. Additionally, the court reasoned that the trial court erred in concluding that appellees were legally entitled to recover damages from their mother, and in finding that the insurance company was therefore liable under the contract of insurance. Lastly, the court found that it could not conclude that the insurance company satisfied its burden of demonstrating that the exclusion of uninsured motorist coverage was legally effective.</SPAN></P>

One brother claimed he participated because the Navy man was his friend, and the other brother stated he made the sale because it was for his brother. The court rejected defendants' argument that the definition of &quot;unit dose&quot; in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.01(F) was so lacking in ascertainable standards as to be unconstitutionally vague. The court found no evidence of vindictive prosecution and no error in the jury instruction on entrapment. The court held that the verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court observed that defendants failed to comply with Ohio R. Crim. P. 30 by not submitting their requested instructions in writing, and they did not state with sufficient specificity the matter within the charge to which they objected nor supply with sufficient clarity the omission they asserted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which had convicted defendants of selling LSD in an amount equal to or exceeding three times the bulk amount, 100 unit doses.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2151.04. The trial court awarded permanent custody of the daughter to appellee county welfare department and terminated the mother's parental rights pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.353. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother's daughter was committed to the temporary custody of the county welfare department. Thereafter, the mother executed and delivered to the department a permanent surrender document, in which she relinquished permanent guardianship of her child. Later, however, she notified the department of her decision to rescind the surrender. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the trial court found the daughter to be a dependent child and, ultimately, committed her to the department's permanent custody. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court held that the trial court erred in adjudicating the child dependent and in permanently committing her to the department on the basis of the permanent surrender document, which was later revoked. The court noted that the mother's desire to revoke the permanent surrender document was manifested before the document was approved by the trial court, and that it was evident that the trial court considered the document when it decided both the adjudication and the disposition. The court rejected the mother's claims that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.04 and &sect; 2151.353 were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision, finding that there was no basis for dismissing the action upon the ground that it was not brought against the State or that the agencies were not instrumentalities of the State because all defendants were State officers or agencies by virtue of &sect; 3929.74. The court also ruled that plaintiff's action was properly before the trial court because Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant, a truck driver, had a flat tire on the turnpike and stopped on an exit ramp to change the tire. A co-worker from the same truck company stopped to help him. The co-worker was run over by another truck. The claimant became very upset at seeing the co-worker dismembered and was diagnosed with acute anxiety reaction. The court noted that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.01(C), an injury was that which was caused by an external accidental means, or which was accidental in character and result, received in the course of the employment. The court noted further that emotional stress was not a compensable injury unless accompanied by a physical injury. The claimant argued that distinguishing between disabilities occasioned by physical injury and those occasioned by emotional stress was contrary to the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend XIV. The court affirmed the summary judgment confirming the denial of benefits. The court concluded that it was bound under the doctrine of stare decisis to follow prior case law holding that there was no denial of equal protection in the exclusion of injuries occasioned by only emotional stress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a county commissioner who lost his reelection. Prior to the end of his term, a bill was passed by the State providing for pay raises for several county officials. At a meeting of the county commissioners, defendant indicated that he opposed the bill. Thereafter, he contacted other county officials and indicated that he would support the bill if he was promised a job when his term was up. On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that (1) the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of the assistant prosecutor because his testimony was barred under the attorney-client privilege; (2) the trial court erred in denying his motion for acquittal; and (3) his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Upon review, the court found defendant's arguments without merit. Defendant's conviction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.02(b) was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.

The mortgagor also counterclaimed, seeking money damages and an injunction against the replevy of the aircraft prior to a final judgment. The trial court rendered a prejudgment order of replevin. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 2737.02 did not comply with the Ohio and United States constitutional requirement for due process of law. First, the order for delivery of the personal property was issued by a clerk and not by a judge. Second, the only condition precedent to the issuance of the order was a filing of an affidavit of a plaintiff, his agent, or his attorney.

The trial court granted a motion in favor of defendant and dismissed the indictment. Essentially, the trial court found that defendant's right to a speedy trial had been violated when a subsequent indictment was filed. The court reversed and remanded the case. The court found that defendant had acquiesced to the prosecution's failure to conduct a timely preliminary hearing. The facts indicated that defendant had raised the issue at his preliminary hearing, but had failed to raise it when he went before the trial court. Finally, the court found that the prosecution's case was not prejudiced when the trial court failed to record its findings of fact and conclusions of law during the motion to dismiss as required by Ohio R.

Code Ann. &sect; 5123.19(D) authorized the operation of a licensed family home in an agricultural district as a permitted use was rejected as &sect; 5123.19(D) was a &quot;special law&quot; that violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26. The board's determination that the family home did not keep the general harmony of the zoning plan was not illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by a preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the whole record. Estoppel was inapplicable to enforcement of the zoning regulations as the regulations were adopted under the police power, carried a penalty for violation, and were, therefore, malum prohibitum. The applicants received proper notice of the board's hearing and decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) convicting him of the offense of passing bad checks, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.11. When the trial court gave the jury instructions on the presumption of intent to defraud found in &sect; 2913.11, the counsel for defendant objected on constitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After his check to a store was returned, the store sent a notice of dishonor, by certified letter, to defendant. The notice gave defendant 10 days to resolve the matter, but he did not do so within 10 days. During deliberations, the jury requested a re-reading of the law of the case due to some confusion. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the statutory presumption. The court overruled the assignment of error, finding that the legislature intended that a jury be made aware of the presumption by way of a trial court's instructions. The court also held that the presumption was neither arbitrary nor irrational, noting that people did not write checks on nonexistent accounts or accounts with insufficient funds unless there was an intent to defraud. Finally, the soundness of the presumption was further enhanced by the provision permitting rectification of honest mistakes by payment within 10 days of the notice of dishonor. The court sustained one assignment of error, finding that the trial court's instructions mentioned only once that the presumption was rebuttable and that no explanation as to its proper use by the jury was given.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment in part, finding that the statutory presumption was sound and that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury on the presumption. The court reversed the judgment in part, finding that the trial court failed to adequately instruct the jury on the nature and the effect of the rebuttable presumption. Accordingly, the court remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his conviction in the Common Pleas Court of Summit County (Ohio) for rape. He contended that the indictment was unconstitutionally vague; that the trial court erred in permitting the eight-year-old victim to testify, in admitting evidence that the child victim suffered from a venereal disease, and in denying his motion for severance; and that the judgment was against the weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and his brother were charged with raping defendant's eight-year-old stepdaughter. The indictment alleged that the rape occurred during a 10-month period. The court held that the time of the offense was not an essential element of the offense. It was sufficient to prove that the offense occurred on or about the time charged. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the child was competent to testify. Defendant failed to meet his burden of showing prejudice from the joinder of his case with his brother's for trial. There was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of the offense. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting a doctor to testify that the child suffered from gonorrhea. The evidence was admitted to show that the child had sexual relations with someone. The evidence did not cause unfair prejudice or confuse or mislead the jury.</SPAN></P>

That others similarly situated to defendants were not prosecuted did not establish a constitutional violation of selective enforcement unless defendants could prove that the prosecutor's decision to prosecute them was based upon an impermissible consideration, such as race or religion.

The property owners conceded that if the subdivision were allowed, the resulting lots would have violated the new ordinance's lot size requirements. The court reversed the judgment and entered judgment on favor of the property owners. Under the Fourteenth Amendment and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 19, the property owners had vested rights in the lot before the ordinance was enacted. The right to subdivide the lot and to separately sell the resulting lots was one of the vested rights.

Defendants were warned that they were on private property and would be arrested if they did not leave. They did not leave and were charged with criminal trespass in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.21(A)(2). After a second trial, defendants were convicted on the charges. The court affirmed defendants' convictions. The court ruled that the trial court properly denied defendants' motions for acquittal. The court held that trespassers did not have a right to exercise their rights to free speech on property that was not open to the general public. The court also ruled that there was not a material variance between the charges under &sect; 2911.21(A)(2) and the proof regarding defendants' knowing entry of the restricted property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insured purchased a truck from a dealer. He also purchased credit disability insurance from the insurer and paid the premium as a part of the total financing package. Under the terms of the policy, the insurer was to pay a certain amount each month to the dealer for any balance of the loan period which might remain in the event of the insured's disability. The insured subsequently became disabled. Prior to that time, he had become delinquent in his installment payments. The dealer took possession of the truck and ultimately sold it. On appeal, the court held that the trial court was warranted in finding that the case involved a retail installment contract arising out of a consumer transaction. The truck was legally repossessed under the meaning of the policy when it was sold. The court ruled that if the insured had become disabled before he defaulted on the installment contract, the trial court would have been justified in requiring the insurer to pay monthly policy benefits through the date the truck was sold. The court noted, however, that the insured was in default prior to his becoming disabled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant husband challenged the decision of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations (Ohio), which enforced by contempt a separation agreement incorporated into a final decree of dissolution requiring the husband to pay for the education of his and appellee wife's child at a religious institution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The essential issue was whether enforcement of a separation agreement requiring the husband to pay tuition for his child's education at a religiously-oriented school constituted unconstitutional state support of such religiously-oriented school. The court affirmed. The court found that the husband raised no objection to the religious upbringing of his child and made no contention that the decree interfered with his own free exercise of religion. The court determined that the minimal involvement of the State in indirectly and consequently &quot;supporting&quot; the Christian school by requiring the husband to pay tuition for his child in accordance with his contractual obligation had to be balanced against the right of the wife, as custodial parent, to send her child to a religiously-oriented private school, as well as against the constitutional prohibition against the State's impairing the obligations of a contract. The court found that, when so balanced, the minimal &quot;support&quot; of religion was overwhelmed by the other considerations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment enforcing the agreement requiring the husband to pay for the child's education at a religious institution was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee, the Registrar of the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles, mailed a notice of suspension. Appellant licensee challenged a judgment of the Civil Division of the Municipal Court of Dayton (Ohio), which determined that his failure to timely file a petition to show cause why his license should not be suspended, as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.40(K), constituted a jurisdictional defect that precluded consideration of his claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The licensee conceded the fact of notification of his license suspension by the Registrar. On appeal, he argued that the trial court erred in finding that the time period provision of &sect; 4507.40(K) for filing a petition to show cause was a condition precedent to subject matter jurisdiction. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which had found that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of the show cause petition because the licensee had failed to timely file his petition. Also, the licensee had failed to assert that the notice of suspension had not been mailed at the proper time. A hearing on that matter was unnecessary, and the trial court did not err by not holding a hearing to determine whether jurisdiction existed. The application of &sect; 4507.40(K) to the licensee was constitutional and did not violate the Due Process Clause because &sect; 4507.40(K) clearly provided the licensee with an opportunity to be heard by timely filing a petition to show cause why the license suspension should not take effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment, which had determined that the trial court was precluded from exercising jurisdiction to consider the merits of the licensee's petition to show cause why his license should not be suspended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties were granted a divorce in Kansas. Thereafter, the mother initiated proceedings in the trial court under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act alleging that the father had failed to pay child support and insurance premiums. The trial court ordered the father to pay $ 200 per month in child support, but later granted the father's motion to terminate the support order because he had been deprived of his visitation rights. The mother then obtained journalization of the judgments in Kansas and commenced the instant action to collect on the Kansas judgments. The trial court entered a judgment for the mother. On appeal, the father argued that his procedural due process rights were violated in obtaining the foreign judgments and said judgments were therefore not entitled to full faith and credit when sued upon in this jurisdiction. The court found that the notice given to the parent at the time of the original proceedings leading to the support order was considered sufficient notice. Such a judgment was entitled to full faith and credit in Ohio so long as the court which rendered the judgment had no authority to modify retroactively the amount of child support due.</SPAN></P>

Thus, she had been overpaid as a result of the erroneous calculation of her years of experience, and repayment would be made through adjustments to her salary checks. The teacher complied with the request for repayment and later filed an action based on such repayment. The trial court denied the teacher's request for relief and the court affirmed. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 117.10, which created procedures for recovering alleged overpayments, did not apply because the board's actions were not based upon a report of the bureau of inspection. The court found that the teacher had waived her right to assert a violation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State challenged a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Tuscarawas County (Ohio), which dismissed a count of an indictment against defendant for the reason that the indictment was constitutionally insufficient because the time of the alleged offense included a period of a month. The dismissed count charged defendant with unlawful sexual conduct with a child less than 13 years of age, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(A)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's motion to dismiss the challenged count was based on the contention that the period of a &quot;month&quot; was in and of itself too vague to constitute a sufficient indictment. On review, the State contended that the trial court erred in dismissing that count of the indictment. The court noted that a defendant in crimes other than those of a continuing nature was entitled to have an indictment which set forth each single offense with which he was being charged by a grand jury. An indictment which did not meet that test could not be corrected by a bill of particulars and could be subject to dismissal. Although the instant indictment named a victim, and did not specifically describe multiple occurrences, it did not negate the possibility of multiple acts in view of the time frame. The court further noted that the use of the term &quot;conduct&quot; in the indictment could include single or multiple events. Moreover, the State had attempted the amend the time frame to a different month, which effectively presented a prosecutorial indictment rather than the constitutionally-guaranteed grand jury indictment. Accordingly, the trial court properly dismissed the count for time vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee filed a worker's compensation claim against the employer for emotional stress unaccompanied by any physical injuries. The trial court granted the employer's motion for summary judgment, dismissing the employee's claim. The trial court's judgment was affirmed. The court held that the challenged classification did not put a burden on a suspect group or on a fundamental interest, and the state had a legitimate interest in maintaining the self-supporting nature of the worker's compensation fund. Thus, the employee's equal protection argument failed because there was nothing in the Constitution which required a state to compromise its legitimate interests just for the sake of expanding worker's compensation coverage to include injuries that arose solely from emotional stress. Simply put, emotional stress injuries unaccompanied by physical trauma were not compensable within the meaning of the Worker's Compensation Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with aggravated burglary and receiving stolen property. The trial court reduced the first charge to breaking and entering. On the day of trial, defendant filed a motion for severance of the offenses. The trial court denied the motion. Following a trial, defendant was found guilty of only receiving stolen property. The trial court also indicated that his decision to not sever the offenses was correct because they constituted a continuous sequence and were so interrelated that it would have been unduly burdensome to sever the offenses and try them separately. On appeal, defendant argued that his motion to sever the counts should have been granted. The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction. The court noted Ohio R. Crim. P. 12(C) required pretrial motions to be filed within 35 days of arraignment or seven days before trial. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the late motion. The court also held that defendant was not prejudiced as a result.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that where the state, by its prosecutor or its witnesses, denied defendant his fundamental right to a continuous, complete trial to a verdict, the state could not place such defendant in jeopardy again for the same offense.

During the argument, defendant shot the other man in the chest. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in charging the jury on aggravated assault under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.12 because the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court refused to address defendant's argument because he failed to preserve the issue by objecting o the trial court's instruction to the jury on the lesser included offense of aggravated assault. Next, defendant contended that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury on the lesser included offense of assault. The court also rejected this contention because it concluded that the evidence before the trial court did not justify the giving of the requested instruction on assault. The court said that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the lesser included offenses of felonious assault and aggravated assault, both of which involved the use of a deadly weapon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A portion of the shopping mall was zoned as part of a general retail district. The city claimed that a portion of the same mall was zoned as a local retail district or a shopping center district, neither of which classifications would permit usage for entertainment. Appellees claimed that the total mall was within a general retail business district and that contrary notations on the city's zoning maps were never authorized by legislative actions of the city council. Use of property for entertainment, amusement, or recreation was clearly permissible in a general retail business district. On appeal, the court found that the board did not abuse its discretion in permitting the variance, even if a portion of the complex was within a more restrict zoning classification. The court held that there was ample evidence to support the board's exercise of its authority within the designated limits and to exercise its discretion by making the challenged order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant liquor investigators challenged a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County (Ohio), which dismissed, for lack of jurisdiction, their appeal of an order of the Ohio State Personnel Board of Review that reversed the Board's previous order and reinstated 30 day suspensions for employment misconduct. Appellee Ohio Department of Liquor Control had moved for reconsideration of the original order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A hearing examiner presented a report and recommendation that the original 30-day suspensions be modified to five days. The Department filed written objections to the examiner's report but the Board's original order adopted the examiner's report and recommendation. Upon reconsideration, the Board reversed itself and reinstated the original 30-day suspensions. On appeal, the investigators argued in part that the trial court had erroneously dismissed their appeal because it had jurisdiction to review the Board's order pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12. In affirming judgment, the court found that the right to appeal was actually specified in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.34, and &sect; 124.34 did not provide for civil appeals of suspensions imposed by the Board. The court observed that &sect; 124.34 was more specific than Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12, and therefore &sect; 124.34 controlled. The court concluded that the trial court correctly determined that it had no jurisdiction over the action and overruled all of the investigators' assignments of error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent committed suicide with a valuable Browning shotgun. The coroner investigated and confiscated the gun. The administratrix sought to recover the gun, but the relief she won was reversed on appeal. She then sought a declaration that &sect; 313.141, providing for the confiscation of firearms by the coroner, was unconstitutional. The trial court did not grant the declaration. The court reasoned that if &sect; 313.141 were to apply to all firearms, the provision in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 313.14 directing the coroner to dispose of firearms in accordance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 313.141 would be surplusage. The court further reasoned that such a construction would contradict Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 313.22. The court ruled that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 313.141 provided the means for disposal only of those firearms included in the effects over which the coroner had the power of disposition under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 313.14, property found in relation to unclaimed bodies, the cost of burial of which was paid by the county. The court further ruled that in all other cases the coroner should proceed pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 313.22. The court did not address any constitutional issues.</SPAN></P>

The airport employees claimed that the trial court erred in holding that the annexation was complete upon entry of the county commissioners' order that authorized it and in holding that an election was not required prior to the annexation. On appeal, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.19 did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26 because it applied uniformly to all similarly situated property. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.19 was not special legislationeven though it could only have been used to annex one airport in the state at that particular time.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with two counts of loitering and the trial court granted her motion to dismiss on the ground that &sect; 17-10-112 was void for vagueness. On appeal, the city argued in part that the loitering ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague and that the trial court erred in finding that the affidavits that charged defendant with loitering had not informed her of the specific activity which allegedly violated the law. Defendant argued that the ordinance was defective because it did not list specific conduct that an officer could use to infer that a suspect is loitering for the purpose of soliciting others to engage in illicit sexual conduct. In reversing judgment, the court applied a presumption in favor of the constitutionality of legislation to interpret the language of the ordinance and concluded that it was not vague. The court also ruled that the complaints were constitutionally sufficient to fairly inform defendant of the nature of the charges and to allow her to prepare a defense because they substantially followed the language of the ordinance, apprising her of the offense charged and enabling the trial court to see which ordinance the charge was based upon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had separated from his wife and the day of the shooting they had abandoned reconciliation efforts.

Defendant admitted that he shot the window out of a car, which injured his wife. However, he testified that the boyfriend shot at him first and that he carried a gun and he had fired at the car in self-defense. The wife gave conflicting testimony about whether the boyfriend had a gun. On appeal, defendant claimed that he was denied a fair trial because the prosecutor cross-examined two defense witnesses concerning his good character, the court admitted an incriminating note written by him, and the jury was instructed that he had the burden of proving self-defense. The court found that defendant's claims lacked merit. The character evidence was properly admissible under Ohio R. Evid. 404(A) and it was not prejudicial. The court, applying Ohio R. Evid. 403(A), found that the probative value of the note was not outweighed by the likelihood of unfair prejudice and that under Ohio Rev.

It held that if sufficient standards were adopted, The General Assembly could grant an agency the administrative power to establish the facts and conditions to which governmental policies and legal principles applied. It held that the guidelines included in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.44, used in determining the scheduling of various drugs, were sufficient. Furthermore, the court held that an entity other than a state administrative agency, such as the United States District Attorney, could validly incorporate its narcotic classifications. It noted that some degree of legislative delegation was needed in the complex area of drug control. The General Assembly could not give a drug control program the constant attention that was necessary to avoid the possible effects of a dangerous drug being widely distributed before effective controls were initiated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was originally indicted for one count of aggravated robbery, two counts of kidnapping, one count of carrying a concealed weapon, and one count of having a weapon while under disability. Pursuant to a plea bargain the State dismissed the charges of kidnapping, carrying a concealed weapon and having a weapon while under disability. Defendant then pled guilty to aggravated robbery and kidnapping and was sentenced to concurrent sentences of 6 to 25 years for the aggravated robbery and 4 to 25 years for the kidnapping. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's argument that he was entitled to merger of the kidnapping count with the aggravated robbery count. The court found that there was no evidence indicating a single animus for both offenses. The court also found that all elements of the aggravated robbery offense including the requisite culpable mental state were alleged in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner had filed a series of petitions for post-conviction relief, following the unsuccessful direct appeal of his murder conviction. The table of contents of the appellate brief for the petitioner's most recent petition listed six different claims of error that essentially all alleged that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal. The trial court denied the petition, and the court affirmed. It held that all of the petitioner's claims were or could have been raised previously, either in his appeal or in his previous petitions. The claims of error were, therefore, res judicata because they did not involve exceptional issues that could not be waived. They also did not fall into the categories of errors that required decision by the highest court having jurisdiction. The trial court might have considered petitioner's claims if they had involved claims of a failure to state a cause of action, lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the unconstitutionality of the underlying criminal statute, lack of evidence to support the conviction, or a conviction for an uncharged offense. Petitioner's claims were not well taken.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the section required conduct that was likely to provoke a violent response and that defendant's conduct and remark were not likely to provoke a violent response.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for aggravated murder and proceeded to a jury trial. At the close of the State's evidence, the trial court partially granted defendant's motion for acquittal and reduced the charge to murder. Defendant and the State entered plea negotiations. The trial court entered a plea of guilty, by defendant, to the lesser-included offense of voluntary manslaughter. Reversing, the court determined that the proceedings were so confusing that defendant's guilty plea was not knowingly made. The court found that no prejudice resulted from the technical error of the trial court to have the indictment amended to reflect the charge as murder. The court concluded that the trial court failed to comply with Ohio R. Crim. P. 11 because it commingled voluntary and involuntary manslaughter when discussing defendant's plea. The court determined that the confusion was such that defendant could not have understood the charges against him so that his guilty plea was valid. The court noted that defendant apparently received ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel did no provide the court guidance for an untainted plea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed entrapment after police officers asked him about drugs and he introduced them to a seller. Affirming, the court said that there was ample evidence to sustain a conviction. The jury's verdict showed that the jury believed the prosecution witnesses who testified that the defendant arranged for the officers to buy drugs from the seller. Section 2925.13(B) was neither vague nor overbroad. The trial court acted properly when it refused to order the State to disclose the identity of a confidential informant. Defendant claimed a denial of his right to due process after he was not permitted to call witnesses for his entrapment defense. The court could not hold that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to let the witnesses testify. The court did not know what their testimony would have been. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow defendant to call a witness who ordered the investigation. Nothing showed that he was involved in any plot to entrap defendant or that he had any relevant testimony to offer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal of his conviction for carrying a concealed weapon and for murder, defendant claimed as error the refusal to charge the jury on the lesser-included offense of voluntary manslaughter. The court noted that voluntary manslaughter required a showing of provocation leading to extreme emotional stress. Although defendant and the victim argued, an argument without more did not guarantee that the test was met. The brief verbal encounters did not rise to the level of serious provocation reasonably sufficient to incite use of deadly force. Defendant's claim of unconstitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(A), pertaining to burdens of proof, was without merit. The State was required to prove every element of a crime. However, where a defense did not negate any facts raised in those elements but provided additional facts that exonerated the defendant, the State could place the burden of proof for that defense with the defendant. Thus defendant was not denied due process of law when he was required to affirmatively prove self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The facts showed that the parties were living together prior to the motor vehicle accident at issue.

The passenger claimed that he was asleep at the time of the accident, which he contended was caused by the driver's negligence. The trial court denied the passenger's motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability. The trial court granted the driver's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the doctrine of Interspousal Immunity applied to nonmarried couples living together. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in extending the doctrine of Interspousal Immunity. The court ruled that there was no logical reason for extending the doctrine to apply to individuals living together who were not married, either by a ceremonial marriage or a common law marriage. The court also held that the trial court properly denied the passenger's motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability because the record failed to present any facts establishing the driver's negligence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother argued that the trial court erred in finding as a conclusion of law that the best interest of the child was the sole test of a disposition in a permanent custody case. The court disagreed. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.01 made the welfare of the child paramount and looked to providing care, protection and development in a family environment. It was obvious that the trial court considered the status, fitness, behavior, history, attitude, capacity, and responsibility of the mother in the context of the best interests of the child. The trial court observed the parties; particularly the mother, her candor and demeanor. Also, the mother directed the court to no procedural error in the proceedings that represented a denial of due process. Furthermore, the statute upon which the action was based and the conclusion grounded was not unconstitutionally vague. The term &quot;best interests of the child&quot; was a term of long and general comprehension.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The village adopted an ordinance declaring certain types of buildings a nuisance and providing for their removal. The owner acquired two properties upon which were located a fire-damaged structure. The owner planned to renovate the building for use as an office and made some slight efforts to do so. The village informed the owner that the building was unsafe and a nuisance and contracted to demolish the building when the owner failed to complete renovations within a specified time. The owner sued the village to have the nuisance ordinance declared unconstitutional and sought to enjoin the demolition of his building. On appeal from the trial court's denial of an injunction, the court held that: (1) summary abatement of a public nuisance without a judicial or administrative hearing beforehand was permissible, but the party responsible for the demolition was liable for damages if the property destroyed was not, in fact, a nuisance; and (2) where the evidence before the court revealed that the owner had had multiple hearings and where he had failed to renovate the building in four years of ownership, the trial court's finding was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 511.04, which provided that no owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog could permit or allow such dog to annoy or disturb any person by frequent or habitual howling, yelping, barking, or making of other noises by such dog. Defendant appealed, contending that the ordinance was void because it was both vague and overbroad. The court affirmed and held that the &quot;void for vagueness&quot; doctrine embodied the constitutional requirement of definiteness, which was violated by a criminal statute that failed to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct was forbidden by the statute. The court concluded that the challenged ordinance did not lack the requisite constitutional degree of clarity and definiteness such as to be void for vagueness; rather, the ordinance's prohibitions were clear. Moreover, the court found that although a legislative enactment could be impermissibly broad, even though its language was precise, if constitutionally protected conduct was swept within the parameters of its prohibitions, appellant did not point out any constitutionally protected right which was prohibited by &sect; 511.04.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a licensed podiatrist and held a certificate from federal and state authorities to prescribe controlled substances within the scope of his podiatric practice. He began writing prescriptions for Percodan for a patient for foot pain. Although he discovered the patient and her husband were chemically dependent, he continued to write prescriptions for them. In fact, the husband was not defendant's patient. After the patient and her husband were arrested, defendant was charged with 48 counts of illegally processing of drugs. The jury found him not guilty on the counts involving the patient and guilty of 16 counts involving prescriptions for the husband. On appeal, the court found that defendant was subject to prosecution under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.23(B)(1) because he was a practitioner who intentionally made a prescription that was outside the course of his professional conduct. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.01(CC) was not ambiguous because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2925 was replete with sections that prohibited conduct that exceeded the scope of professional practice. The duplicates of the prescriptions were admissible under Ohio R. Evid. 1003.</SPAN></P>

The purchaser sued pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4549.01 et seq., the Odometer Rollback and Disclosure Act, alleging violations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4549.46. The trial court held that &sect; 4549.46 imposed liability on the seller without regard to knowledge or intent at the time the incorrect odometer affidavit was executed and that &sect; 4549.46 was constitutional even though it imposed strict liability. The seller appealed. The court affirmed because the seller had the means of knowing the true odometer reading. In fact, it was the only person with access to such knowledge. Thus, the seller had a strict duty to ascertain the true mileage of the vehicle. In addition, the liabilities imposed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4549.49 for the violation of Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that his rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution were violated because the legislative classification of cocaine as a controlled substance as a schedule II narcotic was irrational. The court held that the conviction was proper and that defendant's rights were not violated. The court reasoned that while there was a justifiable point that cocaine should not have been a schedule II narcotic, the issue was a matter of public debate best left to the legislature because it involved public policy. Thus, the court lacked the authority to intervene in the legislative determination. Defendant lacked standing to claim that &sect; 2925.03 violated his rights because of the possible imposition of a five-year sentence because defendant did not receive the five-year sentence. Defendant waived the claim that he was forced to take the plea bargain to avoid a potentially longer sentence because the guilty plea was freely and voluntarily made.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred (1) in convicting him of both aggravated arson and arson, because under the circumstances he could have been convicted of only one offense under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25; (2) in overruling his Ohio R. Crim. P. 29 motion for acquittal; and (3) in finding him guilty against the manifest weight of the evidence. Upon review, the court found defendant's arguments without merit. The evidence was sufficient to sustain the guilty finding, because a reasonable mind could have fairly found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant started the fire and that he was sane at the time. Defendant's insanity was not so uncontestably established that as a matter of law he must have been acquitted. By producing a toxic smoke and waiting while it permeated the building before calling the fire department, defendant laid a trap that created a substantial risk of physical harm to the firemen who responded to the call. At no point did the defense object to the finding of guilty as to both offenses either orally or in writing. Therefore, the claim of error was waived.</SPAN></P>

On September 17, 1981, the wife filed her complaint for assault and battery, which was dismissed pursuant to the one-year statute of limitations under &sect; 2305.11. Affirming, the court held that the doctrine of interspousal immunity for negligent torts should not be extended to bar one spouse from suing the other for an intentional tort. The court held that one spouse could sue the other, during coverture, for serious injuries intentionally inflicted during the marriage. However, the court found that the wife's action was not brought until 18 months after the alleged assault and it was barred by &sect; 2305.11. The running of the statute of limitations was not tolled.

They retrieved several items of clothing, including defendant's blood stained jeans which were on top of a pile of the family's dirty clothes. The court held that: (1) the sister's consent to search was voluntarily given; (2) defendant surrendered any expectations of privacy in the blue jeans by discarding them in a common room; (3) defendant's confession was not the result of any misconduct by the police; and (4) because the death penalty was not available as punishment for defendant, he was only entitled to four peremptory challenges under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.22.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant town marshal sought review of an order of the Common Pleas Court of Wood County (Ohio), dismissing his appeal from appellee village's decision to remove him from his job as marshal due to insubordination. The marshal argued that the charges of insubordination were improper and not supported by the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The village mayor filed charges of insubordination, neglect of duty and misfeasance against the town marshal with the village council. The council voted five to one to permanently remove the marshal from his position. The trial court dismissed the marshal's appeal after it found that he was guilty of insubordination. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that a preponderance of the substantial, reliable, and probative evidence supported the village council's finding that the marshal had been insubordinate. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 737.171 clearly authorized the removal of the marshal for insubordination. The court also determined that the deadlock vote of the council was not a final determination on the merits and, therefore, the doctrine of res judicata did not apply. Finally, the marshal was not denied due process of law because the proceedings that resulted in his removal from office adequately informed him of the charges, afforded him an opportunity to deny the charges, to present and cross-examine witnesses, and to appear before the village council during the hearing.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff filed the instant action against defendants, the owner of the property and the employee spraying the water. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of defendants, and plaintiff sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that plaintiff was a recreational user of defendant's property, and therefore, defendant owed plaintiff no duty to keep the premises safe for entry or use. In addition, the court found that the cause of plaintiff's accident was not the spraying of the water upon the path, but plaintiff's approach to jumping a blind hill.

On appeal, defendant assigned 25 assignments of error. The court ruled that no prejudicial error had been committed and affirmed the judgment.

The trial court committed error in its instructions to the jury regarding the culpable mental state for the offense of aggravated murder. The trial court defined purposefulness as mere knowledge of the probable consequences of the act, omitting the potentially crucial element of specific intent. However, the court ruled that in view of the facts in the case, the jury could not have been misled and the error of the court was harmless. Additionally, although it disapproved of the trial court's additions to the jury instructions defining reasonable doubt, the court ruled that the instruction did not constitute prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner driver was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated. He refused to submit to a chemical test to determine the alcohol content of his blood. In due course he was notified of the administrative suspension of his driver's license under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191. He sought relief from suspension with municipal court, alleging, inter alia, that &sect; 4511.191(I) was unconstitutional as it coerced pleas and chilled his right to trial. The municipal court denied the petition. The court affirmed. Under the statute prior to amendment, refusal to submit to a blood alcohol test resulted in an automatic six-month suspension regardless of the plea entered in the related criminal proceedings. This was constitutional. The new &sect; 4511.191(I) terminated suspension based on a guilty or no contest plea. The statute involved a purely administrative proceeding. It had neither a chilling effect on the right to trial nor invidious discrimination. It was not to coerce guilty pleas but to encourage a licensee to take the blood test, recognizing that the goal could be fulfilled either by taking the test or by conceding that its results would be incriminating. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The spouse alleged that the deceased owned a tractor, a gun, a rifle, and two liquor decanters and that the property was in the possession of the mother, who had refused to deliver the property. The spouse did not file an affidavit or a bond with her complaint. The trial court found the wife was the rightful owner of the tractor and firearms, but it did not grant the order of possession on the belief that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2727.20, the spouse was limited to a claim for damages. On appeal, the court reversed the decision and held that the fact that the spouse did not choose to file with her complaint an affidavit and bond did not preclude her from a cause of action in replevin. The bond required by a plaintiff and the re-delivery bond required by a defendant in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2737.07 and &sect; 2737.09 were merely to protect the parties involved and for the indemnification for the wrongful withholding of the other's personal property. Since the mother maintained possession of the property, the spouse's decision not to provide a bond did not defeat her request for an order of delivery at the conclusion of the trial in her favor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the issue was whether the trial court properly determined that the client's action was barred by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11, the statute of limitations requiring claims for malpractice to be filed within one year after the cause thereof accrued. The court held that the trial court did not err in determining that the action against the attorneys was barred by &sect; 2305.11 because: (1) the gist of the client's cause of action was malpractice irrespective of the allegations of the complaint intending to classify her claims as negligence, breach of contract, or fraud; (2) the complaint was filed more than four years after the court of common pleas journalized an entry permitting the attorneys to withdraw as attorneys for the client, which was the latest date upon which the cause of action could have accrued; and (3) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16, the saving statute covering disabilities, did not toll any of the time between the accrual of the cause of action and the filing of the complaint because imprisonment tolled time only if the client was in prison at the time the cause of action accrued and the client was imprisoned after her cause accrued.</SPAN></P>

The evidence consisted of statements allegedly made to the officer by third parties who offered to sell him drugs. The court held that these statements were not hearsay because they were not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but simply to prove that the statements were made. The mere fact that the offers were made was relevant to defendant's guilt regardless of the truth of the offer. Second, the court held that the reclassification of the controlled substance phencyclidine from a schedule III substance to a schedule II substance was valid. The court held that the Ohio legislature was authorized to delegate its power to determine the classification of controlled substances to the attorney general.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, Hamilton County, Ohio, adjudicated a minor child dependent, ordered that she be permanently committed to the care of appellee county welfare department, and terminated appellant mother's parental rights. The mother challenged the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county welfare department sought to declare a minor as a dependent child. A referee appointed the mother's guardian ad litem to serve as the mother's personal counsel. The guardian objected, arguing that an irreconcilable conflict existed between her roles as personal attorney and as guardian ad litem. The trial court overruled the objection and terminated the mother's parental rights, but the court reversed. The mother was entitled to counsel to represent her interest as the natural parent and to serve as an advocate of this parental interest. The guardian, however, was obligated to determine the best interests of the minor parent. The best interests of the parent could run contrary to the parental interest in maintaining custody, thus creating an irreconcilable conflict. The trial court also committed reversible error in failing to bifurcate the adjudicatory and dispositional phases of the commitment proceedings. Because different substantive inquiries took place in each phase of the proceedings, the record must clearly disclose when the emphasis of the inquiry shifted from an adjudicative to a dispositional perspective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of violating Garfield Heights City Ordinance &sect; 505.13, which prohibited destruction of lawns. He sought review, arguing that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and conflicted with a state statute. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. First, the court rejected defendant's claim that the ordinance's use of the word &quot;lawn&quot; was vague. The court found that the ordinance was subject to only one interpretation--it prohibited a vehicle from being driven on or over any public or private lawn. The court said that &quot;lawn&quot; was sufficiently understandable to a person of &quot;common intelligence.&quot; Second, the court held that the ordinance did not conflict with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.06. The court said that they were two independent pieces of legislation that were totally unrelated to one another. Further, the court said that the city's enactment of its ordinance to protect against the destruction of property was a reasonable measure to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the city. As such, the court said, the enactment was authorized by Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. The court held that defendant's remaining points were not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's counsel conceded that the evidence was sufficient to establish defendant's knowing possession of phencyclidine (PCP) under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.41. However, he contended that the evidence was not sufficient to show that the PCP he possessed was in an amount equal to or exceeding the bulk amount but less than three times the bulk amount. Defendant possessed 21 packets of PCP at the time of his arrest. Although the total gram weight was 0.84 grams, the State argued that the 21 packets were more than the bunk amount because they constituted unit doses under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.01(F). Upon review, the court found that the PCP powder in relatively uniform and separately identifiable amounts indicated that each packet was a dose of the controlled substance. Thus, defendant's conviction was proper under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(4). The statutory definition of unit dose at Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.01(F) was not unconstitutionally vague on its face or as it applied to the PCP in defendant's possession.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(1) prohibited offers to sell a controlled substance, not offering the controlled substance. The court rejected defendants' argument that the statute required actual transfer of a controlled substance. Defendants offered to sell a controlled substance, even though they did not deliver a controlled substance. The convictions were therefore proper. The trial court did not err joining the trials because defendants were coconspirators and there was no evidence of prejudice by the joinder for trial of the two cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was initially convicted of, among other things, engaging in organized crime; conspiracy to corrupt another with drugs; conspiracy to possess narcotic drugs; permitting drug abuse; and possession for sale of a narcotic drug. His conviction for conspiracy to corrupt another with drugs was reversed because it merged with the organized crime conviction. The organized crime statute was held unconstitutionally void for vagueness. Thus, the court vacated the reversal of defendant's conviction for conspiracy to corrupt another with drugs. On remand, the trial court modified his sentences under his convictions for possession for sale of a narcotic to ones for aggravated trafficking in drugs. Upon review, the court found that the trial court did err in not running the sentence for defendant's conviction of permitting drug abuse, a misdemeanor, to run concurrently with his sentences for his felony convictions. The trial court properly sentenced defendant under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(6) for aggravated drug trafficking because he had been convicted under Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Akron Municipal Court of the County of Summit, Ohio, which convicted him of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant attended a concert at the music center. The music center did not allow customers to bring bottles or cans into the performance area. Because defendant's cooler contained three cans of a soft drink, he was informed that he had to dispose of the cans before he could enter the center. Defendant claimed that when he verbally protested, the security personnel physically attacked him. The security personnel testified that when he was asked to discard the cans, defendant became violent. Defendant contended that &sect; 2917.11(A) was unconstitutionally vague because inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm was subjective in nature and not a proper guideline for defining criminal conduct. Upon review, the court found that the words inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm were capable of objective measurement in any given situation and provided a guideline for determining criminal culpability under the statute. The trial court did not err in allowing testimony from the prosecution witnesses that no similar incident occurred with any of the other patrons that night because defendant made the security personnel's expertise at crowd control an issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The council member was convicted in federal court of refusal to submit to induction into the armed forces of the United States and was sentenced to federal prison. Under Ohio statutory law in effect at the time of the member's conviction, persons convicted of felonies in the state of Ohio or incarcerated in state prisons were forbidden from holding any public office; however, persons convicted of federal crimes or incarcerated in federal prisons were not included within the ambit of the statutes. The statutes were subsequently amended to cover persons convicted of felonies under federal law. The court held that the amended statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2961.01, as applied to the member and other persons who committed felonies under federal law prior to the amendment of the statute, was invalid under the United States and Ohio Constitutions because it was an ex post facto law and a retroactive law. However, the court held that &sect; 2961.01 was not in conflict with the Home Rule provisions of the Ohio Constitution because the statute did not involve a subject of purely local concern but one of statewide concern, namely, the punishment of felony offenders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petition alleged that the consent of the father was not required because he had failed, without justifiable cause, to communicate with the child or to provide for his maintenance or support for at least one year, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3107.07(A). Even so, the father was entitled to notice of the petition and the time and place of the hearing, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3107.07(B). Notice was served upon the father in accordance with Ohio R. Civ. P. 4.3, which permitted service by certified mail, evidence of which was demonstrated by a return receipt signed by any person. The father did not sign the return receipt. On appeal, the father claimed that Rule 43 was unconstitutional. The court disagreed, noting that precedent held that the Rule was consistent with due process if reasonably calculated to give notice. However, the father did not address the issue of whether the notice given was reasonably calculated to reach him. Indeed, he did not deny actual notice. Further, the six-month waiting period set forth in Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation applied for permits to build outdoor advertising billboards in areas zoned for ordinary or heavy industry. The city building department initially issued the permits but later revoked the permits on the ground that the zoning ordinances prohibit erecting billboards within U5 and U6 districts. At trial, the corporation contended that those sections were construed to permit the erection of billboard in U5 and U6 districts. On review, the court reversed. The court held that the clear intent of the Akron, OH. Zoning Ordinances, chs. 1256-1262 was to exclude U3 uses, including billboards, from U5 and U6 districts. The court concluded that the trial court erred by ignoring the clear intent of the zoning ordinances and granting the corporation's application for a building permit.

The homeowner also contended that the Madison Township Zoning Resolution's definition of &quot;family&quot; was unconstitutional. The court held that the homeowner would not have been operating the facility as a &quot;family home&quot; because the homeowner indicated that she was operating a business for which she was compensated, an office was to be placed in the basement, 24 hour supervision was to be provided for the women residents, and a relief operator was designated in case of the homeowner's absence. The court also held that the operation of the facility was not secondary to the use of the house as a dwelling because her stated intent was to provide a training experience, which was required by statute and administrative regulations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent left one-half of the remainder of his estate to the organization. He also specifically disinherited his two adult children. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2107.06 protected next of kin by limiting a bequest to charity to one-quarter of the value of the net probate estate if a testator died within six months of the making of his will. The decedent so died. As such, the children stood to inherit any remainder above the statutory limitation. The organization contended that the statute was unconstitutional. The court disagreed, noting that precedent held the statute's more liberal predecessor constitutional. Further, the court noted that the right of testamentary disposition had never been regarded as a natural or inalienable right and had always been subject to the control of legislative power. The legislative power was not limited by state constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>

Apparently the trial court converted the motion to dismiss into a summary judgment motion and declared the Ordinance to be invalid. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the union members successfully invoked the court's jurisdiction. However, the court also found that the trial court's original journal entry was not adequate notice to all parties of its intention to covert the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. The court further determined that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the Ordinance changed the city's policy by denying sick leave benefits for sickness or injury sustained off the job because neither party submitted affidavits or documents to support their positions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to her demise, a decedent brought a medical malpractice action against a physician and hospital. The trial court awarded summary judgment to the physician and hospital because it found that the action was not commenced within the time period allowed by Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2305.11 for medical malpractice actions. This decision was affirmed by the court subsequent to an appeal brought by the executor of the decedent's estate. Although the executor asserted that the action should not have accrued until the decedent discovered her injury, the court found that this was not the rule in the State of Ohio. Generally, Ohio law would not permit the statute of limitations to be tolled in a medical malpractice action unless a foreign object was found in the patient's body. The court noted that due process did not require the statute of limitations in such an action to be tolled until the discovery of an injury. Further, the court found that the distinction drawn between foreign objects and other injuries was reasonable and withstood equal protection scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer saw defendant asleep in his automobile. The officer attempted to awaken defendant. The officer observed in plain view three separate containers of substances believed to be illegal drugs. The items were seized and subsequently found to be marijuana, cocaine, and methaqualone. Defendant was charged with drug abuse in violation of &sect; 2925.11. Defendant pleaded guilty. Defendant was then indicted for drug abuse under &sect;. 2925.11 for possession of cocaine and methaqualone. The trial court dismissed the indictment, finding that the prosecution for drug abuse violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The State claimed that defendant's acts constituted three separate offenses because three separate substances were involved. In affirming the trial court's dismissal of the charges, the court held that the simultaneous possession of several controlled substances constituted but a single offense. A review of &sect; 2925.11 indicated the legislature's intent to proscribe possession of any controlled substance. Defendant, having once been placed in jeopardy, could not be prosecuted again.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were each charged with the crime of drunk driving.

Defendants then pled no contest, reserving their right to take an appellate challenge. Each was convicted based on his plea, and each appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that the defendants' constitutional challenge to the presumption of intoxication created by the State's drunk driving statute was a challenge that was waived by the failure to present it to the trial judge. Defendants' claim that the intoxilyzer was an unreliable instrument, incapable of producing reliable evidence, was foreclosed since the legislature had delegated the authority to make that decision to the State health director. Since the intoxilyzer was certified as producing reliable evidence, the evidence produced by it was admissible.</SPAN></P>

Further, where a municipal ordinance imposing criminal penalties upon a contemplated act would be enforced against a person if he proceeded with that act, such person had standing to test the validity, construction, and application of such ordinance by an action for declaratory judgment, and it was unnecessary to demonstrate the existence of an actual controversy for such a person to incur a violation of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State and the attorney general successfully filed a motion to dismiss the action, asserting that the doctrine of sovereign immunity deprived the trial court of jurisdiction over the subject matter.

Appellants sought further review, claiming that the State could be joined as a party as a matter of course because the action was one for a declaratory judgment to determine the constitutionality of a state law. In affirming the dismissal, the court held that Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16 clearly allowed suits to be brought against the State only in the manner provided by law. There was no statutory or case law that supported appellants' position that the State could be joined in the action without its permission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Court of Common Pleas, Hamilton County (Ohio), convicted defendant of carrying a concealed firearm in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12. Although the trial court found that defendant otherwise met the criteria for granting probation, it imposed a sentence of incarceration pursuant to the court's prior interpretation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Several Ohio appellate courts interpreted &sect; 2951.02 differently. The court interpreted &sect; 2951.02(F)(3) to mean that the individuals who were convicted of carrying a concealed weapon were not eligible to receive probation for the crime. Other appellate districts allowed individuals convicted of carrying a concealed weapon to receive probation. Following the interpretation articulated by the court, which was binding on it, the trial court denied defendant's request for a sentence of probation and sentenced him to a term of incarceration. Defendant appealed, asserting that his equal protection rights had been violated. He claimed that it was unconstitutional to have a sentencing option available only to some defendants but not to others, depending upon where they happened to commit their offenses. In affirming, the court held that the Equal Protection Clause only protected against the enactment of statutes that imposed different treatment upon similarly situated classes of individuals, but did not guarantee the uniformity of court interpretation of statutes.&nbsp;Section 2951.02 itself did not discriminate against any class of individuals; thus, no equal protection issues were raised.</SPAN></P>

The Lucas County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) found that the action was barred by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.741 because the passenger had received workers' compensation for her injuries.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver was the passenger's fellow employee. After the passenger successfully applied to receive workers' compensation benefits for her injuries, she filed the action with her husband, seeking to collect additional damages arising out of her injuries. The passenger claimed that, despite the benefits she had received, she should not be barred from filing the action because she and the driver had not been engaged in work-related activity at the time of the accident. Appellants sought further review after the trial court ruled that the action was barred under &sect; 4123.741; they asserted that &sect; 4123.741 had been incorrectly interpreted by the trial court and that the trial court's interpretation violated their equal protection rights and worked harsh, unjust, and conflicting results. In affirming, the court held that &sect; 4123.741 was unambiguous and constitutional. The decision that the passenger was eligible to receive benefits from the workers' compensation fund was conclusive on the issue of whether her injuries were work related. Section 4123.741 barred the passenger from asserting the tort claim because she was eligible to receive benefits from the workers' compensation fund.</SPAN></P>

In overruling all of defendant's assignments of error, the court held that: (1) the State presented a sufficient foundation to admit evidence of defendant's fingerprints, and defendant had ample opportunity to cross-examine the fingerprint expert; (2) evidence of defendant's prior convictions involving dishonesty were properly admitted for impeachment purposes where defendant took the stand to testify in his own behalf; (3) the State proved that defendant deceived the bank because defendant admitted that he used the alias, and the cashier and the office manager testified that defendant falsely told them a check defendant deposited was a cashier's check; (4) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02 required defendant to prove the appropriation of the money was with reasonable justification but the evidence revealed that defendant took the money without justification or excuse; and (5) the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress because he testified that he voluntarily stayed at the police department until the officers arrested him, and he received his Miranda warnings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The church was a nonprofit corporation, which regularly employed persons to operate the church and the church day school. The employees received financial remuneration for their services. The Commission conducted a rating inspection and assessed premiums pursuant to the workers' compensation law. It notified the church that it had to submit the payroll report and remit the assessed premiums. The church refused to submit to these demands and filed suit to enjoin enforcement. On appeal the church challenged the finding that it was an &quot;employer&quot; under the Act. The court found that the language and legislative history admitted to no other conclusion than that churches and their employees were intended to be included within the protection of the Act. The court also rejected the church's argument that compliance abridged its right to freely exercise its religion. The assessments imposed on employers to support the system was uniformly applicable to all, except as the state legislature explicitly provided otherwise, and nothing in the code excluded churches.</SPAN></P>

He then filed an appeal with the trial court and a motion for an evidentiary hearing, which was dismissed and overruled, respectively. The employee then sought review of the trial court's decision, claiming that he was not given adequate notice of the charges nor an opportunity to confront and cross-examine his accusers. On appeal, the court held that the failure to include in the original letter evidence supporting the charges was cured by the explicit and direct evidence adduced at the referee's hearing, coupled with cross-examination there and the opportunity provided to him to adduce additional evidence before the commission. The court found that the employee's own witnesses testified as to loan sharking of such a dimension that his claimed ignorance thereof so faulted his supervision that nonfeasance was established by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant could not raise the issue that &sect; 2925.01(E)(6), defining bulk amount as a mixture containing any amount of the substance, was unconstitutionally vague because his admission by his no contest plea did not require any evidence to show that the dosage was more than grams of LSD.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court determined that actually the sole issue before the trial court was whether the clients owed the law firm money on account of fees for legal service rendered. The court found that the law firm's affidavits were complete, extensive and in proper form while those of the clients were rambling and did not rise to a level of acceptable evidence or proof.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant initially pled not guilty to the charges of loitering and disorderly conduct. She filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that Akron, Ohio, Mun. Ordinance No. 648.14(A)(1) was unconstitutional. The municipal court denied her motion to dismiss. Defendant entered a no contest plea and was found guilty and sentenced by the municipal court. On appeal, the court held that Akron, Ohio, Mun. Ordinance No. 648.14(A)(1) was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The court ruled that Akron, Ohio, Mun. Ordinance No. 648.14(a)(1) provided a clear standard by which a person could conform his conduct and provided sufficiently definite guidelines for its enforcement by police. Further, because Akron, Ohio, Mun. Ordinance No. 648.14(a)(1) required an overt, physical act to justify an arrest, it precluded an arrest of a known prostitute or panderer on the basis of loitering alone. The court found that the municipal court did not err in finding defendant guilty because the facts in the complaint, to which defendant admitted by pleading no contest, were sufficient to establish her guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant newspaper and reporter appealed the decision from the Common Pleas Court of Lake County, Ohio, which entered a judgment in favor of plaintiff, the subject of a newspaper article (subject), in his libel suit. An article was published about a drug arrest involving the subject's son. The newspaper and the reporter contended that the article was true, that there was no actual malice, and that the subject did not suffer actual damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The subject's son was arrested on drug charges. The subject and his son had the same names except for the middle initial. Government officials provided information that drug money had been funneled into businesses owned by the subject. The subject claimed that his business was harmed by the article, which imputed the son's actions to him since it did not differentiate the subject's name from the son's. On appeal, the court agreed in large part with the newspaper and the reporter. A plaintiff could no longer rely on the doctrine of libel per se. A plaintiff had to prove the publication of a false statement and actual injury and fault by the publisher. The facts as told by government officials were true. Under the &quot;neutral reportage&quot; rule, the article was protected by the First Amendment since it was not published with actual malice. A failure to conduct a greater investigation and find out that the subject was not the son was not actual malice. The reporter was not negligent in failing to conduct a greater investigation. The subject did not show actual injury caused by the allegedly libelous article. The business could have lost profits for any number of reasons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court erred in not entering a judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of the newspaper and the reporter. Judgment was thereby entered for the newspaper and the reporter. Nine of the assignments of error were sustained. The subject did not establish a libelous publication under the new rules concerning libel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found the order of appellee was supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence and was in accordance with law. The facility argued that the trial court erred in finding that the license revocation order that was not supported by findings of fact or conclusions of law was lawful and valid. The facility failed to show any prejudice by the manner in which the hearing examiner made his findings of facts. There was also ample evidence in the record to support the Director's decision to revoke the license of the operator of the facility. The court agreed with the trial court's determination that disclosed that the hearing before the hearing examiner did not constitute a &quot;sham&quot; or deny the facility due process of law. The record disclosed that the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.09 were followed at the adjudication hearing. The court found substantial justice had been done the party complaining.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 5717.04 from a decision and order of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, in which the board affirmed a sales and use tax assessment levied against it by appellee tax commissioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer argued that the purchase of the particular items in dispute was for use directly in making retail sales within the exemption provided by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.01(E). The board found that the three types of items involved in the disputed purchase transactions, the projectors used to show the filmstrips, the &quot;master&quot; film from which the filmstrips used by salesmen were reproduced, and the reproduced filmstrips actually used by the salesmen, did not qualify for the exemption provided by &sect; 5739.01(E), (P), and were correctly dealt with by the Tax Commissioner. The court found that the projector and reproduced filmstrips were then used by the salesmen in a direct confrontation with the customer to demonstrate the utility or superiority of the product offered for sale. Thus, it held that the items were exempt as items used directly in making retail sales within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.01(E)(2), (P). However, the court agreed with the determination as to the master film not being exempt. It was produced and retained in its out-of-state location. Its use and consumption were not, therefore, &quot;direct,&quot; within the scope of &sect; 5739.01(E)(2), (P).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decision and order was affirmed as to that portion of the tax assessment applicable to the taxpayer's purchase of the master film, and reversed as to that portion of the tax assessment applicable to the taxpayer's purchase of the projectors and the reproduced filmstrips.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed from the judgment of the Common Pleas Court, County of Lorain (Ohio), which convicted them for violations of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants included individuals actively engaged in the real estate business, a county Director of Community Development, and a county Service Director. The indictments related to the relocation of individuals displaced by urban renewal and to the rehabilitation of homes using federal grants. Defendants argued that upon circumstantial evidence which failed to exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence and upon which no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial court erroneously denied motions for judgment of acquittal. One defendant who was engaged in the real estate business argued that the evidence was insufficient to support her convictions on charges of grand theft and having an unlawful interest in a public contract. The court agreed and held that there was no evidence that she was a public official, or that two other defendants had an interest in the property at issue, or in the public contract, or that another defendant was one of their business associates. There was no evidence connecting either defendant with the transaction except that a buyer notified one defendant she had chosen the property.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the record contained sufficient evidence, including defendants' admission as to ownership and agency, to warrant the trial court's finding that defendants owned and operated the rental units, were subject to the housing code, and failed to comply with the code's requirements. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 19 because it was enacted for the health, safety, and welfare of its inhabitants.

The court found that &sect; 1333.92, was not vague because it was precisely worded in a fashion that would be commonly understood by men of common intelligence. Nonetheless, the court held that &sect; 1333.92 was unconstitutionally overbroad.

The trial court assigned ownership of the marital property and also awarded a lump sum award of alimony to appellee that was ordered to be paid over seven years. Appellant had interest in eight partnerships and he argued that the trial court improperly exercised jurisdiction over the partnerships and their assets in making the alimony award. The court held that the trial court did not order any disposition nor assignment to appellee of any partnership assets. Rather, the matter of appellant's discharge of his obligation under the decree was to be handled in any way that he should determine. The trial court did not exercise jurisdiction over appellant's partnership assets or any of the partners and neither the partners, nor the partnerships were necessary parties to that lawsuit. The division of the property ordered by the trial court was not in error as a matter of law. The record was replete with documents on which to base such a determination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a medical malpractice action by an injured minor against a hospital, the court determined that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B) denied equal protection of the law. The court found that &sect; 2305.11(B) tolled the statute of limitations either at age 10 or age 13 depending upon the age of the minor at the time of injury so that the one-year limitation period of &sect; 2305.11(A) began to run at age 13 for medical claims occurring under that age, but at age 18 for other malpractice claims. The injured minor sought both a rehearing en banc and reconsideration. The court denied both motions. The court determined that a rehearing en banc was precluded by Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 3(A). The court found that the prior opinion only held that it was not a violation of the equal protection clause to have different statutes of limitation and tolling provisions as to medical malpractice claims and other negligence claims. Because the issues raised in this case concerning the treatment of minors and medical malpractice claims versus other malpractice claims were different from the issues raised in the prior opinion, the court concluded that there was no inconsistency warranting reconsideration.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the public employment was not fundamental in an equal protection context.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the decision that convicted and sentenced defendant of voluntary manslaughter. Defendant was at the time of the offense and of the trial a juvenile. Defendant argued that evidence existed that defendant would have been amenable to further care as a juvenile and that legal restraint was not required. The court found that defendant had a record as a juvenile delinquent and there was concrete evidence as to defendant's lack of response to various types of juvenile care. At the time of the offense defendant was on parole from the Ohio youth commission. At the hearing on probable cause it was established that defendant had violated his curfew and had carried a loaded revolver, a direct refutation of any contention defendant was responsive to the efforts of the youth commission. From this evidence it could reasonably be concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe that defendant was not readily brought to yield, submit or be responsive to treatment as a juvenile delinquent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal from the trial court's decision, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.03(B) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.04(C) were not unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The State of Ohio had a legitimate interest in protecting and fostering the moral and physical well-being of its children. It was an adequate safeguard to the parents' due process rights in a dependency determination that the allegation of harmful environment had to be supported by particular facts. Further, the court held that the trial court did not err in admitting evidence based upon the best interest of the child at the adjudicatory hearing. Once a child had been found to be &quot;dependent,&quot; the best interests of the child were the primary consideration in determining whether an award of permanent custody was justified pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.353(D). There was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's findings that the child was neglected and that her best interests would be served by awarding her permanent custody to the county children services board for adoptive placement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State alleged that defendant, an auxiliary police officer, kidnapped and twice raped a prostitute. A jury found defendant guilty as charged. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court's application of the rape-shield statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(D), did not infringe defendant's constitutional right to confrontation. Here, consent was not at issue because defendant denied having any sexual relations with the victim. Because the victim admitted that she was a prostitute, she was impeached. The trial court exercised its sound discretion in concluding that further inquiries into the victim's past sexual activities would not have served the purposes of impeachment, because such inquiries would have revealed only what the jury already knew. Any evidence presented in this regard would have been inflammatory and prejudicial, as well as cumulative. Moreover, because the State did not make any inquiries into the victim's past sexual activities, it did not waive the limitations of &sect; 2907.02(D). Further, because defendant denied any sexual contact with the victim, he was not entitled to a jury instruction on the lesser-included offense of sexual battery.</SPAN></P>

The owner died as a result of his injuries. Defendant one did not testify at the trial. Defendant two testified that he was home with his mother when the robbery occurred. A third defendant was convicted in a separate trial, but his confession was allowed into evidence against defendants when he refused to testify during their trial. The jury found defendants guilty as charged. Defendants appealed. The court held that the trial court erred in allowing the third defendant's confession to be read into evidence. In view of the other strong evidence against defendants, it was difficult to understand the prosecution's use of this stratagem. Despite the serious nature of the crimes, the court could not treat the error as harmless because of the highly prejudicial nature of the third defendant's confession and the total lack of confrontation of its contents. The unnecessary zealousness of the prosecution and errors of the trial court in regard to this testimony necessitated a reversal of defendants' convictions and a remand for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for the murder of a victim by use of a shotgun under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.02 after arguing with the victim's son. Defendant had argued with the son while each talked on a citizens-band radio. Defendant then arrived at the victim's house with the loaded shotgun, brandishing his weapon first. The trial court instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter but denied the requested instruction on negligent homicide. The court affirmed on appeal, finding no error. Defendant had pled self-defense, thus admitting that the shooting was purposeful. Thus, there was no entitlement to an instruction on negligent homicide. The court next found that placing the burden of proof on defendant to show self-defense under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(A) was constitutional. Finally, the court found that sufficient evidence supported the jury's verdict. The various witnesses gave conflicting reports of the shooting but all agreed that defendant showed the first weapon. Consequently, the elements of self-defense were not proved.</SPAN></P>

The evidence was stipulated, and defendant agreed that there was a duty of support and that the duty had been breached. The court found that defendant was not denied any of his due process rights under the United States or Ohio Constitutions because there was a rational nexus between the statute and state policy in providing criminal sanctions for the non-support of minor children. The court emphasized that paternity was not an issue in the case; that, by choosing not to appeal the decision of the juvenile court, defendant waived his right to attack the determination of paternity in the criminal non-support action; and that it was not error to allow the prior civil determination of paternity to be admitted into evidence for the purpose of proving duty to support. The court found that, although defendant was indigent and was not afforded a blood test, there was no equal protection violation because he was not entitled to attack the issue of paternity in the criminal non-support action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After he was released on his own recognizance, defendant failed to appear at trial. Upon his surrender, defendant was tried for violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2937.29, 2937.99. In his defense, defendant contended that his appearance at trial would have resulted in a fatal heart attack. In support of this claim, the defense presented the expert testimony of a psychiatrist. An audiotape of the defense's preparation of the psychiatrist contained several disparaging comments by the defense in regard to defendant. The trial court allowed the prosecution to listen to the tape before its cross-examination of the psychiatrist. A jury subsequently found defendant guilty as charged. Defendant appealed, contending that the trial court should not have allowed the prosecution to use the tape in preparation for its cross-examination of the psychiatrist. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the trial court committed prejudicial error because, under Ohio R. Evid. 403(A), the probative value of the tape was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to defendant. Thus, defendant was deprived of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the limitation accrued to defendant's prejudice, noting that the record reflected a sharp conflict between the evidence on the crucial issues of force and consent. Moreover, the court found that the trial court had erred by failing to issue a prompt curative instruction regarding the prosecutor's closing argument, in which the prosecutor suggested that the State's evidence was &quot;uncontradicted.&quot; Noting that the comment was an improper allusion to defendant's failure to take the stand in his own defense, the court found that the trial court's failure to promptly admonish the jury regarding the prosecutor's comments constituted prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

A jury found defendant guilty of refusing to pay the county welfare department the reasonable costs of maintaining his two children in violation of &sect; 3113.06 and sentenced defendant to a state reformatory. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, holding that &sect; 3113.06 was constitutional. The statute did not violate Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 15, which prohibited imprisonment for a debt in a civil action because defendant had been convicted and sentenced for the violation of a criminal statute and the support for one's dependents was a duty imposed by law as opposed to a civil debt. Furthermore, the state did not have the burden of showing that defendant was able to make reimbursement payments by virtue of his property, earnings, or labor because such a burden was unreasonable where the information the state would have needed to prove such ability to pay was either protected by privacy laws or protected by defendant's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners brought an challenging the assessments made against their properties for certain street improvements. When the trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment, the owners sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment in part and remanded to the trial court. The court found that the city had acted arbitrarily and unreasonably by calculating the assessments on the basis of front-footage, rather than on the basis of a proportional benefit analysis, the method cited in the assessment's enabling ordinance. Noting that the owners were entitled to an accurate assessment equal to the benefit to each owner's individual property, the court found that the city's failure to abide by the enabling ordinance required that the matter be remanded to the trial court. The court found, however, that the trial court's error in granting summary judgment had only prejudiced those owners who had objected to the assessment within the time period mandated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 727.15. Therefore, the court reversed the judgment only as to those owners who had filed their objections in a timely manner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs and defendants claimed ownership in the oil and gas under two independent chains of title. Plaintiffs brought the suit asking that title to the oil and gas be quieted against the claims of defendants and requesting partition of the oil and gas interests. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, and defendants appealed. The court held that: (1) the Ohio Marketable Title Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5301.47 et seq., applied to mineral interests except coal; (2) the key to determining the rights of the parties where there were independent unbroken chains of title was the date of the root title of each contestant; (3) the interest derived from plaintiffs' older root of title, not having been preserved according to law, expired, and defendants' most recently recorded &quot;wild&quot; root of title prevailed; and (4) the Act was constitutional because it was not retroactive as the grace period after the Act became applicable to mineral interests was three years and two weeks, which gave plaintiffs ample time to file a notice, and because there was a rational basis for discrimination between coal and other mineral interests.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was threatened into manufacturing controlled substances. When the police were transporting defendant, the police officer told defendant that he was going to take defendant's statement later. Defendant then admitted that he was guilty. Defendant claimed that he acted under duress and that his statement to the police was inadmissible because he was not given his Miranda warnings. The court held that the conviction was proper. Defendant's statement was admissible because he was not being interrogated when he made the statement. Defendant properly had the burden to prove duress, especially where duress was an avoidance in that defendant admitted that he committed the crime. Section 2925.03(A)(3) was not vague because it clearly defined what conduct was illegal. The facts asserted in the search warrant created probable cause to believe that defendant had controlled substances in the laboratory. The trial court's failure to admit defendant's excited utterance that he committed the crime under duress was harmless error given that the evidence was cumulative and that defendant was no longer threatened because those who had threatened him were incarcerated.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that the witnesses were competent pursuant to Ohio R. Evid. 601(A) because they exhibited an ability to testify as to factual impressions and the importance of having told the truth. Therefore, the trial court did not exceed its discretion when it determined that the witnesses were competent. There was sufficient evidence to show that the children were less than 10 years of age based on the testimony of defendant, the mother, the children, and what grades the children were in school. There was sufficient, though conflicting evidence, of defendant's guilt. The State was not entitled to appeal the trial court's having dismissed the rape charges against defendant because legal jeopardy attached when the jury was sworn in. Because the dismissal was based on evidence available to the State and the State's appeal would have violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution and Ohio Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was the owner of a skating rink. The neighbors complained that the music from the rink constituted a disturbance of the peace to the neighborhood, pursuant to &sect; 910-9. The court held that &sect; 910-9 was unconstitutional because it was vague. The court reasoned that for the penal statute to be valid, it had to sufficiently define its terms so as to put defendant on notice of the proscribed conduct. Because &sect; 910-9 used the term &quot;neighborhood,&quot; which was not defined, &sect; 910-9 was void because it was too vague under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court noted that neighborhood could have meant a set of city blocks, a set of people, or even people within earshot of the noise. The penalty of $ 100 was valid, though it was more than the amount prescribed in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 715.56, because the two laws were consistent with each other. There was sufficient evidence that the noise was disturbing the peace, though the testimony was in conflict.

Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11 and entering summary judgment in favor of defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The infant argued the trial court erred (1) in concluding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11 as amended July 28, 1975 applied to a medical malpractice claim which accrued before the statute was amended; and (2) in holding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11 barred his claims because the statute, whether retroactive or not, was unconstitutional. After July 28, 1975, the tolling provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16 were no longer applicable to medical malpractice cases. However, the amendment allowed for persons who had not attained the age of 10 at the time the amendment went into effect to bring suit any time up to their 14 birthday. Unfortunately, the infant brought his suit six months after he reached 14. Further, the court found that the amended statute operated prospectively rather than retroactively; thus, it was valid as against any claim of unconstitutional retroactive application under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, or of any invalidity under the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58. The court found that the trial court properly entered summary judgment in favor of the doctor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee brought an action to recover damages as a result of asbestos exposure. The trial court granted the manufacturers' motions for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint on grounds that the two-year statute of limitations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.10 barred the action. On review, the court reversed, finding that (1) the employee's cause of action accrued no later than his last exposure to the asbestos products that were manufactured by defendants; (2) the legislature did not provide for the retroactive application of the newly enacted discovery rule statute of limitations in &sect; 2305.10 and the trial court could not give retroactive application to the statute of limitations; and (3) summary judgment was erroneous because one manufacturer failed to file an answer and there was a genuine issue of material fact as to the actual date of the employee's last exposure to asbestos.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the Hamilton County Municipal Court (Ohio), which convicted him of driving a truck with a load in excess of the weight limits established by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5577.04. The uniform traffic ticket used to lodge the complaint charged defendant with a violation of subsection (C) of &sect; 5577.04. Defendant asserted that &sect; 5577.04 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statute under which defendant was charged had undergone a number of revisions throughout the years but had always regulated the maximum load or weight that could be carried by certain vehicles. In December of 1978, when defendant was charged, &sect; 5577.04 contained no subsection (C). Such a subsection had apparently existed prior to August of 1978 but the contents of that subsection had then been divided up and transferred to a number of different portions of the statute. The record contained no indication that the common pleas court had considered or ruled on the validity of the complaint charging defendant under the nonexistent subsection or that counsel for defendant had objected to the charge. On appeal, the court stated that it was axiomatic that a complaint not charging an offense is void. The court held that the irregularity in the complaint could not be disregarded simply because no objection to it was seasonably made at the trial level. The court concluded that the conviction and judgment below were void. Because it was able to dispose of the case on other grounds, the court found it unnecessary to consider defendant's constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the municipal court and discharged defendant.</SPAN></P>

The police retrieved the package and discovered it was a purse containing cigar tubes filled with various pills, including Talwin. Defendant was found guilty of drug abuse and the court affirmed his conviction. It found that although there was no express statutory listing for Talwin in the drug schedule in the Ohio Revised Code, it was added to the Ohio Controlled Substance Schedule IV by the drug being placed on the Federal Controlled Substance Schedule IV. Further, the law granting the automatic addition of the drug to the Ohio schedules was not an unconstitutional delegation of authority to the United States Attorney General. The court also found that no reasonable theory of innocence was established, as defendant was seen dropping the purse, officers immediately discovered the purse containing drugs, no other object or person was in the vicinity where the object was dropped, and defendant did not produce evidence constituting a credible theory of innocence.</SPAN></P>

He and the officers proceeded to argue about who would tow the truck. The officers argued that they should tow the truck because the license plate tags on the truck were expired. Defendant expressed his desire tow the truck in order to save the towing charge. Defendant then told one of the officers that he was not fit to wear a uniform. Defendant was immediately arrested. Defendant admitted that he drank two beers while he was in town scouting up help. Defendant was convicted of disorderly conduct. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction and concluded that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11 was unconstitutional as applied to defendant. The court found that defendant was arrested for his speech. The court further found that the trial court erred because defendant was not present at the sentencing and judgment.</SPAN></P>

Defendants claimed that the classification of cocaine as a schedule II narcotic violated their substantive due process rights and subjected them to cruel and unusual punishment, and that the Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The class asserted that it was error to find that they did not have a right to counsel at internal investigative disciplinary proceedings, that promotions within the State Highway Patrol had to be made pursuant to the civil service laws rather than at the discretion of the Superintendent, and that they were entitled to compensation for the time they spend conditioning for their jobs and testing their conditioning. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the cause. The court opined that pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The court concluded that promotions for the State Highway Patrol members were to be made pursuant to &sect; 124.18, which gave the Superintendent discretion, rather than the general civil service statutes,&nbsp;Ohio Rev.

The court found that the identification procedures utilized by the police were overly suggestive and the in-court identification testimony of one of the State's witnesses was not sufficiently independent of her prior identification at the lineup. However, the court found that the other witness's description to the police, before the lineup procedure, was much more exact and, thus, was not tainted by the suggestive lineup procedure utilized by the police. The court also pointed out that the trial court's paraphrasing of a witness's testimony in response to a question by the jury was error, but in this case it was harmless, as the answers provided by the court were substantially the same as the witness's testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company operated an ordinary land-fill on their property located within Jackson Township.

However, the company's landfill operation was protected as a prior non-conforming use. Thereafter, the company decided to add a hazardous waste disposal facility. The company filed its declaratory action when it encountered legal problems with regard to the waste disposal facility. While the action was pending, the legislature established an amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3734.05, which provided for state control of hazardous waste facility installation. On appeal, the trustees argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3734.05(D)(3) was unconstitutional as it applied to municipalities. The court held that a municipalities' police powers conferred by Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3 were limited if the regulations were in conflict with general laws. Next, the court held that the trustees' police powers were in fact limited because their zoning ordinance interfered with Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, including the city, brought an action in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction against defendant trustees from interfering with the city's right to extend service to the territory and inhabitants set forth in two annexation ordinances. The trustees appealed from the trial court's decision ratifying the annexation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court entered a judgment denying trustees' counterclaim for a mandatory injunction directing plaintiffs to certify the annexation ordinances to the board of elections for referendum and granted plaintiffs a permanent injunction prohibiting the trustees from interfering with the city's providing all municipal services to the territory and inhabitants affected by the ordinances. On the trustees' appeal, the court stated that, generally, election statutes were mandatory and had to be strictly complied with. In any city which had adopted a charter containing initiative and referendum provisions and such provisions were reasonable and not in contravention of constitutional provisions relating thereto, such procedure had to be followed in preparing and filing an initiative or referendum petition. The court held that the record indicated that the appropriate petition forms were not used. Further, the final text of the ordinance sought to be considered was not embodied within nor attached to the petition forms which were implemented. The court held that the petitions under consideration were violative of the city charter and that, therefore, the referendum process never began.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in denying a directed verdict of acquittal, in failing to instruct the jury about lesser offenses of involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide, and in instructing the jury that the defense had the burden of proving he acted in self-defense. The court held that the prosecution adduced evidence sufficient for the jury to conclude that defendant knowingly caused the death of the victim. A directed verdict of acquittal was not proper because reasonable minds could have found each of the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, the court held that the trial court did not err by refusing to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter. Since conviction of involuntary manslaughter required proof of an essential element which was not an essential element of murder, involuntary manslaughter was not a lesser included offense of murder. It was also not error for the trial court to refuse to instruct the jury on negligent homicide, because negligent homicide was not a lesser included offense of murder. Finally, the court held that defendant properly had the burden of proof in regard to self-defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which entered a jury verdict convicting him of possession of quaaludes in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(6). Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying him the requisite standing to seek suppression of contested evidence, and that the mandatory statutory sentence that was imposed violated the court's inherent sentencing powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of his conviction and sentence for his violation of &sect; 2925.03, based upon the seizure of quaaludes in his parents' apartment. The trial court overruled defendant's motion to suppress the drug evidence seized on the grounds that defendant lacked standing to challenge the search of that apartment. On appeal, defendant asserted that he should have been accorded the requisite standing to seek suppression of the drug evidence in response to prosecutorial claims that he criminally possessed the drugs found. Defendant's other contention was that the sentencing provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2925 constituted a legislative usurpation of the inherent judicial power to execute judgments and sentences. The court on appeal affirmed the trial court's judgment based on its determination that (1) defendant failed to establish that the search of his parents' apartment was illegal, and that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in their apartment; and (2) there was a rational basis on which the legislature based its sentencing structure for drug violations, and defendant's offense was determined to merit a mandatory period of actual incarceration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant insurance company sought review of an order from the Medina Municipal Court (Ohio), which found it liable to appellee towing company for storage and towing charges of an abandoned vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police discovered a damaged vehicle and ordered the towing company to tow it. An investigation revealed that the vehicle was stolen however the owner of the car was never notified of the vehicle's recovery. The vehicle's title was transferred to the insurance company. The insurance company was later notified of the vehicle's recovery. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4513. 61 did not apply to stolen vehicles, as there was no intent to abandon on the part of the owner. A law enforcement officer had no authority to bind the owner of a stolen vehicle for towing and storage costs in the recovery of the car. There was no lien on the vehicle because the vehicle was unlawfully detained. The trial court improperly refused to enter an order for replevin on constitutional grounds because there was nothing constitutionally objectionable for a judge, after a hearing upon the merits, to order property returned to its rightful owner by a writ of replevin. The trial court could have found that an implied contract existed from the time the insurance company made a demand on the towing company for release of the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed that part of the municipal court's decision that related to the judgment in favor of the towing company, and reversed that part of the judgment that related to the amount of the judgment in favor of the towing company and the denial of the insurance company's request for replevin.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas, Franklin County (Ohio) convicting him of one count of possession of phencyclidine (PCP) in an amount equal to or exceeding the bulk amount and in an amount less than three times that amount, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03. Defendant was also convicted of one count of knowingly obtaining, possessing, or using methaqualone, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant maintained that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion to suppress evidence because the search warrant was not based on probable cause and the command portion of the warrant did not permit a search of defendant's person. The court found that the search warrant affidavit was based on sufficient probable cause in that the hearsay of a confidential informant met the two-prong test of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in the Aguilar precedent and had adequate indicia of reliability. Further, the court rejected defendant's contention that the chain of possession of two State exhibits admitted into evidence had not been established because the record indicated that the exhibits had been sufficiently identified for purposes of being admitted into evidence and the issue of the chain of custody thus related to the weight to be accorded the exhibits. There was sufficient evidence that the packets of street drugs contained &quot;a unit dose&quot; as defined by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.01(F).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants moved a mobile home onto their auto sales lot in order to discourage the multiple burglaries that had been taking place. One defendant, the employee, lived in the mobile home. The village prosecuted the action as a violation of the ordinance prohibiting any new or moved mobile homes. The court reversed the convictions, finding first that the village ordinances were not unconstitutional. This was because the terms &quot;mobile home&quot; and &quot;house trailer&quot; had statutory definitions that were clear. The court also found that the prohibition of new or moved mobile homes was a proper exercise of local legislative power. However, the court agreed with defendants that the village discriminated in its enforcement, thus violating the Equal Protection Clause. Other business owners kept mobile homes as offices and none were arrested. The court then held that defendants had put forward sufficient evidence to show that the mobile home was incidental to the commercial use of their commercially zoned property. The village had not proved otherwise and could not prevent defendants' actions.</SPAN></P>

Twenty months after the action was filed, the prejudgment attachment procedure used in courts of common pleas pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2715 was declared unconstitutional. Pursuant to that decision, the debtor unsuccessfully sought to dismiss or dissolve the creditor's order of attachment against it. On appeal, the court reversed the municipal court's judgment against the debtor by finding error in the municipal court's failure to indicate the statutory authority for its action or the basis for its decision, the absence of findings of fact and conclusions of law of the original judge, the failure of the original judge or a properly designated judge to sign the judgment entry for the creditor, and the misplacement of any reliance by the municipal court upon the unconstitutional procedure in &sect; 2715 in entering judgment against the debtor.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court's erroneous jury instructions on the uncharged crime of conspiracy were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, noting that the trial court had instructed the jury to ignore the erroneous charge and had promptly issued a curative instruction. The court rejected defendant's constitutional challenge to the complicity statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 4123.60, and the court denied her petition for a writ of mandamus. The court held that it was not free to overrule a prior decision of the Ohio Supreme Court which determined that payment could be made for either survivor's benefits under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.59 or for payments due to the deceased worker prior to his death, but not both, depending on the circumstances. The court refused to substitute its judgment for that of the Ohio Supreme Court on the issue of whether this was a proper or reasonable interpretation of the statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The students claimed the university's brochure contained false representations about the university's medical school. When the university refused to return the students' fees, tuition, and expenses, the students brought a breach of contract action against the university. After refusing to discharge a prejudgment attachment of the university's accounts, the trial court granted the students summary judgment, and the university sought review. In reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the court initially noted that the trial court had been precluded from considering any documentary evidence of a type not enumerated within Ohio R. Civ. P. 56(C). In finding summary judgment erroneous, the court considered the cognizable documents and found unresolved issues of fact, including: (1) whether the representations were false; (2) whether the students were deceived by any representations; and if so, (3) whether any of those representations were material to the contract or to the students' expenditures. The court also held that the statutes authorizing prejudgment attachment had been declared unconstitutional and that the declaration of unconstitutionality had a retroactive effect.</SPAN></P>

Both defendants were convicted on three separate counts of felonious assault directed against the individual and against the first defendant's ex-wife and daughter, who were witnesses to the argument. On appeal, the first defendant contended that his conduct of firing three shots in quick succession from the moving vehicle was one sequence of events. The court held that there was arguably a probability that his conduct could have caused harm to the witnesses besides the individual who were within range of his gunfire. However, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.11 required separate animus for multiple counts of the same offense. There was no evidence that the first defendant had any motive to harm his ex-wife and daughter. The second defendant participated in the crime and was properly convicted of felonious assault as an aider and abettor of the first defendant. However, because the first defendant, as the principal, was convicted of only one count, the second defendant could likewise be convicted of only one count, pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The trial court reviewed the record and affirmed the order of the director. The trial court overruled the nursing home's motion for reconsideration. Contending that it was not accorded a hearing pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 119.02, the nursing home appealed. On appeal, the court held that (1) there was no conflict between C.P.

Defendant chose not to testify. However, he cross-examined the prosecution witnesses and presented his own witness on the issue of self-defense. The jury was properly instructed that defendant had a constitutional right not to testify and that his exercise of that right was not to be considered for any purpose. The jury instructions, considered as a whole, did not compromise defendant's right to remain silent but preserved and protected the right.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was one of 17 co-defendants indicted for engaging in organized crime. Defendant pled not guilty to the indictment and moved for an order dismissing the indictment on the ground that Ohio Rev.

Defendant later retracted his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of guilty of attempted engaging in organized crime as a lesser and included offense under the charge of the indictment. The trial court accepted defendant's plea. On review, the court reversed the judgment. Subsequent to the judgment rendered by the trial court, the Ohio Supreme Court addressed the issue raised by defendant as to whether the statute of engaging in organized crime set forth sufficiently ascertainable standards of guilt so as to comport with the requirements of due process. The Ohio Supreme Court struck down the statute as unconstitutionally void for vagueness. Defendant's plea of factual guilt to attempting to engage in organized crime did not preclude the vacation of final judgment necessitated by virtue of the adjudication of the unconstitutionality of the operative penal statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was in the business of solid waste disposal. The county board of health required defendant to annually obtain a registration certificate indicating that his equipment met the requirements for such a business. The requirements under Wayne County, Ohio, Health Reg. 98 included the inspection of disposal trucks by the health commissioner. Upon application for his certificate, defendant was informed that the health commissioner was also requiring the trucks to be safety inspected by the state highway patrol. Defendant refused the inspection and was charged with violating the regulation. On review, the court reversed the judgment. Nothing in the regulation required such an inspection. Furthermore, nothing in the regulation empowered the commissioner to make additional requirements. The office of health commissioner was clearly one of enforcement of regulations rather than the creation of regulations. Therefore, the commissioner was without authority to require a safety inspection by the highway patrol as no enabling legislation permitted him to order the inspection. Since defendant had complied with the regulations, he should have been issued a permit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the operator and the owner of a home for troubled youth, challenged the decision of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granting declaratory and injunctive relief in favor of appellee township trustees in the trustees' action to enjoin appellants from operating the home on property zoned A-1, Agricultural.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The group home was operated on a 10-acre tract zoned for agricultural uses. The stated purpose of the home was to provide surrogate family care for troubled youth. The staff consisted of a program director and four additional adults working in shifts so that 24-hour supervision would be maintained. The staff and residents shared in household chores and meal preparation. On appeal, the court held that the home qualified as a charitable institution because the home's operator was a nonprofit corporation organized to provide care for troubled youth and the organization had received tax exempt status from the United States Internal Revenue Service as an entity organized and operated for charitable purposes under I.R.C. &sect; 501(C)(3). The operation of the home constituted a permissible semi-public use under the A-1 classification in Freedom Township, Ohio, Zoning Resol. art. VI, &sect; I. A. 2 and 3. The home met the technical requirements of the definitions of &quot;dwelling&quot; and &quot;single-family dwelling&quot; as set forth in Freedom Township, Ohio, Zoning Resol. art. IV, nos. 21,22, and the residents maintained a common household.</SPAN></P>

In all other respects, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed. The court rendered, in part, the judgment that the trial court should have rendered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city appealed a decision by the Cuyahoga Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which entered judgment for plaintiff landowner in the landowner's suit that sought declaratory relief against the city to have a commercial building and parking lot located on his property be declared a prior nonconforming use. The city counterclaimed for an injunction against the continued use of one of the parcels for violating zoning ordinances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both U.S. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 1, and Ohio Const. art. 1, &sect; 16 guaranteed the right of a landowner to continue a lawful, prior nonconforming use. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 713.15 limited the power of the city to regulate existing uses of property through the enactment of zoning ordinances. Parma, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 1181.02(a), (b) defined the circumstances in which a pre-existing nonconforming use would be considered abandoned and no longer valid. The landowner purchased the property in 1948. He obtained a permit to build a restaurant in 1952. In 1954, the property was rezoned for two-family residential use, and it was again rezoned in 1973 for single-family residences. The court determined that the landowner had established his parking lot prior to 1954 and that he had continuously maintained it without abandonment so as to make his use a prior nonconforming use. The trial court's finding was not against the weight of the evidence, and most of the evidence adduced by the city was circumstantial. For example, the city implied that, if weeds grew on the lot, it could not have been used for parking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the Board found that the pharmacist had failed to properly maintain prescription records and had overcharged the Department of Public Welfare, the Board ordered the suspension of his license. The trial court reversed the order on the grounds that &sect; 4729.16(A) was unconstitutional and that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4729.37 did not specify the manner of the disposition of prescription records. The Board appealed, and the court reversed in part, holding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4729.16(A) should be properly interpreted to mean that the Board could impose sanctions upon a finding that the pharmacist had been properly &quot;convicted of a felony in a court of law.&quot; Further, since the pharmacist was not found guilty of a felony in a court of law, the Board lacked authority to suspend his license under &sect; 4729.16(A). The court affirmed the judgment in part, holding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4729.37 was constitutional and that it mandated that where a pharmacy ceases its operation, possession of its prescriptions remains with the pharmacist who filled them or his successors and said possession must be retained for a period of three years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the portion of the judgment that found that the pharmacist violated state statutes by failing to properly maintain prescription records, but it reversed the portion of the judgment that found the statutes to be facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision by the Wayne County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which revoked his probation. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in failing to provide a written statement of the evidence and reasons relied on in revoking his probation. He also contended that the trial court erred in considering his alleged violation of a condition of probation that prohibited association with a named person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court found that the trial court's journal entry ordering the revocation was inadequate to meet the requirement of a written statement setting for the evidence relied on and the reasons for revoking the probation. However, defendant was not denied due process because, in his case, an explanation was provided at the conclusion of the hearing and in the presence of defendant. The explanation was transcribed in the record of proceedings. The court next found that the trial court did not err in considering defendant's alleged violations of the association rules as a basis for revocation. The trial court had great discretion in setting the conditions of probation, and the condition had a reasonable relationship with the goals of probation and the protection of a public. Defendant was seen doing more than saying &quot;hi&quot; to the prohibited associate. Nor did the trial court err in overruling defendant's motion to dismiss because the evidence presented by the State was not of such an insubstantial nature that the denial constituted reversible error. The revocation hearing was not a formal trial, and the trial court had broad discretionary power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The broker failed to pay the complainant a commission for a real estate transaction. The broker's refusal to pay the commission was based on the losses that the construction company, which the broker co-owned, sustained on the project. The complainant filed a complaint with the real estate division of the state department of commerce for the broker's failure to pay. The commission adopted a hearing officer's finding that although the broker was not guilty of the allegations made by the complainant, he was guilty of misconduct because his dual role as broker and builder had led to the complainant not being paid the commission and suspended the broker's license for 30 days. The trial court affirmed the commission's ruling. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that: (1) the term misconduct was adequately defined in Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 1301:5-3-08, thus, it was not so vague as to have violated the broker's Due Process rights; (2) there was substantial evidence to support the commission's order; (3) the notice provided to the broker of the charges was sufficient to apprise him of the wrongful conduct; and (4) the appellate court was without authority to impose a lesser penalty.</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed the Commission's order that suspended the real estate broker's license for 30 days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The broker was a partner in a construction company. His salesman procured buyers to enter a contract with the company to build a home. When the company lost money on the contract, it refused to pay the salesman a commission. The salesman complained to the Commission. A hearing examiner ruled that the broker was guilty of misconduct because his dual role as broker and builder led to the salesman's failure to receive a commission. The Commission suspended the broker's real estate license. The trial court found that the order was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. On appeal, the court held that the term &quot;misconduct&quot; in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4735.18(F) was not so vague as to violate due process and the broker was on notice that he could not neglect his duty to his employee in order to benefit himself. Though the maintenance of the dual roles of broker and builder was not in itself misconduct, his failure to fulfill both roles properly led to sanctions. While the court believed a lesser penalty could have been justified, it had no authority to modify the Commission's order because it was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a township, sought review of a judgment from the Common Pleas Court of Pickaway County (Ohio), which dismissed their declaratory judgment action against defendants, a park district and the Attorney General, to determine that the park district had no extraterritorial power of eminent domain, that the park district's tax exemption was unconstitutional, and that the park district was not immune from local zoning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A park district bought land in a neighboring county for a park. The township brought an action for declaratory relief against the park district and the Attorney General for a determination that the park district had no extraterritorial eminent domain power, that the statute that granted the park district exemption from real estate tax was unconstitutional, and that the park district was subject to local zoning laws. The trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action and the township sought review. The court held that: (1) &quot;acquiring&quot; property and &quot;annexing&quot; territory were completely separate functions; (2) under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1545.11, the &quot;acquiring&quot; government agency became the owner, a possessor of title in real property; (3) under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1545.15, the title to the property remained unchanged but the owner of the property became subject to the &quot;annexing&quot; agency's jurisdiction; (4) the park district had the power to buy land for a park outside of the district; (5) the township had to attack the tax exemption directly; and (6) the park district had to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the zoning restrictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment as to the issue of the application of the township zoning laws to the park district property, and otherwise affirmed the judgment that denied the township's challenge to the power of the park district to acquire land outside the district and to the constitutionality of the park district's exemption from real property tax.</SPAN></P>

Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to dismiss. The Vandalia Municipal Court, Vandalia, Ohio, Criminal Division denied defendant's motion, and convicted him. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant bought and sold gold and silver, coins, scrap gold and silver, diamonds, jewelry, and stamps. A deputy, who did not have a search warrant, went to defendant's home and requested to inspect his records with regard to the items which defendant purchased, sold, exchanged, or received. Defendant refused to comply with the deputy's request. As a result, he was found guilty of violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4737.01. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the statute was neither void for vagueness nor overbroad. The court rejected defendant's argument that he should not have been prosecuted under the statute because he could not reasonably have understood or anticipated that he was a purchaser and seller of gold and silver, coins, scrap gold and silver, diamonds, jewelry, and stamps and would fall within the parameters of the statute. The court found that the search permitted under the statute was carefully limited to inspection of a book listing transactions and was not a carte blanche authority to search the premises of the dealer. The statute unquestionably furthered legitimate state interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee city imposed a tax on amounts received from admission to any cinema in the city by Springfield, Ohio, Ordinances ch. 97 (1979). Appellant cinema company brought suit asking that the ordinance be declared unconstitutional and that enforcement be enjoined. The city counterclaimed, asking for a judgment declaring the ordinance valid. Both parties moved for summary judgment, and a trial court (Ohio) declared the ordinance valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The reasons for the tax given in ordinance were to offset the cost of additional municipal services and to provide additional revenue. The cinema company claimed that the ordinance violated its right to equal protection because it imposed a discriminatory tax on cinemas and not on any other place of business, amusement, or recreation. The cinema company made no claim of discriminatory application. The court ruled that summary judgment was appropriate because there could be no factual dispute material to the issue of facial validity. The court added that the cinema company presented no factual issues. The court found no denial of equal protection. The court pointed out that a taxing authority could discriminate between trades and activities as long as the classification rested on some ground of difference that had a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation. The court explained that both of the reasons given in the ordinance were substantially related to a governmental purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that at the outset of his retrial on the aggravated murder charge, he stood convicted of kidnapping. Defendant argued that the kidnapping was a lesser included offense of the aggravated murder charge and that, therefore, they were the same offense for double jeopardy purposes. Because the retrial was the second trial for the same offense, defendant contended that the aggravated murder retrial was prohibited by double jeopardy. Affirming the denial of defendant's motion to dismiss, the court held that defendant, by pursuing an appeal of the aggravated murder conviction, caused it to be set aside; thus, there was no constitutional bar to a retrial of defendant on the aggravated murder charge. The court held that the kidnapping conviction was not subsumed in the aggravated murder charge as a lesser included offense because kidnapping required restraint or removal, which aggravated murder did not. Thus, the offenses were not the same for double jeopardy purposes. The State, by moving for reconsideration in the initial decision, did not elect to forego reprosecution of defendant on the aggravated murder charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with intentionally uttering or knowingly possessing a false or forged prescription for a Schedule IV controlled substance. The prescription document was for 50 milligrams of pentaxocine (Talwin). After a non-jury trial, the Court of Common Pleas of Greene County (Ohio) found defendant guilty of possessing and uttering a false or forged prescription under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.23(B)(1). He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court should have granted his motion to acquit because Talwin was not listed in the Ohio statute. The court explained that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.43 incorporated the federal lists, which included the drug as a Schedule IV controlled substance. Defendant argued that the State did not prove its case as a matter of law because the State failed to prove that the prescription was false or forged and that defendant knew the prescription was false or forged. The court accepted the trial court's finding that circumstances showed that defendant did know that he uttered and had possessed a false or forged prescription. The court explained that at the trial the State introduced substantial evidence that the prescription was forged and impressive evidence that defendant knew that the prescription was false. The court could not intervene. The court rejected defendant's argument that the evidence was insufficient. The court explained that the record disclosed ample evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that defendant entered a pharmacy seeking to have a prescription filled and knowing the prescription was false or forged.</SPAN></P>

The reclamation board of review confirmed the denial of the release of the bond. The trial court reversed the board's decision because it was unlawful and unreasonable. The trial court ordered the chief to release the bond. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the chief was permitted to enforce the statutory standards of Ohio Rev.

The court found that the board's decision was neither unreasonable nor unlawful.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a jury trial, appellant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter. She had asserted self-defense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court gave the jury two separate instructions on self-defense.

The jury sent a written request for a definition. The trial court then proceeded to read to the jury a full and accurate instruction on self-defense. Defense counsel did not object to the trial court's initial instruction on self-defense but objected to the second instruction because it contained instructions not previously given. Defense counsel further stated to the trial court that the failure to include a complete charge on self-defense in the initial instructions was both plain error and prejudicial. The court explained that the jury's request indicated that the jurors did not understand the trial court's initial instruction. The court concluded that the claimed error was not prejudicial. The court noted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(A) provided that the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, was upon the accused with regard to affirmative defenses.

The trial court denied the motion, defendant testified in his own behalf, and the defense rested. Defendant appealed the trial court's denial of his motions, but did not appeal the judgment. The court had previously held that an identical ordinance was not facially void. Also, the language of the ordinance tracked the language of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11(A)(2).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Village of Mogadore, Ohio, Ordinance 101 (1979) barred the use of business operating losses from being used to offset income from wages and salaries and imposed a $ 15 fine for improper filings. On appeal, the court distinguished between an ex post facto law, which related to crime only, and a retrospective law, which could relate to civil as well as criminal matters. The Ohio Constitution barred retroactive laws. To the extent that the imposition of a $ 15 fee for failure or refusal to file timely returns was not a criminal violation, it was not ex post facto, but merely retroactive legislation. As retroactive legislation was constitutionally unlawful in Ohio, the trial court should have found that the provision for the imposition of a fee for acts committed before the adoption of the resolution, was unconstitutional. The unconstitutionality of the resolution as a result of the retroactivity question became moot when applied only prospectively. Thus, the ordinance was valid and enforceable to the extent that it created criminal acts and penalties that could be brought for a period after the ordinance was enacted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant neighbor sought review of a judgment of the Lucas County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which affirmed a decision by appellee zoning board. The zoning board had granted an exception or a variance to a landowner to build and operate a marina on his property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The zoning board granted the exception to the landowner after he was denied a certificate to operate a marina on his land by the building inspector. The exception was based on a provision in the township zoning ordinance. The neighbor, who objected to the operation of the marina, sought review of the trial court's decision. The court held that the legislation applicable to the zoning board was insufficient to create the authority to grant an exception or a variance for the operation of a marina on the landowner's property. The court determined that the exception provision in the ordinance was inartfully drawn and insufficient to create an exception for a marina as the term &quot;exceptions&quot; was used in zoning law. The court decided that the exception provision impermissibly sought to vary Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.14(B), which set forth four criteria that had to be met before a variance could be granted by a board of zoning appeals. Because the zoning board lacked the authority to grant the exception or the variance, the court found that the zoning board's findings had to be reversed and the building inspector's denial of a permit was to be enforced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The assignments of error on the appeal by the former trustees of the Cincinnati Southern Railway and on the cross appeal by the City of Cincinnati are denied.  Counsel was instructed to journalize decisions on preliminary motions made at the hearing at Dayton, Ohio.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason for the resolution of each assignment of error cannot be stated with desirable brevity.  Since the parties and their ancestors have lived with the history of this railroad and its earlier litigation we will attempt to summarize the background for this latest chapter.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These proceedings also experienced a lengthy history.  Filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, the case was transferred to Butler County where it was heard on summary judgment proceedings.  The appeal from that judgment to the First District Court of Appeals was assigned by the Supreme Court to the Judges of the Second District, after which Butler County, became a part of the newly created Twelfth District Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The oral arguments were heard at Dayton, this court acting upon its continuing assignment in this case on behalf of the Court of Appeals for the new district for Butler County.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the issues&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are proliferated and at times disguised it is appropriate to organize the assignments of error that must be considered.  The appellant trustees list four assignments for review.  The first and the third are similar and are consolidated.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arguments under each will be considered as a single assignment.  Appellant's fourth assignment relates to an award for attorney fees and it will be considered with the cross-appeal by the city of Cincinnati which objects to any award for fees for the attorneys for such trustees.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former trustees contended that their position was created by the legislature and it was necessary to protect the terms, corpus, and beneficiaries of the railroad trust. The city had created superceding legislation that assigned new trustees to the trust. The former trustees had been given life tenure by the prior legislation. The court held that the former trustees lacked standing because the court found that the trust was intact and that the trust had remained financially profitable to the beneficiaries. The city was not restricted in its method of relinquishing the tenure of statutory trustees because it could not nullify the legislation appointing the new trustees on the former trustee's vague argument that alleged the spirit of the legislation revoked a property interest. The former trustees lacked a vested right in their office because they held legal title only for trust purposes, and acquired no individual legal right. The court held that there was no error by the trial court in failing to grant additional time to join or substitute the real parties in interest because there was no suggestion in the record as to who it was the former trustees desired to have added.</SPAN></P>

The land had been used a junkyard prior to the time it was annexed by the city and prior to the enactment of the city's zoning regulations. The use of the property as a junkyard was a nonconforming use. When the licensing process was turned over to another city department, the license was withheld until the owners erected a seven foot tall fence around the junkyard, pursuant to Columbus, Ohio Code &sect; 3392.10. After a hearing, the board ordered the fence to be built. The owner appealed and the trial court affirmed the board's decision. The owner again appealed. On appeal, the court determined that because use of the land as a junkyard was a preexisting nonconforming use, the owner was not required to comply with the requirements of &sect; 3392.10.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction, claiming that the evidence presented was a deprivation of privacy, that the ordinance was unconstitutional, and that the decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court affirmed the conviction and held that (1) defendant did not have a right to privacy where he, by his own acts, stood unclothed before a window overlooking a public parking lot; (2) the ordinance was not vague because defendant knew that by his actions of standing naked in front of a large window his actions were likely to result in a risk of reckless misconduct; and (3) the evidence was sufficient where defendant admitted that he had exposed his private parts; thus it could have been found that his conduct constituted a reckless act within the meaning of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, who were a mother and her children, sought review of a decision by the Washington County Common Pleas Court, Juvenile Division (Ohio), which awarded permanent custody of the children to appellee Washington County, Ohio Children Services Board. The Board had filed a complaint alleging that the children were neglected, as defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.03, and requesting permanent custody of the children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Alleging neglect, the Board filed a petition to obtain custody of the children, and the juvenile court awarded permanent custody to the Board. The court affirmed the award and found that &sect; 2151.03 was constitutional on its face despite the fact that the statute used non-specific guidelines to govern the determination of whether a course of conduct was proscribed. Because &sect; 2151.03 was constitutional, the dispositional hearings that were held after a finding of neglect under &sect; 2151.03(B) did not violate due process. The Board's proceeding did not violate due process because its complaint alleged sufficient particular facts to satisfy the requirements of &sect; 2151.27 and gave the mother adequate notice of the facts to be presented against her at the neglect hearing. In addition, the court found that the finding of neglect was supported by the manifest weight of the evidence. The Board's case depended on proof that the children lacked proper parental care because of the faults or habits of their parents, and the Board presented ample evidence to show that the mother and father failed to provide proper parental care.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was shown officer identification, told that there was a warrant for his arrest, and that he was under arrest. Defendant fled the parking lot, and struck a police cruiser and another vehicle in the process. On appeal, defendant claimed that the escape statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.34, was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because the term &quot;detention&quot; was vague. The court found that, under &sect; 2921.34, once an arrest was effected, the individual was in a &quot;detained&quot; status, and if he broke that detention, he was guilty of escape. The court further found that the wording of &sect; 2921.34 was specific, precisely written, and understandable to a person of ordinary intelligence. Because &sect; 2921.34 was sufficiently clear and unambiguous in defining the prohibited activity, the court rejected defendant's claim, and affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his conviction by the Municipal Court of Franklin County (Ohio) for aggravated menacing in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 290.03. Defendant claimed that the evidence did not support the verdict, that the trial court erred in excluding evidence of instances in which he remained peaceable when he was provoked, and that the trial court erred in excluding evidence of a victim's civil suit that arose from the same incident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused of threatening the victims, a store employee and a customer, in the course of an altercation over some bushes that defendant's friend had purchased from the store. The victims and a third party testified that defendant had threatened the victims with a gun. Defendant and his friend testified that although defendant was angry and may have threatened to hit one of the victims, he never threatened the victims with his gun. The police retrieved a gun from defendant's car. The gun matched a description that was given by one of the victims. On appeal, the court held that the evidence supported defendant's conviction for aggravated menacing, noting that even if he did not use the gun, he could have been convicted for menacing because at least one victim had cause to believe that defendant was going to cause him serious physical harm. The court held that defendant was not entitled to the admission of evidence of specific instances of his conduct to prove that he was peaceable. The court held that evidence of the civil suit that one of the victims had filed against defendant was relevant on the issue of his credibility and should have been admitted by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's aggravated menacing conviction and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant corporation challenged the decision of the Common Pleas Court of Logan County (Ohio), which affirmed the decision of appellee Board of Zoning Appeals of Washington Township, Logan County, which denied an application made by the corporation for a variance in a setback requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation wished to construct a series of condominiums on its land. In order to proceed, the corporation needed a modification of a setback requirement imposed by the Zoning Ordinance. The board denied the corporation's request for a variance, but granted a conditional use permit. The corporation appealed the board's decision to the trial court pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.02. The trial court, in affirming the board's decision, held that the corporation had failed to establish any special condition or unnecessary hardship. On appeal, the corporation argued that the trial court erred in affirming the board's decision. The court held that in order to authorize a variance under &sect; 1019 of the Zoning Ordinance, the board must first affirmatively find that a literal enforcement of the zoning ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship. Next, the court held that the board properly denied the corporation's request because the board did not find the existence of an unnecessary hardship. Moreover, the court held that the board acted in compliance with both the Zoning Ordinance and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.14.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The hospital filed an application with the Ohio Department of Insurance to increase its rates for its non-group subscriber contracts. After a hearing, the Superintendent granted 70 percent of the hospital's requested rate increase based on a finding that the hospital was not in compliance with Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 3901-1-28(F)(6) and (F)(7), but that the rates were otherwise actuarially justified. The trial court affirmed the Superintendent's decision. On appeal, the hospital argued that the trial court erred in concluding that the Superintendent's order was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence as required by law. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the Superintendent's finding that the hospital did not make a good faith effort to reduce costs pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1739.051(D) and Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 3901-1-28(F)(6) and (F)(7) was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence that the hospital failed to promote and encourage cost savings through the use of financial incentives. The court further held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1739.051 and Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 3901-1-28(F) were not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a decision from the Cleveland Municipal Court (Ohio), which, at the close of the evidence, denied defendant's renewed motion for judgment of acquittal and found defendant guilty of two violations of the Cleveland, Ohio, Building and Zoning Code. The trial court also overruled defendant's motion to vacate the finding of guilt and for discharge on the grounds that the relevant ordinance was void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The alleged violations involved illegal use of premises as an auto repair garage, and failure to keep exterior property areas free of wrecked, inoperative, or unlicensed motor vehicles. Defendant argued that his conviction was contrary to law. The issue was whether a trustee lessor could be held criminally responsible for the actions of his tenant. More specifically, the issue was whether a refusal to avoid a lease and re-enter into possession was an indictable offense under the statute. The court held that defendant was under no legal obligation to induce his tenant to remove or to abstain from the illegal use of the premises. The court held that there was no evidence that defendant's dealings with the lessee was in any capacity other than that of a landlord, or that defendant had leased the premises with knowledge that the tenant would use the premises as a repair garage in violation of the zoning laws. Accordingly, the court found that defendant's conviction was contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
