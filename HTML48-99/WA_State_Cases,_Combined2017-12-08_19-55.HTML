<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Trial court's dismissal of Tuckers' tort claim reversed and trial court's denial of Tuckers' motion for mandamus affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners filed a tort action against the defendant county. The Superior Court of Pierce County (Washington) granted the county's motion for summary judgment. The property owners challenged the grant of summary judgment decision and the denial of their motion for mandamus. The county cross-appealed an order imposing the terms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners applied for a building permit to erect a sawmill storage building and a storage shed on the corner of its land. The county awarded the building permit. However, the property owners expanded his commercial sawmill operation beyond the scope of the building permit. The county charged the property owners with a criminal zoning code violation. After the county dropped the criminal charges, the property owners filed their tort action, alleging negligent issuance of the building permit, negligent and intentional non-enforcement of the zoning code, and negligent prosecution. However, the property owners did not file a notice of claim with the county before filing their lawsuit. The county denied the property owners' claim that the notice ordinance was unconstitutional, but did not plead as an affirmative defense any statute or local ordinance creating a notice of claim requirement. The court found no support for the conclusion that the property owners failed to file a claim with the county because the county failed to comply with the pleading requirements and that the county failed to argue its ordinance when it filed its motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's ruling on the mandamus and remanded the order for terms. However, the court reversed the trial court's decision granting summary judgment in favor of the county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court convicted appellant on various counts of first and second-degree theft and one count of forgery. The court affirmed because it found no merit in appellant's claims that her speedy trial rights were violated. The court found that appellant failed to follow the provisions of Wash Rev. Code &sect; 9.98.010(1) because she did not cause to be delivered to the prosecuting attorney and the superior court a proper written notice of her incarceration in another county. The court also found the preliminary proceedings and trial on another charge were excludable from time computations. The court also found that the evidence disclosed facts which, if believed by the jury, supported the elements of each charge claimed to be in error by appellant so the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict for each count. The court also found appellant was not being imprisoned for nonpayment of debt because her debt was accumulated by color of aid or deception. The court also found she could not claim the verdicts were inconsistent and that the exceptional sentence she received was not in error. The court also affirmed because there was no prosecutorial misconduct in the closing argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision by the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which sentenced defendant to life in prison under the Persistent Offender Accountability Act (Act), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.030(23), (27), as a result of repeated convictions for second-degree robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction and sentence alleging both trial error as well as constitutional and procedural defects with the Act. The court found that the trial court was correct in permitting the manager's identification of defendant and defendant's cross examination of the manager as to the detective's statements as well as the physical events surrounding the manager's identification of the person running through the parking lot. Defendant's argument that the sergeant illegally seized the identification card failed because the scope of defendant's voluntary consent was not exceeded and the sergeant had a reasonable suspicion to investigate the identification card. Even if the permanent retention of the card was found to be an unlawful seizure, there were no fruits of the poisonous tree to suppress. The trial court's denial of discovery was proper because defendant did not overcome the threshold necessary to obtain the desired discovery. The state gave early notice that if convicted; defendant could have been found a persistent offender. The Act, as applied to defendant, did not constitute ex post facto punishment. According, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which sentenced defendant to life in prison under the Persistent Offender Accountability Act.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 74.08.331, when defendants were charged with committing theft as defined by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.56.020. The court agreed and reversed defendant's theft by welfare fraud convictions. Defendants were charged in the indictment with committing the crime of theft, but that the jury was instructed on a different uncharged crime, welfare fraud.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which convicted him of unlawful possession of a weapon under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040(1)(a). Defendant alleged that the officer lacked probable cause to make an arrest and that the seriousness level of his crime was erroneously increased by an unconstitutionally-enacted initiative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer responded to a tip. When the suspect saw that the apartment manager had seen him carrying a shotgun, he hid the gun and ran away. The officer observed an individual running who matched the description. Another officer conducted a search and determined that defendant was a convicted felon. The first officer found the shotgun. The trial court convicted defendant under the unlawful possession statute. The court affirmed. The apartment manager had previously reported suspicious arrests. His previous reports were credible and he was not involved in criminal activity. The court held that the relaxed veracity standard that applied to identified citizen informants was satisfied. The tip provided the officer with probable cause to believe that two crimes had been committed. Defendant was around the area where the gun was stashed. The court held this provided a reasonable basis to detain defendant. Since defendant's actions suggested he might be violent, the officer's drawing of his gun was proper. The duration of the stop was reasonable. The court held that the defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied. The court held that defendant showed no constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Snohomish County (Washington), which convicted him of first degree burglary pursuant to Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction. On review, the court affirmed and held that Initiative 159, &sect; 9's armed with a deadly weapon provision did not violate the single subject rule of Wash. Const. art II, &sect; 19 of the Washington Constitution. Initiative 159, &sect; 9 expanded the first degree burglary statute to include armed burglaries of nonresidential buildings and this fell squarely within Initiative 159's legislative title's single subject of increasing penalties for armed crime. Therefore, defendant's first degree burglary conviction did not result from &quot;logrolling.&quot; Also, the jury's special verdict finding that defendant was not actually armed during the burglary was not irreconcilable with its general verdict finding him guilty of first degree burglary.The jury found that his accomplice was armed. To convict defendant of first degree burglary, the jury had to find that in so entering or while in the building or in immediate flight from the building defendant or an accomplice was armed with a deadly weapon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Department of Licensing, challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Grant County (Washington) that enjoined it from suspending the driver's license of respondent juvenile in the juvenile's action seeking a declaratory judgment and an order enjoining the Department from suspending his license. The Department suspended the juvenile's license pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.265 after he pled guilty to possession of marijuana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department contended that it was error to determine that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.265 applied only to persons younger than 18. The court reversed the judgment and dissolved the injunction, explaining that &sect; 46.20.265 unambiguously required the Department to revoke the driving privileges of &quot;a juvenile&quot; when it received notice from a court of certain criminal violations. The court acknowledged certain provisions of &sect; 46.20.265 were not consistent with each other because their applicability depended upon different definitions for &quot;a juvenile&quot; but opined that the legislative intent to apply the license-revocation scheme for drug violators up to age 21 rather than up to age 18 was clear. The court found no violation of the equal protection guaranties of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12, noting that the statutory classification was not wholly arbitrary because it was rationally related to the legitimate state objectives of promoting highway safety and deterring drug use.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Superior Court of Pierce County (Washington), which granted the State's petition to have him committed as a sexually violent predator under the Sexually Violent Predator Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09. Defendant argued that he did not have a speedy trial and that his commitment violated guarantees of equal protection and substantive due process and prohibitions against double jeopardy and ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had a long history of sexually violent felonies. The State sought to have him committed under the Act. Defendant was detained but was not brought to trial within the 45 days, as the Act formerly required. Defendant's attorney filed a motion to dismiss, which the trial court denied, concluding that defendant had waived his rights to a speedy trial. Defendant was ordered committed and on his appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant had been denied a speedy trial because it was the State's obligation to bring him before the trial court and defendant had not asked for a continuance or stated that he would waive his right to a speedy trial. However, the violation of the right to a speedy trial did not required vacation of defendant's commitment as a remedy because he provided no argument that the delay affected the outcome of his trial. Each of defendant's constitutional challenges to the Act, including substantive due process, equal protection, double jeopardy, and ex post facto violations, had been ruled meritless by the Washington Supreme Court in another case, as well as by the United States Supreme Court in a case challenging a similar Kansas statute.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that: (1) a defect in defendant's outdated plea form, which did not contain a provision required by Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 4.2(g), was remedied by the trial court's careful determination of the mandatory community placement term and discussion with defendant and counsel of the consequences; (2) the trial court and the State gave defendant extensive information on the two years of mandatory community placement and allowed him two recesses to discuss the consequence before the guilty plea was entered; and (3) defendant's appeal almost five years after sentencing was untimely pursuant to Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county adopted a countywide planning policy under the Growth Management Act. The county submitted the plan to the board. The board ordered the county to include certain acres of land in its urban growth area.

The environmental organization challenged the decision contending that the inclusion order was merely suggestive, rather than directive, and the environmental impact statement was inadequate. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's decision. The inclusion order expressly directed the county to include the areas in the urban growth area. The inclusion order was only subject to one interpretation and expressly required the county to include the acres. The court found that the environmental impact statement was adequate because it informed the county of the environmental consequences of the plan and allowed the county to make reasonable decisions regarding its implementation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a lengthy passport fraud investigation, federal agents found that defendant had rented an apartment under a false identity. Local police served an arrest warrant and saw numerous suspicious documents in plain view after a protective sweep of defendant's apartment. The federal agents used these observations to seek and obtain a search warrant for documents and driver's licenses under one of defendant's aliases. While executing the search warrant, the agents opened an ice chest and found cocaine. They also read the numerous documents in the apartment and seized evidence of a large mail order cocaine distribution scheme. The court held that: (1) the agents had legitimately performed the protective sweep and read the documents; (2) because the area inspected immediately adjoined the place of arrest, the agents need not have justified their actions by establishing a concern for safety as an incident to the arrest; (3) the plain view doctrine was an exception to the Fourth Amendment requirement that search warrants particularly describe the items to have been seized; and (4) the agents were entitled to have searched anything inside the apartment that could have contained the items.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold cocaine to an undercover police officer inside a tavern that was located within 1,000 feet of a school. Defendant argued that the sentencing enhancement statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.435(a), violated due process and equal protection when the drug sale occurred in a tavern because children could not be there. On appeal, the court rejected his arguments, holding that the &quot;school zone&quot; statute sufficiently defined the prohibited conduct to include drug deliveries that occurred in taverns. Due process did not require offenders to know they were dealing drugs inside a drug-free zone, and the school zone enhancement was a strict liability statute. Moreover, the legislative interest underlying the statute, to keep drug dealers away from schoolchildren, was a legitimate one. The court held that the objective was rationally related to punishing drug dealers more harshly when they did business in taverns in drug-free zones. In order to enter a tavern that was located within 1,000 feet of a school, a drug seller had to pass through areas in which school children were likely to be present. This increased the likelihood that children would be exposed to the drug culture.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff park owners' group appealed from the orders of the Superior Court of Thurston County (Washington), which denied its motion for summary judgment on the question of whether the Mobile Home Parks--Resident Ownership Act (the Act), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 59.23, allowed a taking of property without just compensation in violation of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 and the Fifth Amendment. The trial court dismissed the facial challenge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act allowed tenants of mobile home parks to form associations and to receive a statutory right of first refusal in the event that a mobile home park owner wished to sell his mobile home park. On appeal, the court first considered whether Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 provided greater protection than the Fifth Amendment and looked at six nonexclusive factors: (1) the textual language of the state constitutional provision; (2) differences in the parallel texts of the federal and state constitutions;(3) state constitutional and common law history; (4) preexisting state law; (5) structural differences between the federal and state constitutions; and (6) whether the clause dealt with matters of particular state or local concern. The court held that the state and federal provisions were coextensive. The court examined the Act and found that no real property estate or interest was taken because a right of first refusal was a personal contract right under state law. The court found that the Act was a de minimis intrusion on the owners' rights, advanced a legitimate state interest in preserving housing, and did not deny the owners all economically viable use of their lands.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state initiated the underlying action to determine the parentage, visitation, and child support of the son of the father and mother. At trial, the father testified that he regularly used marijuana as a part of his Rastafarian religious practices. The trial court granted visitation to the mother and conditioned the father's visitation upon his ceasing his use of marijuana. On the father's appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order and held that it did not violate the father's First Amendment Right to free exercise of his religion because neutral, generally applicable laws could be applied to religious practices even when they were not supported by a compelling governmental interest. The trial court's order conditioning the father's visitation rights on ceasing illegal activity was not unreasonable or untenable. The court summarily dismissed the father's other challenges to the trial court's order for his failure to support the challenges with a cogent argument. The court declined to award costs to the state because the father's appeal was not frivolous.</SPAN></P>

The officer saw defendant, who matched the description of the suspect, and was carrying a revolver. The officer stepped out of his patrol car and shined a spotlight directly on defendant. Defendant got rid of the gun and ran from the police. The police found defendant and the gun. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence of the gun. On appeal, the court upheld the denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence of the gun and affirmed his conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm. The court held that defendant failed to preserve his argument that the act of shining the spotlight on him was an unconstitutional seizure in the trial court. Regardless, the court held that defendant failed to prove that a seizure occurred because by running from the officer, defendant did not submit to the show of authority as required to establish a seizure. The court held that the penalty enhancement provisions, which increased the seriousness level of defendant's crime and resulted in a longer sentence, was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, citizens and Board of Denture Technology (board), sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of Thurston County (Washington), which awarded judgment in favor of respondents, Secretary and Washington State Department of Health, and dismissed appellants' challenges to Substitute Senate Bills 5308, Laws of 1995, ch. 198 (SSB 5308), and 5365, Laws of 1995, ch. 336 (SSB 5365) as violative of Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants asserted that SSB 5308 and SSB 5365 violated the single subject and title specificity provisions of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19. They noted that when the voters passed Initiative 607, which allowed persons other than dentists to make and sell dentures, they created the board to regulate that activity. Appellants argued that SSB 5308 and SSB 5365 improperly included provisions transferring regulatory authority over denturists to the secretary without giving adequate notice to the public in the bills' titles. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that &sect;&sect; 18-25 of SSB 5308 were unconstitutional since the bill's title was restrictive and mentioned only the use of examinations in credentialing health professionals. The court stated that since &sect;&sect; 18-25 dealt with other subjects outside of the scope of the title but could be severed from the rest of the bill, it would only strike down &sect;&sect; 18-25. The court found that the title of SSB 5365 was general in that it related to &quot;the uniform disciplinary act&quot; and that all its sections fit within the scope of the title. Thus, the court held that SSB 5365 did not violate Wash. Const. art II, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>

The environmental group sued to have the sale declared invalid and the trial court granted summary judgment to respondents. The court affirmed. The court held that the environmental group did not have standing to challenge the sale because its members were not taxpayers or residents of the city and they could not show any specific harm caused by the sale. The court considered the merits of the environmental group's claims to determine whether the appeal was frivolous. Because the city determined that the land was surplus to the city's needs and that the negotiated sale created benefits to the city outweighing an open bid process, there were no violations of law. The sale was not a loan of public money. The negotiated sale was not ultra vires because the city did not promise to rezone the land.

Defendant's proffered stipulation would have proved that he was a felon, and the unfair prejudice was significant. Defendant's statement on the omnibus order was not admissible to impeach his witnesses.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for robbery in the Superior Court of King County (Washington). Defendant argued that the trial court erred by not dismissing his case for violation of his speedy trial rights and prosecutorial mismanagement, that there were errors in the admission of exhibits and in his sentencing, and that the prosecutor committed misconduct in closing argument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two friends robbed a victim by enticing the victim to a hotel room, after which defendant and one of the friends beat the victim until he was unconscious. The victim positively identified defendant and his friends, and all three were tried together. Defendant was convicted of robbery, and the jury found him to be a persistent offender. The trial court sentenced defendant to life without the possibility of parole. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that defendant was not prejudiced by any errors at trial. The trial court was within its discretion to grant the continuance that did not violate defendant's speedy trial rights. Although the prosecutor should have produced the 911 tape of the victim, this failure did not prejudice defendant. Photographs of the victim's wounds, although gruesome, were properly admitted, as were photocopies of the stolen money. Any reference to defendant's decision to remain silent at trial was tangential at most, so the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion for mistrial. Defendant's sentence was not disproportionate or cruel under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 and did not violate the Sentencing Reform Act.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence was sufficient to prove that it was defendant's consumption of alcohol, either before or while driving the car, that directly resulted in his blood test reading.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which directed a verdict in favor of respondent State of Washington Department of Social and Health Services, Child Protective Services (CPS) on the grounds that a CPS social worker had absolute immunity from liability for negligence in conducting an investigation into allegations made by the father's children that he had sexually abused them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children's parents were divorced and custody granted to the mother. Thereafter the mother reported to CPS that the children claimed their father had sexually abused them. CPS's case worker initiated an investigation that was never resolved, although eventually it appeared that respondents, mother and her new husband, had influenced the children to make the allegations and that the new husband may have been the one abusing the children. In the father's tort action, the trial court directed a verdict for CPS on the grounds of absolute immunity. On appeal the court reversed, finding that absolute immunity was available only to functions that were intimately associated with the judicial phase of a proceeding, and finding further that the case worker's function was primarily investigatory. The court held that the state was not immune to a claim alleging negligence in an investigation. The court affirmed the dismissal of the cause of action for negligent supervision, finding that such claim was redundant inasmuch as the state had acknowledged that the case worker was acting within the scope of her employment and that the state would be vicariously liable for her conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the directed verdict in favor of CPS, finding that its case worker did not have absolute immunity because her function was primarily investigatory rather than intimately associated with a judicial proceeding. The court held that the state was not immune to the father's claim alleging negligent investigation into allegations that the father sexually abused his children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Cowlitz County (Washington) reversed, on the ground that Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 173-405-040(10) was unconstitutionally vague, a board ruling that had upheld appellant state agency's imposition of a fine on respondent corporation for failing to maintain pollution control equipment at a pulp mill. The state agency appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state agency's inspection had discovered large holes in the mill's scrubber system that emitted steam and spray into the air and created large quantities of mud. The corporation claimed that the requirement that it operate and maintain its scrubber system consistently with &quot;good air pollution control practices&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. The state agency contended that &sect; 173-405-040(10) was necessarily general because it had to apply to a variety of facilities, each with its own unique processes and equipment. The court determined that &sect; 173-405-040(10) was not unconstitutionally vague. The court stated that the corporation had fair notice that its failure to follow operation and maintenance procedures, in conjunction with its continued operation of damaged air pollution control equipment, could subject it to civil sanctions. The court noted that compliance with emissions limits was relevant but not dispositive. The court concluded that the trial court erred in finding &sect; 173-405-040(10)&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague, and further concluded that the board did not err in fining the corporation for violating the regulation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Superior Court of Pierce County (Washington), which was entered on a verdict convicting him of first degree armed robbery, attempting to elude a pursuing police vehicle, three counts of first degree assault with a deadly weapon, and taking a motor vehicle without permission and which sentenced him to a life sentence under the three strikes law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for his involvement in a bank robbery. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding no error in the prosecutor's comments on defendant's failure to testify because they were in response to defense counsel's assertion that defendant told the truth during a polygraph test. The court ruled that defendant was properly sentenced as a persistent offender because his discharged conviction could be used for sentencing in later offenses, and his convictions were proven by a preponderance of the evidence. The court found no prosecutorial misconduct in an alleged accomplice declining to testify and invoking his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent after the State informed him that federal authorities were also considering filing charges. The court ruled that the information was properly amended because defendant failed to show that the amendment added new facts to the case of which defendant had no notice such as prejudiced his substantial rights. The court concluded that the three strikes law was constitutional and was not ex post facto because it enhanced the penalty for the last crime committed and did not impose additional punishment for a prior conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.5055 provided that a person who was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and who had a prior offense, which included deferred prosecutions, within the last five years had to be given a higher minimum punishment than a person who had no prior offenses. The driver was arrested for DUI on September 13, 1995 and he had been granted a deferred prosecution for a similar charge in April 1992. The individual contended that &sect; 46.61.5055 was unconstitutional. The court stated that the driver's contention that his deferred prosecution agreement did not give him fair notice that an enhanced sentence was a consequence of his agreement was without merit because the deferred prosecution statute did not require written notice of all consequences of the agreement. The court held that the state had a legitimate, substantial interest in preventing people from threatening life and property by habitually drinking and driving and the statute was a valid exercise of police power and it was reasonably related to accomplishing its purpose. The court upheld the constitutionality of the statute and the driver's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Douglas County (Washington), convicting him of escape from community custody, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.09.310, and sentencing him to 90 days based on an offender score of one point imposed under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.360(18) (now Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a felony drug offense, obtained early release to community custody, and subsequently violated the conditions of community placement. Defendant argued that the community custody escape statute was unconstitutionally vague, his incriminating statements in the administrative hearing, which revoked his community placement, were inadmissible at the criminal trial, and the revocation of early release was punishment that precluded his escape prosecution on double jeopardy grounds. The appellate court ruled that defendant's vagueness claim was without merit and his statements from the administrative proceeding were admissible. Arguably the testimony of defendant's caseworker regarding his incriminating statements were more prejudicial than probative, however, the trial court had wide discretion in making such determinations, and an erroneous evidence ruling did not require reversal, unless it was of constitutional magnitude and materially affected the outcome. Furthermore, the criminal prosecution did not constitute double jeopardy, as returning defendant to jail for violating the terms of his conditional release was punishment for the original crime.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the possession with intent and conspiracy convictions were supported by sufficient evidence. The court reversed defendants' convictions for operating a drug house due to insufficient evidence, and the court held that the sentencing court erred by counting the charged crimes separately when it computed defendants' offender scores because they involved the same criminal conduct and remanded back to the sentencing court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The court ordered defendant to pay restitution and subsequently extended the time period it retained jurisdiction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court, pursuant to an amendment to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.190, extended the date to collect restitution for 10 years beyond the date of the disposition. Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by extending jurisdiction to collect restitution beyond the date he turned 21, as that imposed an ex post facto punishment. The court of appeals disagreed. The purpose of juvenile restitution was to compensate the victim and impose accountability on the juvenile. Restitution primarily served the goal of rehabilitation. Because restitution was not punitive, the ex post facto doctrine was not implicated. The fact that a sanction, including imprisonment, might later have been imposed for willfully violating a restitution order did not change the remedial nature of the restitution. Therefore, the trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court erred by dismissing its petition, because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.05 did not require supporting affidavits for 180-day petitions. The court of appeals disagreed. While the statute did not set out the procedural requirements for a 180-day petition, it did state that the hearing was the same as that for a 90-day petition. The legislature assured patients' due process rights for each duration of commitment. As the length of detention increased, the statute provided additional procedural rights. Therefore, it was unlikely that the legislature intended to exclude the notice provision for patients who faced the longest period of commitment. The legislature intended all of the procedural requirements for the 90-day petition to apply in a 180-day petition. There was no support in law or logic for lessening the rights of a patient who faced a longer commitment. Therefore, the trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teachers argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by upholding the Department's finding that earnable compensation did not include retirement incentive payments. The court of appeals disagreed. Substantial evidence supported the Department's finding. The director testified that, upon learning that excess payments for retirement incentives were included by the colleges in earnable compensation, the Department did not categorize such pay as compensation for rendering services. That interpretation and practice, he further testified, was also based upon advice from the Washington Attorney General's Office that those types of retirement incentive payments could not be included for purposes of calculating pension benefits. The department's finding was also supported by the testimony of an auditor, who stated that she understood that the department consistently excluded payment above and beyond normal rates from earnable compensation. Accordingly, the trial court did not commit error by affirming the department's finding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 17-year-old with no criminal history when the offense was committed, was convicted of first degree murder by the Superior Court, Pend Oreille County (Washington). He appealed, contending the court erred by denying his request for a declination hearing in juvenile court and that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.04.030 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a friend, burglarizing a residence, heard a vehicle pull into the driveway, and exited. The homeowner confronted them and they both shot at him. Defendant's shot missed, but the other's shot hit and killed the homeowner. They were arrested and defendant was charged as an adult with first degree murder. The trial court denied his motion for a declination hearing, and rejected the argument that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.04.030 as amended was unconstitutional. It denied his motion to dismiss for violation of his right to a speedy trial and he was found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to 280 months' imprisonment. On appeal, he contended the trial court erred by denying his motion for a decline hearing and maintained Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.110 mandated a declination hearing for juvenile defendants, unless waived. He pointed to a conflict with the automatic decline provisions of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.030. The conflict between Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.110 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.030 was resolved by applying rules of statutory construction supporting the validity of the automatic decline provisions of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.04.030(1)(e)(iv).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant adult entertainment establishments sought review of an order of the Superior Court of Spokane County (Washington), which upheld the constitutionality of Spokane, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 10.08 in a suit against appellees, city and hearing officer. The ordinance prohibited licensing of adult arcades owned by those previously convicted of certain crimes and regulated peep show operations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adult entertainment establishments were denied licenses to operate adult arcades because they failed to comply with open booth and other requirements contained in &sect; 10.08 and one of them had been convicted of interstate transport of obscenity, which disqualified it from licensing under Spokane, Wash. Mun. Code &sect; 10.08.118(8)(b). On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part, finding first that the restrictive provisions of the ordinance were constitutional. The court reasoned that the ordinance was content neutral, aimed at protecting the public health, safety, and welfare, was narrowly tailored to promote a substantial governmental interest, did not affect the content of the peep shows, or restrict the number of booths in an establishment. Thus, the court held that the restrictions passed muster under the First Amendment and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 5. However, the court determined that the provision disqualifying applicants from licensing based on previous criminal convictions was an unconstitutional prior restraint since an applicant's past convictions did not necessarily reflect on his qualifications to operate an adult entertainment business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the trial court's order that held that the ordinance provisions regulating the adult entertainment establishments' peep show operations were constitutional. The court reversed that part of the order which held constitutional the ordinance provision disqualifying those with convictions for certain criminal convictions from obtaining licenses to operate adult arcades within the city.</SPAN></P>

The developers contended that the town's conditions violated their rights to due process because the town had not adopted its own subdivision ordinance with objective standards governing subdivision plat requirements. They contended further that their application met the state standards listed in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 58.17.020(4) and .110. The court affirmed that part of the trial court's judgment dealing with the developers' constitutional rights in that they had not established that the town's lack of a subdivision ordinance violated those rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city decided to form a downtown parking and business improvement area (PBIA), and after the adoption of the implementing ordinance, the property owner filed a suit challenging the enabling act, the validity of the PBIA, and the imposition of assessments against commercial real property owners as well as businesses. The court held that the trial court's finding that there was more than 60 percent support for the PBIA proposal was supported by substantial evidence, and the city complied with all statutory requirements. The charges imposed did not constitute an invalid tax, and the property owner's First Amendment claims were not yet ripe for resolution. Given the property owner's failure to establish even the first prerequisite for a class action, the trial court's refusal to certify the case was neither unreasonable nor untenable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Thurston County (Washington), convicting him of one count of unlawful possession of a firearm in the first degree, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040(1)(a), and four counts of possession of a stolen firearm, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.56.310.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040(1)(a) was unconstitutionally vague and that the evidence underlying the unlawful possession of a firearm was insufficient to support his conviction on that count. The appellate court ruled that the statute was not void for vagueness and that the evidence was sufficient to support the count. Based on the evidence, a rational trier could have found that defendant possessed and controlled the backpack, including the gun found therein, and that he had previously been convicted of second degree burglary. Also, defendant failed to establish he received ineffective assistance of counsel, as some of defendant's witnesses were accomplices, and defense counsel may have reasonably believed that the jury instruction, which would have told the jury to view the testimony of accomplices with caution, would disadvantage the defense. Furthermore, the bailiff did not think that the jury actually observed defendant handcuffed, and the trial court so found. Even if a juror caught a glimpse, there was nothing to suggest that the sight inflamed or prejudiced the jury to such an extent that a fair trial was not possible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 36.26.040. The water and sewer services customer challenged the superior court's grant of summary judgment in favor of respondents, city and county. The court held that the charges were fees, not taxes, based on the regulatory purposes for the program, the allocation of amounts generated for those regulatory purposes, and the direct relationship between the fees and the services received by the payors and the burden on the payors. The sewer construction contemplated under the program served the regulatory purpose of preventing pollution and continued degradation of the aquifer. The court then rejected the water and sewer services customer's claims based on the assumption that the charges were taxes, and held that the fees did not violate the Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause. Further, the fees for the aquifer protection area did not constitute unlawful special assessments or the deprivation of property under the Takings Clause. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court for Snohomish County, Washington, that convicted him of one count of first-degree statutory rape and one count of indecent liberties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's statutory rape conviction arose from allegations of multiple acts. He generally denied all but one of the acts. The indecent liberties conviction arose from the one act that defendant specifically denied. On appeal, the court reversed the statutory rape conviction and remanded for a new trial. The court held that the trial court committed a manifest constitutional error affecting defendant's right to a unanimous jury error by not electing one of the multiple acts to support the single statutory rape count and by not giving a Petrich instruction. The error was not harmless because there was evidence as to the one act that could have justified a reasonable doubt in a juror's mind. Regarding the indecent liberties' conviction, the court held that none of the alleged instances of prosecutorial misconduct, individually or cumulatively, warranted a reversal. The trial court's admitting into evidence one of two relevant photos was not unduly prejudicial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in issuing a warrant to search defendant's property bin at a jail for items containing his alias name because the alias information was contained on a booking sheet property form.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of the trial court's judgment that convicted and sentenced defendant of first-degree statutory rape.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1990, defendant, then a juvenile, was adjudicated guilty of burglary in the second degree. At the time, the unlawful possession of a firearm statute made no reference to juvenile offenders.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040(1) (1989) (amended 1992). In 1992, this statute was amended to include juvenile adjudications as predicate offenses. In 1994, the legislature amended the statute again and enacted Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.047, which required notification at the time of conviction of ineligibility to possess a firearm.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.047(1)(a). In 1996, defendant was charged with one count of unlawful possession of a firearm in the first degree, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040(1)(a) (amended 1996). Defendant was convicted of the charge and sentenced to 21 months. Defendant appealed the judgment and argued that plaintiff state was required to prove his guilty knowledge. The court affirmed the judgment and held that defendant's conviction was proper because knowledge of the illegality of possession of a firearm was not an element to the crime of unlawful possession of a firearm, according to legal precedent and legislative history.</SPAN></P>

Rather, it allowed police to search for &quot;any and all controlled substances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the trial court's order granting defendant's motion to suppress marijuana that police had obtained pursuant to a search warrant. The trial court declared the search warrant was insufficiently particular because it did not identify marijuana as the item to be seized but instead allowed police to search for &quot;any and all controlled substances.&quot; Upon appeal, the court reversed, holding that all that was required was reasonable particularity under these circumstances. The court stated that the officers were authorized to inspect virtually every aspect of the premises, and if during their search they discovered another illegal substance, the nonspecified substance would be subject to seizure under the plain view doctrine. The court stated that the officers executing the warrant at hand had no broader discretion to search than they would have had if the warrant had specified &quot;marijuana.&quot; The court held that the fact the warrant could have been more precise in terms of identifying marijuana as the focus of the search did not affect its validity, since reasonable particularity was all that was required.</SPAN></P>

A doctor testified that the children's development and integration would be severely hampered if they were allowed to stay with their mother, and that continued contact with the mother would have exacerbated the children's feelings of trauma due to the long term, repeated abuse they had suffered. A social worker testified that the mother was not responding to services and had shown an inability to change. She testified that termination was in the best interests of the children.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant A was arrested for driving under the influence as he parked his car. Defendant A claimed that he was not feeling the effects of the alcohol he had consumed when he drove the car, but that he was feeling the effects when he took a breathalyzer test an hour later. Defendant B was arrested for driving under the influence after being stopped for speeding. Both defendants challenged their convictions based on &sect; 46.61.502. The court affirmed defendant A's conviction but reversed and remanded as to defendant B's conviction. The court held that while the statute as a whole was constitutional, the affirmative defense set forth in &sect; 46.61.501(3) required defendants to disprove a necessary element of the crime in violation of due process protections. As the jury was not given the &sect; 46.61.501(3) instruction in defendant A's case and the state met is burden, his conviction should stand. However, in defendant B's case, the process was defective because the jury was given the incorrect instruction relating to the affirmative defense, and thus a new trial was warranted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by admitting his confession because it was not voluntary. The court of appeals disagreed. The critical question was whether a promise was made. Defendant's credibility was central to that issue and was resolved against him, as was a detective's credibility. The court of appeals deferred to those determinations, noting that they were circumstantially supported by the fact that defendant had the opportunity to record the alleged promise but did not do so, and by defendant's statement that he knew that he had just admitted to the crime. There was thus substantial evidence supporting the finding that no promise was made by police. The lack of a promise was fatal to defendant's claim that his confession was involuntary. Therefore, the trial court did not err by admitting the confession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant activists challenged an order of the Superior Court of Pierce County (Washington), which held in the activists' action for an injunction against respondent fair operator that the fair operator could restrict the activists' activity to a &quot;free speech area&quot; and that they were entitled to be present throughout the entire duration of the fair.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined, in the activists' action against the fair operator for injunctive relief, that the fair operator could restrict the activists' efforts to collect signatures to the fair's &quot;free speech area&quot; and that the activists could collect signatures each day that the fair was open. The court affirmed that judgment on appeal. The court held that because the fair took place on the fair operator's private property, the activists had no right to violate or to unreasonably restrict the fair operator's right to provide a safe and uncongested atmosphere where fairgoers could freely walk the fairgrounds and independently choose to visit a specific booth, exhibit, or display. The court also concluded that the activists did not show that restricting their solicitation to the &quot;free speech area&quot; caused the substantial injury that was required for issuing an injunction against that restriction. The court further opined that the fair was not a public forum because the fair operators did not have any direct ties to any governmental organization.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed their convictions. The court reversed defendants' conviction and affirmed one defendant's conviction to the extent that his complaint was constitutional. The court found that a logically and legally required, albeit implied, element of the offense described in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.502 was that an amount of alcohol sufficient to cause a measurement of breath or blood of one defendant to register 0.10 percent or greater within two hours of driving was present in the defendant's system while he was driving. The court found that the implied element mitigated the appellate court's concern that the statute criminalized behavior not generally deemed criminal. Because the appellate court's construction of the DWI statute operated as if it were originally written into it, the &quot;implied element&quot; was deemed to have been a required element for both convictions. The court held that failure to instruct on an element of an offense was automatic reversible error. The court also found that the complaints gave defendants notice of the elements of the charge against them and it was constitutionally sufficient.</SPAN></P>

The factory filed an action against the city and the PCA for intentional and negligent interference with business expectations and business relations.

On review, the factory claimed that its rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 were violated. The court rejected this argument finding that the factory had failed to properly preserve the issue for review by raising it at trial. The factory also argued that the PCA's regulations were void for vagueness. The court also rejected this argument because the factory failed to cite the specific regulations to which it was referring. The court also rejected the factory's claim that there was a civil conspiracy because the factory failed point out the facts that would establish that claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Detainee was convicted of second-degree rape and sentenced to prison. Shortly before he was scheduled to be released, the State filed a petition for commitment and a motion for determination of probable cause to find detainee a sexually violent predator. Detainee moved to dismiss the petition, contending that the Community Protection Act (&quot;Act&quot;) was unconstitutional. The court denied his motion. The jury found detainee was a sexually violent predator and the court ordered him committed. Detainee contended that the Act violated his right to due process by denying an adversarial hearing on the probable cause determination, and by failing to require treatment in the least restrictive environment. On appeal, the court held that due process required that detainee be allowed to appear in person to contest probable cause. However, detainee failed to show any prejudice resulting from denial of an adversarial hearing. The commitment proceeding, which was civil in nature, as with commitment of the criminally insane, was dealing with a most imprecise area of human behavior and attempting to predict future conduct for a particular individual. The trial court committed no error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged an order from the Superior Court of Benton County, Washington, which dismissed the Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 27.53.060(1) charges against defendants because the statute was unconstitutional. The statute prohibited removing archeological objects from any archeological resource or site.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were engaged in digging for and gathering arrowheads, items specifically mentioned in the definition of archeological resources per Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 27.53.040. Defendants argued that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 27.53.060(1) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The trial court agreed, found the statute unconstitutional, and dismissed the criminal charges of removing archeological objects from any archeological resource or site. The court reversed and remanded, holding that &sect; 27.53.060(1) was not unconstitutional. The court reasoned that while the term &quot;of archeological interest&quot; in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 27.53.060(1) might involve a subjective judgment, the judgment would be that of an archeologist, not a law enforcement officer.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 27.53.040, which defined &quot;archeological resource,&quot; adequately notified defendants of what objects and sites were prohibited from excavation. The court concluded that in determining whether a statute defined the prohibited conduct with sufficient specificity, the court considered whether the terms used were so vague that persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's request to impeach the victim with a telephone tape recording made in violation of the Washington Privacy Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 9.73. On appeal, defendant alleged that the trial court's suppression of the recorded telephone conversation violated his constitutional rights to confront witnesses and put on a defense. Upon review, the court found that the trial court properly suppressed the recording because defendant failed to make a sufficient offer of proof. Without a record of the tape's contents, the court was unable to review the trial court's ruling for error. While provisions of the Washington Privacy Act could have been overcome given sufficient constitutional justification, the instant matter was not such a case. The excluded tape was not the sole evidence impeaching the victim, and there was additional evidence implicating defendant as the stabber. Defendant's interest in impeaching the victim with cumulative evidence did not outweigh the State's compelling interest in protecting personal privacy by suppressing surreptitious recordings.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that there was no support for defendant's claim her representation was deficient, as the record showed her counsel negotiated a generous plea offer, which counsel effectively communicated with an unequivocal recommendation she accept the offer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of theft and sentenced him on May 5, 1995. The State sought restitution. On July 23, 1995, Wash. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 9.94A.142 was amended to change the restitution hearing time period from 60 days to 180 days after sentencing. Defendant sought a restitution hearing, but the State did not seek a hearing until November 1, 1995. Defendant asked for a continuance, which the trial court granted until November 9, 1995. The trial court stayed the restitution hearing until the court could determine defendant's restitution appeal. The court remanded the case to the trial court for further restitution proceedings, holding that because defendant committed an offense after July 1, 1985, Wash. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 9.94A.142 applied to his case. The amendment provided that the 180-day limit had retroactive effect if three conditions were met: (1) The court failed to set restitution within 60 days of sentencing as previously required; (2) the defendant was sentenced after July 23, 1994; and (3) the defendant was not unfairly prejudiced by the delay. The court concluded that the trial court complied with amended &sect; 9.94A.142.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four males broke into a couple's home. The couple was sleeping. They were held at gunpoint and restrained. Defendants took many items of property. The Hard Time for Armed Crime Act (the Act), 1995 Wash. Laws 129, did not violate Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19. The imposition of firearm enhancements, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.310(3), on defendants' first-degree robbery and burglary convictions did not violate double jeopardy principles. Defendants' convictions for first-degree robbery did not merge with first degree kidnapping. The trial court did not err in refusing to give defendants' kidnapping instruction, which would have required the State to prove the victims were moved. The statute did not require movement of the victims. The trial court's instructions properly stated the law. The trial court did not err by failing to suppress testimony about the victims' identification of the defendants in a showup; it was not overly coercive and met the threshold test for reliability and was admissible. The trial court did not err by rejecting defendants' motion to sever or by ordering the firearm enhancements to run consecutively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Responding to reports of gun shots, police officers found defendant, a 19-year old, walking down the street with a friend. Defendant was holding a box of ammunition, and his friend had a .44-caliber handgun. Defendant admitted that he had fired about four shots. Plaintiff state charged him with unlawfully possessing a firearm while having previously been convicted of a serious offense. At the age of 16, defendant had been adjudicated guilty in juvenile court of second degree robbery and second degree assault. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge for failure to state a claim, arguing that he was not &quot;convicted&quot; of a &quot;serious offense&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 9.41.010(1)(1) (1994), because his offenses were adjudicated in juvenile court. The trial court denied his motion and found him guilty of the offense. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that although the statute deleted the reference to juvenile adjudications, if such adjudications did not constitute predicate offenses, the statute would be superfluous because juveniles could never violate it even though it contained language that either an adult or juvenile could be guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant suffered previous convictions for several violent rapes against adolescent girls and young women. Before he was released from prison, the State moved to have him committed under the Washington's Sexually Violent Predator Statute (SVPS). At the SVPS trial, the State called defendant's victims, several experts, and defendant. Defendant stated that he wanted to testify; however, the trial court, after consulting with defense counsel, refused to let defendant testify on his own behalf although he had testified when the State called him. The trial court committed. On appeal, the court held that when defendant insisted that he wanted to testify, the trial court erred when it deprived him of that opportunity. The court reasoned that it had held that the right to testify was absolute and could not be abrogated by defense counsel. Although a SVPS commitment proceeding was civil in nature, Wash. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 71.09.060(2) expressly provided that all constitutional rights available to defendants at criminal trials, other than the right not to be tried while incompetent, applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the trial court erred by denying his motion for a directed verdict in which he claimed that the City failed to establish that the act was intentional and that it occurred in a public place. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly denied the motion. The court found that &sect; 10.06.020(A) defined urination in a place other than a toilet or public restroom as a lewd act. The court found that it was irrelevant that the act was not witnessed by anyone. Moreover, the court found that the City proved that defendant's act was intentional. Defendant also argued that &sect; 10.06.020 was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to define &quot;public place.&quot; The court held that &sect; 10.06.020 could be reasonably understood to forbid urinating in an entryway on a public street. Defendant also argued that &sect; 10.06.020 was unconstitutional because it embraced five types of conduct that were considered lewd acts. The court held that &sect; 10.06.020 was constitutional because there was a rational unity between the subject matter and the title. The proscribed acts were rationally related because they all involved lewd conduct, even though four of them were sexual in nature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of a serial murder investigation, a search warrant was issued for the homeowners' home.

The trial court granted the county's motion to dismiss all claims except the &sect; 1983 claim pursuant to Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 12(b)(6), from which the homeowners took no appeal. The trial court later granted the county's motion for summary judgment on the homeowners' &sect; 1983 claim. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order granting summary judgment to the county. The court ruled that municipalities could not be held liable for constitutional torts under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 on the basis of respondeat superior. However, municipalities could be held liable under &sect; 1983 for the single act of a municipal policymaker. The court ruled that the police officer who obtained the search warrant was not a policymaker for purposes of &sect; 1983 because he merely implemented municipal policy by seeking the warrant based on probable cause. Thus, there were no genuine issues of material fact, and the county was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

The city filed a forfeiture action in the municipal court. The individual brought a motion to remove the matter to the trial court.

The individual, without giving notice to the city, obtained a default judgment in the removal action. Ultimately, the trial court granted the city's motion to vacate the default judgment and its motion for summary judgment. The trial court also denied the individual's claim that the seizure violated her constitutional rights. The individual sought review. The court determined that: (1) the trial court did not err when it vacated the default judgment because the city was entitled to notice of the hearing where it did constructively appear when it filed the forfeiture action in the trial court; (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in continuing the forfeiture hearing until the motion to vacate the default judgment was held; and (3) the constitutionality of the seizure had already been determined in the individual's criminal trial.</SPAN></P>

The court found that: (1) the statute was a complete act rather than revisory and did not violate separation of powers because fixing penalties was always a legislative rather than judicial function; (2) the statute was not an unconstitutional bill of attainder and provided sufficient due process safeguards; (3) the statute did not permit cruel and unusual punishment through disproportionate sentencing; and (4) the statute was not in any way a violation of equal protection rights where persistent offenders were not part of a suspect class.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation sought review of a decision from the Superior Court for King County, Washington, which granted summary judgment dismissing its constitutional challenges to the 600-foot setback provided in Bellevue, Wash., Land Use Code &sect; 20.20.127 and to respondent City of Bellevue's adult entertainment licensing ordinance. The corporation also appealed contempt citations issued against it for failure to comply with an injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation had opened an establishment offering entertainment by male dancers wearing swimwear and lingerie. Before opening, the corporation obtained a cabaret license, but not an adult cabaret license, and failed to comply with the setback. It was the failure to comply with the ordinances that formed the basis of the parties' dispute. In affirming, the court held that the licensing ordinance's definitions were not unconstitutionally overbroad, as determined by a recently decided state supreme court case. The zoning setback did not rise to the level of a prior restraint because no evidence existed that it created a blanket prohibition on adult entertainment or limited the sites available for such clubs. The setback was also a valid time, place, and manner restriction, as it was carefully tailored to meet the important and legitimate government goals of consistency in zoning and minimizing the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment, including those from entertainment by male performers. Moreover, by knowingly stipulating to the injunction, the corporation waived its right to raise its constitutional challenge as a defense to its violation of the injunction.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant to six months in jail on each count, to be served concurrently, and ordered him to pay $ 10,000 in fines on each count.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Fish and Wildlife officials alleged that defendant illegally sold sockeye salmon on three separate days from catch area 7 at a time when the fishery was open only to treaty Indian fishermen. Defendant admitted that he was not a treaty Indian, but that he was married to a treaty Indian and that he was assisting his wife in exercising her treaty fishing rights. Defendant's wife was not with him on any of the three occasions in questions. Defendant's wife owned the boat from which defendant fished. Defendant used a state-issued commercial fishing license containing a tribal code to sell his catches. Defendant alleged that the unlawful participation statute was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority and was void for vagueness. The court affirmed the trial court and held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 75.12.320 was consistent with the signal cases interpreting Indian treaty fishing rights, the pertinent provisions of the Yakama tribal code, and other applicable federal law. The grant of Indian treaty fishing rights did not extend to non-treaty Indians unless the treaty Indian was present and was being assisted by individuals who were not treaty Indians.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After emergency personnel were unable to revive the parents' two-year-old son, an autopsy revealed that he died of a blunt trauma to his abdomen. The other children were taken into protective custody; the van driver testified at the dependency hearing that the oldest child said that the father disciplined the two-year-old by stepping on him. Under the dependency and dispositional orders, the mother was permitted to be reunited with the children, but the father was ordered not to reside in the home or have unsupervised contact with them. The court affirmed. The oldest child's statements did not qualify for the excited utterance exception from the hearsay rule as they were made too long after the stressful event, but admission of the statements was harmless error. The orders were based on medical evidence showing the injury was not accidental. The parents received a meaningful hearing. No advisory jury consisting of members of the Muslim community was required. Substantial evidence supported the orders. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.030(4)(c) was narrowly drawn to serve the compelling state interest in protecting children and was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed judgments from the Superior Court of Clark County (Washington), which convicted them of first degree escape when they failed to report to partial confinement with a work crew. Defendants argued that they never reported to work crew and, thus, were not in the state's custody at the time of their failure to report.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were sentenced to partial confinement with a work crew. Neither reported to the work crew and they never contacted corrections officials. They were convicted of first degree escape. Defendants argued that their failure to report to work crew was not an &quot;escape from custody&quot; and that their convictions violated their right to equal protection. One defendant also challenged the conversion of his work crew sentence to incarceration as a violation of double jeopardy. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held defendant's status hinged on their obligation to be in custody by being physically present at a particular time and place. It did not turn on their custody status proceeding the ordered custody date. Thus, their custody status immediately before their work release sentences was not relevant. The court also found no equal protection violation. Finally, the court determined that defendant was not double punishment for the same criminal act, i.e., failing to report to the work crew.

The officer argued that his action was permitted under the Law Enforcement Officers' and Fire Fighters' Retirement System Act (LEOFF). The trial court held the officer's remedy was under the Industrial Insurance Act (Act).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer was injured when a police dog bit him on the arm while he was on duty. He received worker's compensation benefits but argued that the award was inadequate. The officer brought a negligence action against the city, and the trial court granted the city's motion for judgment on the pleadings, but denied the city's request for attorney fees. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. The court held that: 1) the officer's appeal was sufficiently clear to merit review; 2) although the Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.04.010, was more recent than the LEOFF, the provisions of the LEOFF, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.26, were more explicit and unambiguous and therefore prevailed over the Act; 3) the &quot;right to sue&quot; provision of the LEOFF applied to the officer prior to the legislature's 1992 amendment of the LEOFF; and 4) because the amendment was unconstitutional, it was inapplicable to the officer. Finally, on the city's challenge of the trial court's denial of fees and costs, the court held that the city was no longer the prevailing party, and therefore not entitled to such fees and costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general contractor hired a drywall subcontractor for a project to construct a school. A dispute arose between the parties which was handled by an arbitrator, who advised that he intended to find in favor of the subcontractor. Prior to the arbitrator's decision, the subcontractor filed a claim against the retainage held by the district. The trial court granted the general contractor's motion for summary dismissal of the claim because the parties had submitted all their disputes to the arbitrator. The general contractor subsequently filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award. The subcontractor filed a motion to modify the arbitration award to include attorney fees or, in the alternative, for vacation and remand for the arbitrator to award it attorney fees. The trial court confirmed the arbitration award without modification and the court affirmed on appeal. The court found that the claim that was submitted to the arbitrator did not constitute a lien foreclosure under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 60.28.030, therefore, there was no basis to give rise to a fee award. The court found that as required by &sect; 60.28.030 the arbitrator did not have before him a proceeding to enforce a lien.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county cited the property owners for zoning violations because they were using a travel trailer as their full time residence and because they had multiple travel trailers on their property. The trial court granted summary judgment to the county and restrained the owners from placing more than one travel trailer on the property and from occupying the property for more than six months. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that there were no genuine issues of material fact because it was undisputed that the property owners were living permanently in a travel trailer, that they had multiple travel trailers on their lot, and that the property was designated as a special flood hazard area. The court found that the statute was not void for vagueness and the definition of &quot;travel trailer&quot; was not overly broad. The court rejected the property owners' assertion that their property was taken without compensation finding that a zoning regulation was not a taking when it was imposed to protect the public health and safety.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Kitsap County (Washington), which denied his motion for reconsideration regarding the ruling on his motion for suppression and his conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver within 1,000 feet of a school bus stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped near a school bus stop for a cracked windshield. The officer discovered that defendant had a suspended license, arrested him, and found drugs in the car. Defendant confessed to intending to deliver the drugs. Defendant's motion to suppress was denied in part on a finding that defendant had crossed a double yellow centerline. The officer later told the prosecutor that there was no double yellow line. The trial court granted a motion to remove this finding, but denied defendant's motion for reconsideration. On appeal, the court remanded for a hearing on the validity of the stop. Because the change to the findings was substantive and the validity of the stop for a cracked windshield required further consideration, the court held that defendant was entitled to a hearing under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 7.8(c)(2). If the stop was valid, the court ruled that the officer could arrest defendant for a suspended license and could search the car and that the evidence in the car was the corpus delicti for defendant's confession. The court found sufficient evidence of the school bus stop and that the enhancement was constitutional as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

If the denial of defendant's motion to suppress was affirmed, the trial court was to affirm the conviction, and if reversed, the trial court was to reverse the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police asked to search the crawl space below defendant's house. Defendant was present when his father consented to the search and did not object.

Forensic evidence showed that the victim had been beaten on the head, rendered unconscious, and then strangled. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to 47 years. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that because defendant's father consented to the search and because he had a superior interest in the house and in the area searched, the police had not needed defendant's consent before searching the crawl space. The court further held that defendant's confession was not coerced, that the defendant properly was tried as an adult, that there was sufficient evidence that the murder was premeditated, that the trial court's use of victim vulnerability as an aggravating factor was not clearly erroneous, and that, given the brutality of the crime and the vulnerability of the victim, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to 47 years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer approached defendant while he was working on his pickup.

As defendant was previously convicted of harassment, he was arrested, charged, and ultimately convicted of possessing firearms in violation of &sect; 9.41.040. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court rejected defendant's contention that certain amendments to &sect; 9.41.040 were unconstitutional because they were part of a bill embracing more than one subject and they were vague. The court held that the particular section that amended &sect; 9.41.040 was clearly related to the act's title and to its primary purpose of violence prevention. The court held that Wash. Const. art. II, sec. 19 was not violated by the amendments to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040. The court also held that &sect; 9.41.040, in clear and simple terms, barred the possession of firearms by individuals previously convicted of certain specified crimes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two property owners, a husband and wife, applied for a shoreline substantial development permit. The town's permit administrator issued the permit with an easement condition. The property owners appealed, and before the appeal hearing, the town deleted the easement requirement. The revised permit was filed with the Department of Ecology (department). Because of the department's 30-day review period, the property owners could not begin construction until late November when weather conditions made it impractical to do so. The court affirmed summary judgment in favor of the town. The property owners could not recover under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, because they were not deprived of a federally protected right. The delay in obtaining the permit was not sufficient to establish a substantive due process claim. The property owners could not maintain a negligent hiring claim against the town because they failed to show that the imposition of the easement was due to the permit administrator's lack of training. Because the condition was consistent with the town's shoreline program, the permit administrator's poor job performance was not the proximate cause of the property owners' damages.</SPAN></P>

Defendant subsequently cancelled payment on both checks and refused to issue the heating equipment company new checks or to return the equipment. Defendant was convicted of two counts of first degree theft and two counts of unlawful issuance of bank checks. Defendant claimed on appeal that his convictions for both offenses were prohibited by the double jeopardy clause of U.S. Const. amend. V and the merger doctrine. The court rejected defendant's claims. The court ruled that double jeopardy did not apply because the offenses of first degree theft under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9A.56.020(b), 9A.56.020(1)(a) and unlawful issuance of bank checks under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.56.060 were separate crimes that required proof of separate elements that were punishable separately. The court also ruled that the merger doctrine did not apply because first degree theft did not require proof of the unlawful issuance of bank checks and because the unlawful issuance of bank checks did not depend upon the presence or absence of theft.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold drops of LSD to three minors. The court affirmed his convictions for three counts of delivery. The court held that the jury instruction defining knowledge did not allow the jury to find knowledge based on a high probability of the existence of a fact, but required the jury to find that defendant acted with actual, subjective knowledge in order to convict him. The first offender waiver was not available to defendant because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9094A.030(22)(a) specifically excluded anyone convicted of selling LSD from the definition of first-time offender. The trial court did not err in calculating defendant's offender score because his convictions did not involve the same criminal conduct. Although the convictions involved the same time and place, they involved three different victims. Each transaction had as its objective the sale of LSD to a different purchaser. The purpose of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.406 was to punish deliveries to minors. His sentence, which imposed a 120-month prison sentence and 12-month community supervision did not exceed the statutory maximum because if he served the entire prison sentence he would not be subject to community supervision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered the home of a 15 year old boy, raped him, and stole money. He was in jail on another rape charge when he told the story of the rape to another inmate who then reported him by writing a letter to the prosecutor. The court held that the letter was admissible and was not hearsay, because it was consistent with the declarant's testimony at trial. The court held that a doctor's testimony as to time, as reported by the victim was admissible under the hearsay exception for statement made for medical diagnosis. The court held defendant was not entitled to a mistrial because of the admission of evidence of other crimes committed by him. The court held that it was highly unlikely that the admission of an unconstitutionally obtained prior conviction influenced the outcome of the present case, and the trial court did not err in refusing to grant a new trial on that basis. The court remanded defendant's sentence. The sentence was potentially subject to the presumption of judicial vindictiveness because it was a sentence imposed following a partially successful appeal. The court held that defendant had to be given a sentence not more severe than the original sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that (1) the privileged document was intercepted by the State during its investigation of defendant and it was defendant's burden to show application of the attorney-client privilege because the Sixth Amendment was not implicated; (2) defendant failed to show that the trial court's suppression of the privileged document was an inadequate remedy; (3) defendant was properly charged under general statutes because the special log patrol statute did not punish conduct that was also punishable under general statutes and thus, the special statute was not concurrent with the general statutes; and (4) the merger doctrine did not apply to defendant's theft and stolen property convictions because those crimes could not be elevated to a higher degree by proof of another crime proscribed elsewhere in the criminal code.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor was arrested after police officers warned him that he would be cited if he refused to leave an area that had a curfew. The court granted the state's request to dismiss the conviction but review was still appropriate under the mootness doctrine. The court found the curfew ordinance unconstitutional, as it infringed upon minors' fundamental freedom of movement and expression and was not narrowly tailored to address the problem of juvenile crime. Although the curfew ordinance satisfied the first prong of the strict scrutiny test because crime prevention and protecting minors from becoming victims were sufficiently compelling interests, the ordinance was not narrowly tailored to meet the government's purpose. There was not a sufficient nexus between the curfew and juvenile victimization or crime rates to withstand strict scrutiny, as the only evidence before the court showed that the curfew had no impact at all on juvenile crime. The ordinance was also unconstitutionally vague, as it was unclear about what was and what was not an exempted activity.</SPAN></P>

The youth and advocate challenged the anti-sitting ordinance on several state constitutional grounds after being cited for violation of the ordinance. The youth and advocate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When cited for violating the anti-sitting ordinance, the youth was panhandling and the advocate was leafleting. The court affirmed their convictions. The court stated that although the state's constitution expressly acknowledged that governments were established to protect individual rights, the state constitution also permitted municipalities to make and enforce police and public health regulations. Consequently, the court held that the ordinance furthered a legitimate police power interest in a manner that infringed only minimally on the youth's and advocate's freedom of movement. The court found that (1) because neither the youth nor advocate was engaged in expressive conduct when arrested, the court need not decide whether the ordinance was a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction on speech; (2) because sitting did not have an inherent expressive value the ordinance was not overbroad; (3) although the ordinance exempted patrons of commercial establishments and hence created classes, the ordinance applied to all members of each class in the same way and the distinction it drew was a rational one; and (4) the ordinance did not implicate the right to travel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted robbery, eluding police officers, and taking a motor vehicle without permission and a separate jury sentenced him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act's persistent offender provisions (SRA-POP), Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.94A.120(4), 9.94A.030(23), and 9.94A.030(27). The court affirmed the convictions and sentence and found that the lower court properly refused to sever the offenses because the evidence was particularly strong for the most serious charge, the defenses were simple denials, and defendant demonstrated no prejudice. The court determined that it was not erroneous to admit two exhibits establishing defendant's prior California convictions because the relevant documents were self-authenticating. The court concluded that defendant's sentence under SRA-POP was not cruel and unusual under the state constitution because the crimes he was convicted of were violent and involved risk of injury to persons. The court found that defendant did not have a state due process right to challenge the constitutionality of his earlier strikes during the sentencing proceeding for his third strike.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that defendant's counsel did not violate the exclusionary rule when his cross-examination questions referred to the suppressed fruits of an illegal search. The court found that the admission of evidence of examinations of boys that were not the subject of criminal charges was not error as the trial court understood that the defense would not and did not object to these witnesses as part of its trial strategy. The court concluded that the prosecutor did not commit misconduct by eliciting testimony that when female witnesses were at defendant's home, he was not interested in them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The architect was named as a third party defendant by the builder that had been sued by the customer. The architect filed an answer and answered interrogatories. Then, the matter was submitted to binding arbitration. The architect did not appear at the arbitration hearing, and the builder was awarded damages on his third party complaint. The architect then demanded a jury trial de novo, which the trial court denied because of his failure to appear at the arbitration hearing. The architect appealed, asserting violations of due process and the right to a jury trial. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of a jury trial de novo. The court held that there was no denial of due process as alleged. The right to a trial de novo could be conditioned on participation in an evidentiary hearing at the arbitration stage without such a constitutional violation occurring. Further, there was no denial of the right to a jury trial. Rather, the architect waived that right by his failure, without good cause, to participate in the arbitration process.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting testimony concerning polygraphs. The court then held that, because defendant did not contemporaneously object to the State's remarks they were reviewed to determine whether it was so flagrant and ill intentioned that it causes an enduring and resulting prejudice that it could not be neutralized by an admonition to the jury. Applying such a standard, the court held that the State's comments did not warrant reversal. The court then held that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction under the enhancement statute. The court found that an officer's pacing of the distance between the location of the offense and the school was sufficient to establish the distance element under the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner sought preliminary plat approval to subdivide a parcel of real property into single-family residential lots. The city council voted to approve the plat on condition that the landowner would be required to construct a temporary storm drainage system. The landowner sought judicial review by filing a petition for writ of certiorari within the 30-day time limit of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 58.17.180. The trial court found that the petition was untimely under Puyallup, Wash., Municipal Code &sect; 2.54.140, which provided only a 10-day period to appeal the city council's action. The court reversed, observing that when more than one appeal period applied, the longer period generally controlled. Moreover, a city could exercise only such power as was delegated to it by the legislature, and the legislature had not explicitly delegated to municipalities the task of setting time limits for judicial review of land use decisions. Consequently, the ordinance was void to the extent that it conflicted with state law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also contended that the search warrant's supporting affidavit was insufficient. In affirming the conviction and sentence, the court held that the trial court was authorized, under the Sentencing Reform Act, Wash. Rev.

Moreover, each of the conditions, including the condition prohibiting unapproved contact with minors, gave sufficient notice of what conduct was prohibited and were not overbroad or vague. Finally, defendant failed to show that the search warrant's supporting affidavit was insufficient because the affiant's failure to expressly state that the affiant learned his information from the victim's mother did not constitute a material omission.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant initially claimed that the animal cruelty statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 16.52.205 was vague. The court pointed out that the statute established three separate and distinct acts that amounted to first degree animal cruelty. The court found that defendant's actions were clearly prohibited under the first two alternatives. Section 16.52.205 provided in part that a person was guilty of animal cruelty in the first degree when he or she intentionally inflicts substantial pain on an animal or causes physical injury to an animal. Defendant also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction. The court thought that defendant's own testimony was enough evidence to support a conviction based on causing physical injury to the kitten.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ski corporation previously entered into an exclusive 20-year agreement with the state to operate a sports, recreation, and ski area in a state park. The ski corporation held a possessory interest in the ski lifts and other improvements in the concession area. After the county subsequently created the public development authority (authority) to operate the ski concession at the state park, the ski corporation filed an action in superior court, seeking a declaration that the authority was an illegal entity, and that the statute that gave the county permission to create the authority, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.21.730, was unconstitutional. The superior court granted summary judgment against the ski corporation. The court affirmed, holding that because the authority, as a public corporation, met two of the purposes set out in &sect; 35.21.730, the authority was validly created by the county. The court noted that the authority's operation of the ski area constituted a public purpose and function. The court further concluded that the county did not abuse its discretion in creating the authority and delegating its powers to it to remedy the problems with the concessions at the ski area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for engaging in sexual intercourse with his 14-year old niece. The evidence included a provocative photograph of the girl, found during a warrantless search of defendant's wallet. The wallet was taken from defendant's person at the time of arrest, but was not search until three hours later. The court stated that the delay was reasonable because it resulted from special arrangements the officers made to accommodate defendant's status as a police officer, and that the search was lawful as incident to a valid arrest. Because the inventoried wallet was inventoried for the legitimate purpose of protecting against a fraudulent claim of theft, the court held that the wallet search of the wallet was valid as an inventory search. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by imposing an exceptional sentence. The niece was sent to live with defendant because she was having serious problems including drug and alcohol abuse, failure to attend school, and engaging in sexual relations with numerous young men. The exceptional sentence was justified under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(2), in view of the niece's status as an &quot;at risk&quot; child and defendant's abuse of trust.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county appealed the orders of the Superior Court of Pierce County (Washington), which denied its motions for summary judgment and judgment notwithstanding the verdict in an action by plaintiff homeowners, as assignee of defendant builders, for damages caused by negligent building inspections. The trial court submitted the issue of the public duty doctrine to the jury, which gave judgment against the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action over the grossly deficient construction of a new home, only a cross-claim of the builders against the county, assigned by the homeowners, remained at trial. On appeal, the court reversed the denial of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because it also was dispositive of the summary judgment issue. The court held that the public duty doctrine provided that a government was not liable to individuals except in certain circumstances and relieved the government from liability for negligence. The court held that the doctrine did not apply to proprietary functions, but that building inspection was a governmental function. The doctrine was not a grant of immunity, but rather defined the persons to whom a government owed an actionable duty for negligence. The court held that under the &quot;special relationship&quot; exception, a government could be liable to an individual when the individual made specific inquiries of an official, the official answered, and the individual relied on the answers. The court held that building inspections were not warranties of code compliance and created no special duty absent specific representations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that there was no evidence of a special relationship between the homeowners or builder and the county, and the trial court erred when it did not grant the county's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict based on the public duty doctrine. The court also held that the failure-to-enforce doctrine and legislative intent exceptions did not apply. The court reversed the judgment against the county.</SPAN></P>

In 1995, they filed the judgment in Superior Court of Spokane County (Washington). Pursuant to Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question was whether execution of the bankruptcy court judgment qualified for an extension under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 6.17.020. The court held that it did not and affirmed the trial court. The creditors argued that pursuant to &sect; 6.36.025(1) foreign judgments filed in superior court were to be enforced in the same manner as a judgment of the superior court. The creditors' bankruptcy judgment was not rendered by a court of record in Washington. They were not, therefore, entitled to an extension. Section 6.17.020 unambiguously required that a judgment be rendered by a court of record of Washington and that application for the extension be made to the court rendering the judgment. The trial court correctly refused to extend the time for execution. Section 6.36.025 implemented the constitutional requirement of full faith and credit. It provided that any properly authenticated foreign judgment filed in superior court could be enforced like any state superior court judgment. The creditors' bankruptcy judgment could be &quot;enforced&quot; like any other state superior court judgment. It was only the time within which that judgment had to be enforced that could not be extended.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer attempted to stop a car occupied by four young men. The car did not stop immediately, but soon pulled up in front of the home of one of the passengers. The officer began to ticket the driver for having a defective license plate lamp.

The minor was booked for harassment, obstruction, and hindering. On appeal, the minor and his mother contended that one of the jury instructions allowed the jury to find obstruction of a police officer based on mere speech. The superior court's refusal to consider giving a limiting instruction may have been reversible error had the minor proposed one that did not go to the opposite extreme. However, the minor failed to preserve any error there may have been in the instruction. Therefore, the court affirmed the ruling of the superior court.</SPAN></P>

The employer alleged that this claim was barred by collateral estoppel because it had been ruled upon in a prior action in federal court. The Superior Court, Spokane County (Washington) granted the employer's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint. The employee sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer claimed that the federal court's finding that the employee had no property interest in his position because he was an at-will employee collaterally estopped him from litigating this wrongful termination claim in state court. The employee claimed that collateral estoppel did not apply because the issue in state court was not identical with that in federal court, where there was no final judgment, and because application of the doctrine would be unjust. The court rejected the employee's claim and affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court found that, in granting the employer summary judgment, the federal court specifically concluded that the employee was an at-will employee with no property interest in his position, and that the issue in the state court was the same. The court also found that the federal court's dismissal on summary judgment was a final judgment on the merits and that issues decided on summary judgment were accorded preclusive effect. The court also held that there was no injustice because the evidence established that the employee had no property interest in his position because the employer could terminate him at will, instead of for cause.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgments, finding that defendants did not meet their burden of proving that the statute was unconstitutionally void as applied to them. The court held that The Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 structured discretionary decisions affecting sentences and required the sentencing court to articulate reasons for any exceptional sentence as a limit to the judge's discretion. Thus, while a justification for an exceptional sentence was necessarily subjective, a sentencing court's discretion was not arbitrary. Further, because standard range and exceptional sentences were determined on an individualized basis with reference to the conduct of the defendant, equal protection was not violated by differing sentences for different offenders committing the same crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police were investigating a narcotics incident and were interviewing people at the crime scene. They interviewed defendant and told him he was free to go. He chose to remain at the scene and screamed obscenities at the officers and threatened to kill them. The officers told him that if he did not leave he would be arrested. When he still did not leave, they arrested him. He was convicted of obstructing a public officer in violation of &sect; 12A.16.010(A)(5). On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally overbroad because it did not limit what a person could say to police officers, nor did it limit a person's ability to observe what police were doing at a public crime scene. Rather, a violation of the ordinance was triggered only by refusing to comply with an order to leave the scene of an investigation, not by an exercise of free speech rights. The court also found that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because it did not allow police unfettered discretion to tell a person observing public police action to move on; rather, it required that before a person could be told to leave, he must have acted in a way that obstructed an officer.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 26.19.075(1)(d), a statute disallowing a residential credit to noncustodial parents when the custodial parent received Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), was unconstitutional and granted defendant father a reduction in child support without having made specific findings of fact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state brought an action for child support against the father, and he requested a deviation from the child support schedule for a residential credit. Section 26.19.075(1)(d) disallowed a residential credit to noncustodial parents when the custodial parent received AFDC. The trial court held that &sect; 26.19.075(1)(d) was unconstitutional under a rational basis test. The court reversed. The statute was presumed to be constitutional, and the court rejected a strict scrutiny and intermediate scrutiny test. Although maintaining a relationship with one's child was a fundamental right that would require a strict scrutiny analysis, &sect; 26.19.075(1)(d) did not directly and substantially interfere with that right. Intermediate scrutiny was usually used when physical liberty was at stake. The statute passed the rational basis test in that the law affected an entire class of noncustodial parents whose children received AFDC, there were reasonable grounds to distinguish that class based on laws that required reimbursement by AFDC recipients, and there was a rational relationship to a state interest in requiring parents, rather than the state, to support their children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision that determined the statute to have been unconstitutional.

Thus, the state department of licensing (DOL) did not establish jurisdiction for its revocation of his driver's license. On review, the court disagreed. The DOL had authority under prior Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.308(6) (1986) to revoke a licensee's driving privilege upon receipt of a sworn report of a law enforcement officer stating that, after valid warnings, the licensee refused to take a breathalyzer test. The terms &quot;law enforcement officer&quot; and &quot;arresting officer&quot; included any officer empowered to enforce the law. The court also found that the state lost jurisdiction to regulate within federal property only where state and federal law conflicted. The suspension or revocation of a driver's license was not penal in nature and was not intended as punishment, but was designed solely for the protection of the public in the use of the highways. There was no double jeopardy violation because defendant was already punished in federal court.</SPAN></P>

The county brought a civil forfeiture action against defendant, but it was dismissed for lack of evidence. The state filed criminal charges, including crimes listed as predicate acts from the prior action. Defendant sought a motion to dismiss. The court denied his motion, finding the decision in the civil case was not a final judgment on the merits and the doctrine of collateral estoppel created an injustice. After a mistrial, a second trial resulted in defendant's conviction. He appealed. The court held the double jeopardy argument lacked merit and that all the elements for a collateral estoppel had not been proven. The court agreed that there were compelling public policy considerations supporting the trial court's refusal to apply the doctrine. The issue of vindictiveness failed where Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.82.100 contemplated both civil and criminal prosecutions. Evidence was sufficient to prove a pattern of criminal profiteering activity and trial testimony was sufficient to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant acquired $ 500,000 by engaging in predicate acts.</SPAN></P>

The county's use the fee revenues covered the costs to issue the permits and monitor water quality, which did not violate due process. The fees were not excessive and did not violate Rev. Wash.

The trial court imposed an exceptional sentence, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed defendant's sentence, holding that the trial court had properly extended defendant's sentence because the operation of the multiple offense policy of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.400 resulted in a clearly too lenient sentence. The trial court also properly considered the fact that defendant bore extraordinary culpability as an aggravating factor. The court further determined that, although the trial court improperly based defendant's sentence on the permanent, multiple, and life devastating injuries sustained by the victims, resentencing was unnecessary, because the trial court made it clear that it would have imposed the same sentence even without reliance upon the improper factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.110 was unconstitutionally vague due to its use of the term &quot;repeatedly&quot; and the phrase of &quot;knows or reasonably should know.&quot; Defendant also claimed that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.110(1)(c)(ii) was void for vagueness, overbroad, prohibited protected activity, and violated due process and equal protection. Defendant finally claimed there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. The court determined that the evidence showed that defendant was seen by the victim on two separate occasions, during which time he followed her in his van and watched her as she was shopping, which was sufficient to convict him. The court held that &sect; 9A.46.110(1)(c)(ii) was sufficiently specific to let defendant know what conduct was prohibited and the activities prohibited were not protected by U.S. Const. amend. I.

Defendant also sought to suppress the rock cocaine that was obtained during a strip search. Both motions were denied. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) &sect; 10.15.020(c) was constitutional because it passed the common intelligence test of the void-for-vagueness doctrine and officer arbitrariness in enforcement was diminished by the fact that that the arresting officers were required to observe overt conduct consistent with the intent to engage in drug-related activity additional to loitering; (2) the arrest was valid because any reasonable officer could have made the arrest based on the observations of defendant's suspicious behavior; (3) the second strip search was legal because it was conducted in a reasonable manner and was based on objectively reasonable suspicion and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.79.130(2)(c); and (4) the prosecutor did not commit misconduct because his comment that the officers' testimony was not misleading was an inference from the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the police officers attempted to restrain defendant, he struggled, attempted to break away, and continued to swear at the officers.

The officers observed defendant's bloodied face and muddy clothing. The court found that the officers had a well-founded suspicion that defendant was connected to criminal activity. Consequently, the officers were justified in asking defendant to stop so that they could investigate. Also, although the information cited a revised version of obstructing not yet effective at the time police apprehended defendant, the information notified him of all necessary elements of the correct version of the crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendants had received the appropriate implied consent warnings before they provided their initial breath samples. However, when it was discovered that the blood alcohol testing machines were malfunctioning, the police officers took additional breath samples for analysis without renewing the implied consent warnings. The lower court found that the state had exceeded its lawful authority by administering the second tests. Upon review, the court reversed. It found that the purpose of the test was to achieve accurate results. The court held that Wash. Rev.

Further, the court held that under &sect; 46.20.308, a person was deemed to have given consent to a valid, accurate, reliable test or tests and renewed implied consent warnings were not necessary when a disruption of a test was caused by a malfunctioning equipment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The law firm represented the client in a personal injury action. When the fees were not paid, the law firm filed suit, and the case was sent for mandatory arbitration. The arbitrator awarded judgment to the law firm against the clients but not against the parents. The law firm sought to request a limited trial de novo under Rule 7.1(a) of only the claim against the parents. The parents filed a motion to strike for failure to include the claim against the daughter. The superior court denied the motion and a motion for reconsideration. The parents appealed. The court reversed and agreed with the parents that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.06.050 barred a request for a trial de novo of less than all the issues and parties to the arbitration proceeding. The language &quot;all issues of law and fact&quot; in &sect; 7.06.050 was plain on its face and prohibited the law firm's attempts to limit the parties and issues. The court declined to base its holding on the policy considerations advanced by the parties because the language of &sect; 7.06.050 clearly permitted no other construction. The court rejected the law firm's construction of &sect; 7.06.050 because it would have rendered part of the statute superfluous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers removed five occupants from a car after the car turned onto a highway without signaling and a passenger was seen looking back and bending down as if trying to hide something. The officers obtained consent to search. They found a pistol wrapped in defendant's jacket under the right front passenger seat, which he claimed was not his. The State charged defendant with unlawful possession of a firearm. The juvenile court rejected the defense's contention that the evidence showed only momentary handling of the gun. Defendant was convicted and he appealed. The court held that the right to bear arms under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 24 was subject to reasonable regulation under the State's police power. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040(1)(e) restricted the right to bear arms by making it unlawful for a person under 18 to have a firearm in his or her possession or control. The facts supported the juvenile court's finding that defendant exerted dominion and control beyond that associated with momentary handling. The court found defendant had shown no infirmity in &sect; 9.41.040(1)(e) as applied to his conduct and his facial challenge was not accompanied by a demonstration of standing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The revenue department assessed a use tax on the taxpayer's acquisition of its fleet of trucks. The taxpayer appealed the assessment contending that various use tax exemptions were applicable. An administrative law judge (ALJ) upheld the assessment. The taxpayer appealed the ALJ's determination to the trial court. The trial court granted the revenue department's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the use tax statute, former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.12.0254, was not unconstitutionally vague and that the revenue department did not exceed its authority in applying the statute or in determining that the trucks did not qualify for an exemption from the use tax. The court ruled that &sect; 82.12.0254 was not the proper subject of a constitutional vagueness challenge because it neither forbade nor required the taxpayer to act. The court declined to sanction the revenue department by treating its responses as admissions because the taxpayer never asked the trial court to determine if the revenue department's responses to the request for admissions were sufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Law Enforcement Officers' and Fire Fighters' Retirement System (LEOFF) provided benefits to injured workers and gave LEOFF members or their survivors the right to sue governmental employers for any excess of damages over the amount received for injuries resulting from the employers' intentional or negligent acts. Thereafter, the system was reorganized and the right to sue was listed as applicable to both LEOFF I and LEOFF II. The legislature again recodified the provision to limit the right to sue to LEOFF I members only. Appellants then brought suit to obtain a judgment declaring that they had the right to sue their employer for negligently causing work-related injuries. The trial court dismissed the action because no fire fighters were alleged to have been injured and denied the ability to sue. The court affirmed the judgment. It found that the dispute was possible or potential, rather than actual, as neither of the two individual fire fighters suffered any workplace injuries for which they wished to sue their employer and the union did not claim to be representing any such person.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court held that the consent defense was not limited to conduct within the rules of the games; rather it was applicable to the conduct and harm that were the reasonably foreseeable hazards of joint participation in an athletic contest. The court found that defendant's conduct was not a reasonably foreseeable hazard. The magnitude and dangerousness of defendant's actions were beyond the limit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the forfeiture of her horses violated due process requirements because it contained no provisions for notice and an opportunity to be heard.

VIII. In affirming the convictions and the forfeiture, the court held that the statute that authorized the forfeiture of animals seized from a person convicted of cruelty to animals did not violate constitutional guaranties of due process, protections against double jeopardy, and it did not constitute an unjust fine. The court also held that &sect; 16.52.070 was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant because a rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, could conclude that defendant cruelly deprived her animals of necessary sustenance or knowingly failed to provide them with proper food.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 7.68, the crime victims' compensation act (CVCA), after respondent Washington's Department of Labor and Industries denied their claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants had been abused as children while residents of states other than Washington. They had repressed their memories of the abuse until after they had become residents of the state. They contended they were eligible for benefits under the CVCA because their injury occurred when they recovered their memories, at a time when they were Washington State residents. The court held that the residency requirement in the CVCA had to be satisfied at the time a criminal perpetrated an act. It also held that the CVCA's meaning was clear when the word &quot;resident&quot; was read in context with the words &quot;act committed.&quot; The applicants did not qualify for benefits because they were not residents of Washington State at the time the criminals perpetuated the criminal conduct. The court rejected the applicant's argument that the CVCA's accrual provision, relating to childhood victims who repressed conscious memory, expanded the pool of beneficiaries to include them. It found that the residency requirement in &sect; 7.68.020(2)'s second clause was bona fide and did not unconstitutionally burden interstate travel.</SPAN></P>

He argued that the undefined term of &quot;serious physical injury&quot; contained no ascertainable standards for adjudication, which left the trial judge and the jury to decide arbitrarily whether defendant was guilty of first-degree rape. The court held that although some discretion was inherent in the task of defining an injury as &quot;serious,&quot; the subjective nature of the term did not violate constitutional principles because the need for a subjective evaluation of that term did not invite an inordinate amount of discretion. Finally, the court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to give defendant's proposed jury instruction on the issue of serious physical injury because it did not accurately state the law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were cited for failing to wear motorcycle helmets pursuant to a statute that had previously been found as unconstitutionally vague.

In reaching its conclusion, the court held defendants' lacked standing to challenge the helmet statute. The court held that, because the challenge did not involve First Amendment issues, the statute was examined under the circumstances to which it was applied. Thus, the court held that, although the statute may have been unconstitutionally vague, it clearly mandated the wearing of helmets of some type.

The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that: (1) the issue of the state's obligation to prove a recent overt act was moot where the trial court ultimately required proof; (2) where the probable cause hearing was delayed because the detainee was not available, procedures were not disregarded; (3) the certificate of determination for probable cause contained detailed facts about the detainee's past convictions for sexual offenses; and (4) the petition could be amended to conform to the evidence at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a collision with a motorcycle. While he was being booked on suspicion of vehicular assault, defendant said he was taking hydrocodone (a controlled substance) for shoulder pain. A trooper obtained a search warrant and found two bottles, one prescribing an anti-inflammatory (naprosyn) to defendant, and another prescribing hydrocodone to defendant's girlfriend. Defendant contended that the criminal possession statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401, unconstitutionally shifted the burden of disproving an element of the crime to defendant. The court stated that the burden on defendant to prove he had a valid prescription for the hydrocodone was not unconstitutional. Defendant also contended that he should only have had to establish a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. Defendant's constructive possession of his girlfriend's medication was well established. The fact of constructive possession thus established, the burden shifted to defendant to prove lawful possession. The fact that defendant had a prescription for vicodin dated a year earlier did not constitute a preponderance of the evidence. Defendant failed to carry his burden of proving lawful possession.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with being a minor in possession of a firearm and with obstructing a public servant. The information describing the obstruction charge cited to a repealed statute. Defendant was convicted on both counts, and he appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the possession charge, but reversed the obstruction conviction. The court found that the information charging defendant with obstruction failed to notify him of the accusation with reasonable certainty. The information charged defendant with obstruction by conduct under a repealed statute, but the state proved the offense by showing obstruction by false statements. The court held that defendant's false statements did not constitute &quot;conduct&quot; under the current obstruction statute, and he could not be convicted of an uncharged alternative means of obstruction. Because the information did not provide defendant with notice of the legal elements necessary for a conviction, prejudice was presumed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of threatening to injure property, in violation of &sect; 9.61.160, after evidence was presented to the jury that he was arrested by deputies sent by a dispatcher after defendant called the dispatcher and threatened to burn down a store if its employees called and harassed his family. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. Under the first clause of &sect; 9.61.160, only proof of a threat to injure property, and not proof of intent, was required, and the plain meaning of the word &quot;threat&quot; included future or conditional threats. Nor did the statute require the statement to be a &quot;true&quot; threat. Further, there was no error in the court's refusal to give defendant's proposed instructions that the state must prove a serious and present threat intended to alarm the listener as they were inaccurate, and the instructions given accurately reflected the statute. Finally, &sect; 9.16.160 was not unconstitutionally overbroad and did not unduly limit protected speech.

Defendant maintained that the assault merged into the unlawful imprisonment because the assault was contemporaneous in time and place, was merely incidental thereto, and resulted in no greater injury than the unlawful imprisonment. Defendant contended that based on the merger of the two offenses his convictions for both violated the prohibition against double jeopardy. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions of both crimes. The court held that, while the merger doctrine was still in existence, it had no applicability to defendant's case. The court found that neither the unlawful imprisonment and fourth degree assault statutes expressly authorized cumulative punishment for acts committed in the commission of either crime, and that the &quot;same evidence&quot; test was satisfied because the elements of the two crimes were different and the statutes served to deter different types of injuries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, nonprofit associations and residents, sought review of a decision by the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which granted summary judgment to respondents, King County (county) and King County Rural Library District (library district), on all but one of appellants' claims challenging the county's decision to surplus property to permit construction of a regional branch library building on a certain land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contended that there were genuine issues of material fact about whether the county complied with its own requirements in declaring the property surplus and whether it adequately described the property. The court found that even if the manager changed her mind about property surplus only under pressure from the council, there was no basis for finding that the county acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in declaring the property surplus. The trial court properly granted summary judgment to respondents on both issues appellants' raised. Although the current structure of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 39.33.020 made the statute something less than a model of clarity, given the history of &sect; 39.33.020, the trial court did not err in concluding that the method provided for was alternative or permissive and that, therefore, the county was not required to comply with the provisions set forth in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 39.33. Because the surplus declaration and leasing decision were not actions that a court could have taken, the decisions were not quasi-judicial in nature and the appearance of fairness doctrine did not apply. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to respondents.</SPAN></P>

The state amended its petition and the trial court again found cause to detain him. The court affirmed defendant's civil commitment. Although the trial court should have held a hearing on the issue of probable cause to detain within 72-hours, reversal for failure to hold a probable cause hearing was not required when a party could not show that such failure affected the ultimate outcome of the trial. Defendant was afforded a full hearing on the issue of commitment, and the absence of the 72-hour hearing did not affect the ultimate outcome of the proceeding. Additionally, the legislature's decision to create this civil commitment process for sexually violent predators did not violate the separation of power doctrine because the decision to release a prisoner from custody resulting from his criminal conduct was also one of legislative creation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that because he was not provided a probable cause hearing within 72 hours, the proceeding should have been dismissed and that &sect; 71.09 proceedings violated the separation of power doctrine by encroaching on the Indeterminate Sentence Review Board's (ISRB) power to determine sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ISRB ordered defendant's release from prison. The State petitioned to commit defendant under &sect; 71.09 alleging that he was a sexually violent predator. The trial court declared &sect; 71.09 unconstitutional. Section 71.09 was upheld on appeal. Defendant claimed that because a probable cause hearing was not provided within 72 hours of the remand of the case, the proceedings should have been dismissed. The court affirmed. A person detained under &sect; 71.09 had to be given an opportunity to appear within 72 hours for a determination of whether probable cause existed to believe he was a sexually violent person. The trial court erred in denying the motion to dismiss based on the lack of a 72-hour hearing. However, the State would have been allowed to file a new petition, and reversal was not required when defendant could not show that the failure affected the ultimate outcome. Defendant was afforded an opportunity to appear before the trial court twice prior to trial and could not complain that he was deprived of due process. There was no violation of separation of powers because the decision to release a prisoner from custody and the civil commitment process were both legislatively created.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's duty to register was triggered at that time.

She told them the same story a few minutes later, after things had cooled down. At trial she changed her story. Between the trial and sentencing she married defendant. The trial court, as part of its sentence, ordered that defendant have no contact with the victim for ten years, but after learning of the marriage modified the provision to allow contact after defendant completed a treatment program for domestic violence batterers. The court held that the trial court properly admitted the police officers' testimony of what the victim told them as an excited utterance. The no-contact order did not impose an unconstitutional restriction on defendant's right to marry because the state had a compelling interest in preventing future crimes that was furthered by the order. The trial court had the authority under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(9)(c) to issue the order and also to make treatment a precondition for lifting the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested as a result of a narcotics sting operation. After his arrest he was strip searched and narcotics were found. At a pre-trial hearing, defendant moved to suppress the physical evidence arguing that the police did not have probable cause to arrest him. On appeal, the court held that there was a reasonable basis or suspicion for strip searching defendant. Both the crime for which defendant was arrested, possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, and his conduct prior to his arrest were sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion that he was carrying or concealing criminal evidence or contraband that would be discovered during a strip search. The police stripped searched defendant because he was seen with a baggie of suspected crack cocaine, but it was not visibly present at the time of his arrest, and the baggie was not found prior to the search. This, in conjunction with the other evidence of defendant's furtive movements in the car and his hand in the waistband of his pants, led police to believe that he had hidden the drugs in a common area that drug dealers use, the crotch or the buttocks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act required the legislative authority of certain counties to meet with its constituent city representative to establish a collaborative process to establish a countywide planning policy.

On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of all but one of the resident's claims on standing and justiciability grounds, finding that the case was not ripe because no legal rights had been impacted. As to equal protection, the court reasoned that the Act only required the cities to collaborate with the county before adopting their comprehensive plans. The statute did not alter the county's powers because it did not require the adoption of any specific policy. The statute did not create a new governmental body nor authorize the exercise of governmental powers that would implicate the one vote principle. The court found the Act facially constitutional, the resident's arguments too speculative, and that the Act was not an unconstitutional delegation of the legislature's power to local government.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the doctors' expert opinions that the cuts made on the victim's face were deliberate were properly admitted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner argued that the forfeiture constituted double jeopardy within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment and Wash.

The court found no double jeopardy violations, explaining that civil forfeiture was remedial for purposes of double jeopardy, except where the clearest proof indicated that an in rem civil forfeiture was so punitive either in purpose or effect as to have been equivalent to a criminal proceeding. The court noted that forfeiture under the knowledge provision of &sect; 6.13.070(1) did constitute punishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment and as such it was error for the lower court to have failed to conduct a proportionality analysis. The court concluded that the homestead exemption contained in &sect; 6.13.070(1) was not subject to forfeiture conducted pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.505.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A wrongful death action was brought against the alleged tortfeasor to recover damages for the deceased's death in a car accident.

The trial court correctly concluded that the deceased's father did not regularly contribute to the deceased's support within the meaning of &sect; 4.24.010. However, the Equal Rights Amendment to the Washington Constitution absolutely prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex and was not subject to even the narrow exceptions permitted under traditional &quot;strict scrutiny.&quot; The support proviso of &sect; 4.24.010 denied equal rights on account of sex, in violation of Washington's Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The county issued a determination of significance (DS) under the SEPA and required an environmental impact study pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.21C.031. The applicants withdrew their application but began work on the pond. The county issued a stop work order and the applicants submitted a new proposal. The county issued another DS and applicants sought a writ of review. The trial court granted summary judgment to the county. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that a statutory writ of review under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.16 was not available to the applicants because an adequate remedy existed under the SEPA. The court found that the applicants failed to demonstrate that the county acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner and that the statute of limitations on the Wash. Rev.

The court ruled that because the applicants' proposed use for the pond was not categorically exempt under the Wash. Admin.

The proposed sunroom was to extend five feet into the setback, but the entire rear wall was windows. A hearing officer for the city affirmed a determination that the proposed addition did not qualify as a &quot;minor structural element.&quot; The court affirmed the trial court's reversal, finding that the intruding portion of the sun room met the dictionary definition of &quot;bay window&quot; because it was made of a series of windows, formed a recess in the sunroom, and projected outward from the rear wall of the residence.

The court affirmed and found that the adequacy of an EIS was a legal question and thus could be reviewed de novo by the board. As the county hearing examiner did not review the adequacy of the EIS, the board was not limited to an appellate role in reviewing it. The EIS did not address the specific impact of truck traffic on the bicycle trail. It also did not discuss the feasibility of building direct access ramps. The court found that the directive encompassed the effect of additional truck traffic on bicyclists, pedestrians, and vehicle traffic and the supplemental EIS was justified. The court found that the board did not unilaterally require the construction company to build ramps as a condition of receiving a CUP. This was simply an alternative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city rezoned the ministries' property from commercial to residential.

The court held that: (1) where the ministries served process upon an administrative assistant rather than upon an appropriate city official, it failed to effect service upon the city and the trial court properly dismissed the action; (2) because the ministries raised a substantive due process claim in conjunction with a civil rights action, its claim was subject to a three-year statute of limitations; (3) where the ministries filed its action well within the three-year statutory period, the trial court erred in dismissing the action with prejudice; and (4) where the ministries' taking claim was filed well within prescriptive period, the trial court erred in ruling the claim was time-barred but properly dismissed the claim for want of ripeness where inverse condemnation proceedings had not occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a family picnic, defendant videotaped the clothed buttocks and genital regions of adults and children. When he returned home from the picnic, he told his seven-year-old daughter to take a bath and, over her request not to, videotaped her in the bathtub. He used the camera's zoom feature to zoom in on her vagina, and held the camera's focus on that part of her body for extended periods of time. Defendant later edited the video. Defendant contended that he did not take the video for his own sexual stimulation but to anger his girlfriend. Affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that the videotaped picnic scenes related to defendant's motivation. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by holding the picnic scenes to be more probative than prejudicial because they showed that defendant's intent was to alter his daughter's behavior so that she would exhibit herself for his sexual stimulation, and that the scenes of her vaginal area were a continuation of that prurient purpose. The court held that a reasonable juror could conclude that defendant's purpose in making and editing the videotape was for his own sexual stimulation.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 51.08.178(2) for purposes of computing his monthly wages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent employer hired the worker as a general farm laborer. Although the worker's pattern was to work from March to November, his job could be performed throughout the year. After the worker was injured, the Department awarded him monthly time loss compensation based on the conclusion that he was a seasonal worker. An industrial appeals judge (IAJ) reversed the Department's decision, and the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals affirmed. However, the trial court reversed the Board's decision. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the worker's employment was exclusively seasonal in nature because he never worked during the months of December, January, and February; (2) substantial evidence supported the trial court's finding that the worker's employment would not have existed during the cold-weather months; (3) the IAJ's denial of the worker's rebuttal testimony did not violate his due process rights because the rebuttal testimony was merely a repeat of his earlier testimony; and (4) the worker's equal protection rights were not violated because it was reasonable for the Department to distinguish between workers with seasonable employment and those who were employed full time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with stalking after they repeatedly followed women for whom they had romantic feelings. They contended that the stalking statute was overbroad and vague. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that although the word &quot;follow&quot; was not defined, its plain and ordinary meaning meant to deliberately and repeatedly correlate one's movements or appearances with another person's in order to have contact with the person. The court also determined that the statute was not vague because a reasonable person could look to identifiable sources of law defining when &quot;lawful authority&quot; existed to follow others. The court found no substantial impact on protected First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, activities because the stalking statute only applied to acts causing fear in the victim; hence, the statute was not overbroad. Although the statute contained an exception for licensed private detectives, the court found no equal protection violation because that distinction was not irrational.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retirees were police officers entitled to education pay in recognition of their bachelor's degrees. The Department advised the retirees that they were not entitled to benefits for the additional amount that they received as education pay. The Director concluded that education pay was not attached to their positions; therefore, it was not included in the calculation of their final average salary used to compute their retirement benefits. The retirees appealed to two different superior courts. One superior court affirmed and one reversed, and the cases were combined for appeal. On appeal, the court held that education pay was not included in &quot;basic salary.&quot; The retirees were entitled to retirement benefits under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.26.100, based upon the amounts of their final average salaries. Since Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.26.030(12)(a) did not explicitly address education pay, it was ambiguous as to whether such pay was &quot;basic&quot; or &quot;special&quot; salary or wages. The court concluded that the Department's interpretation of the statute was correct and education pay was excluded from basic salary for purposes of the retirement calculations.</SPAN></P>

Both parties sought review. The court reversed the judgment and held that: (1) under the Washington Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Wash. Rev.

It held that &quot;securities&quot; was given a broad definition under the statute, and thus, defendant's activities fell within the statutory definition.

The court found that the girl was unable to testify in defendant's presence, but was able to tell the truth outside of his presence even if he could hear her, as long as she could not see him. The court held that the trial court correctly applied &sect; 9A.44.150 because the two competency hearings showed that the child could not reasonably communicate at trial and was thus &quot;unavailable&quot; except through one-way, closed-circuit television. The court found that the statute was constitutional on its face and did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VI or Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22.

Defendant appealed an order of the Superior Court, King County (Washington), which imposed sentence and required defendant to submit to searches by a community correction officer as a condition to community placement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court sentenced defendant to seven months, with credit given for 115 days served, and ordered 12 months of community supervision. Defendant was ordered to refrain from using drugs and to submit to testing and searches of his person, residence, and vehicle to monitor compliance. Defendant challenged the community placement order, arguing that any search had to be based on reasonable cause. On appeal, the court affirmed the sentence, ruling that defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the order until he was subjected to a search that he deemed unreasonable. On the merits, the court indicated that the order did not violate Washington law, which recognized an exception to the search warrant requirement to search parolees or probationers. Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.195, officers had to have a well-founded suspicion, not probable cause, to conduct such searches. Thus, as a matter of law, the legal standard for adjudicating a challenge to any search under the community placement order was reasonable suspicion. The failure to include language that any search must be based on reasonable suspicion did not affect the order's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A developer entered into an agreement to purchase the property owners' properties for development of a shopping center, contingent upon the issuance of approvals for development.

The owners were unable to overcome the presumption that their fill proposal was the least environmentally damaging alternative. One was compelled to file bankruptcy. On appeal, the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the state and county in the owners' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 civil rights action. The burden upon a claimant who asserted that the government had taken his or her property required proof that the enforcement of a regulation proximately caused the loss of all economic viability of the claimant's property. In addition, there must have been a showing that the claimant had exhausted all available remedies or that resort to such remedies would be futile.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Superior Court of Spokane County, Washington, denying his motion for relief from a consecutive sentence imposed upon a conviction entered on his plea of guilty to conspiracy to commit second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was subject to a federal prison sentence, the trial court sentenced him to the statutory maximum, to run consecutively to the prior federal sentence. The federal sentence was reversed. On remand, the federal district court, considering the subsequent state conviction, ordered a sentence of the same length as it initially imposed. Defendant moved for relief from the state sentence, more than a year after it was entered. The trial court denied the motion as untimely. On appeal, the court held that the one-year limit provided by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090 did not apply because it expressly applied only if the judgment and sentence was valid on its face. The sentence was valid when entered; it referred to a federal sentence previously imposed, a necessary predicate under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.400(3). However, when the federal sentence was reversed, there was no previously imposed sentence on which the state sentence could have operated. Thus, the one-year time limit did not apply. The court also held that under Wash. Crim. R. 7.8(b)(5), relief was justified for an extraordinary circumstance. Also, defendant's motion was filed within a reasonable time.</SPAN></P>

The court held that Wash. Rev.

He was confined to an institution. He challenged the trial court's use of his prior convictions to support its determination. He contended they were invalid for use because he pleaded guilty without knowing the state would later use them to support confinement. He also contended that the conditions of his confinement under &sect; 71.09 violated his constitutional rights. The court denied his petition and held that the state properly relied upon his prior guilty pleas to support his status as a sexual predator. He need not be advised at the time of his plea of the possibility of a habitual criminal proceeding as the possible confinement was a collateral consequence of his plea, not a definite, immediate, or automatic result.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A conviction, although later reversed, was conclusive evidence of probable cause, unless that conviction was obtained by fraud, perjury or other corrupt means, or, unless the ground for reversal was absence of probable cause. Because probable cause was a complete defense to claims for malicious prosecution, as well as false arrest and imprisonment, those claims were barred unless the plaintiff could establish the conviction was obtained by fraud, perjury, or other corrupt means. While the complaint did not specifically allege fraud, perjury or other corrupt means, the court found the complaint identified factual scenarios that could establish those facts. The court held that the defendants had not established an insuperable bar to relief, and that the malicious prosecution, false arrest, false imprisonment, civil rights, outrage, and defamation claims should not have been dismissed. The plaintiff's negligent investigation claim should have been dismissed because the claim was not cognizable in Washington.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the Superior Court, Chelan County (Washington), which convicted him of two counts of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver. He alleged that the dual conviction subjected him to double jeopardy, that the trial court erred in refusing to appoint new counsel before trial, and that there was insufficient evidence of intent to deliver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal of defendant's convictions, the court held that, to constitute the &quot;same offense&quot; under the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, the multiple acts were required to be the same both in law and in fact. The court found that defendant's convictions were for the same offense at law, as they were based on the same statute. The court found that, factually, defendant's possession was a single offense as he possessed cocaine in a continuous, uninterrupted series of events that was the focus of the prosecution against him. In effect, his possession of the cocaine from the undercover agent merged with his possession of the 14 bindles he brought with him. The court held that the trial court erred in failing to make a detailed investigation of defendant's request for new counsel and of his reasons for his disatisfaction. Nonetheless, this error was harmless, as defendant's counsel's performance did not actually violate his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. The large amount of cash after the transaction, coupled with the large amount of cocaine, was sufficient to prove defendant's intent to deliver.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Having found that the dual convictions violated defendant's right against double jeopardy, the court reversed one of the convictions. The court affirmed the remaining, merged conviction and remanded the conviction for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the father received notice of the State's termination proceedings, that the State chose the expedited process under &sect; 13.34.190(2), (3) because the father's murder of the children's mother was an aggravating circumstance, that the father stipulated to the expedited process of &sect; 13.34.190(2), (3), and that the process did not prevent the father from receiving necessary parenting services under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.180(4). The court also held that the father refused to acknowledge responsibility for his actions, that the father had a criminal history of violence, that the expedited proceedings did not deprive the father of his due process rights, and that the trial court's finding that the father's parental deficiencies would not be remedied in the near future was supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court's ruling that the board's actions were lawful was proper, because Wash. Rev.

The trial court dismissed appellant's complaint but ordered respondent to pay the disputed fee into the court pending an investigation. On appeal, the court reversed the portion of the trial court's order dismissing appellant's claim and remanded. The court also reversed for lack of jurisdiction that portion of the trial court's order compelling respondent to pay the fee into the registry of the trial court. The court held that: 1) the allegations in appellant's complaint stated a claim upon which relief could be granted as the prohibition on referral fees applied only to lawyers; and 2) the trial court did not have jurisdiction over respondent for conduct relating to the case in which the fee was earned because the issue of attorney discipline was not within the issues raised by appellant's complaint.</SPAN></P>

The record was unclear whether the volunteer chaplains limited themselves to determining the spiritual needs of people in crisis and to offering religious guidance only when the person expressed a need. The court also found that it could not tell whether public funds were applied to the support of a religious establishment because the organization was described as a Christian ministry.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of felony or aggravated assault as to the first person, and felony murder as to the second person; the aggravated assault being the required underlying felony to support the felony murder charge. On review, the court held that charging multiple offenses or imposing multiple sentences arising from the same actions did not violate double jeopardy because double jeopardy did not preclude prosecution for different crimes. The court held that aggravated assault was not a lesser included offense of felony murder because each required proof of different elements. In addition, separate victims meant separate crimes. For the same reason the trial court was correct to deny giving a lesser included jury instruction. That was especially true as defendant claimed he acted in self-defense, which completely barred any claim of being guilty of a lesser included offense. The court held that because there were different crimes against different victims, the two crimes did not &quot;merge,&quot; separate penalties could be imposed, and no jury instruction on merger was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the Omnibus Alcohol and Controlled Substances Act (Act), which provided for 24-month sentence enhancements for drug offenses within 1,000 feet of school grounds, violated the state constitution's single subject rule because the legislature included appropriations within the Act. The court held that the appropriations effectuated the legislative purpose of the Act. Thus, there was rational unity between the appropriations and the Act and no violation of the single subject rule. The court stated that the single subject rule in Wash. Const. art. 2, &sect; 19 provided that no bill shall embrace more than one subject and that shall have been expressed in the title. The court concluded that each provision of the Act, including enhanced penalties for drug offenses committed within 1000 feet of a school, furthered the legislative purpose of counteracting substance abuse problems. While the Act defined rights and appropriated money, it did not run afoul of the &quot;logrolling&quot; prohibition because the Act was not an appropriations bill. The court held that defendant had not sustained his burden and the Act did not violate the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

The partnership appealed the notice, which was denied. By writ of certiorari, the partnership appealed to the trial court, which dismissed the writ. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the county did not seek to regulate the manufacture and construction of the mini-warehouses, but rather required a permit for the placement of the warehouses.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 70.76A.140(1) (amend. 1993), a county-designated chemical dependency specialist (CDCDS) prepared, signed, and filed a petition with the superior court for an order involuntary committing appellant for alcoholism treatment. After the petition was granted, appellant sought review, claiming &sect; 70.76A.140(1) violated Wash. Const. art. 4, &sect; 1 by invading the judicial branch's exclusive purview to regulate the practice of law. In affirming, the court rejected appellant's contention that the legislature had violated the separation of powers doctrine by statutorily authorizing non-attorneys to practice law. In rejecting this contention, the court noted that the judiciary's inherent powers included both the power to enjoin the practice of law, notwithstanding purported legislative authorization, as well as the power to allow it, irrespective of what the statutory language suggested. The court concluded that the judiciary's constitutional role in regulating the practice of law had not been violated by the legislature's limited authorization of a CDCDS to sign a petition for an order of commitment, as provided by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 70.76A.140(1) (amend. 1993).</SPAN></P>

The landowner's claimed that the amendments to the city's zoning code that created three zones were facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city rezoned land in the downtown area to provide three zoning districts. The landowners' land was primarily used for manufacturing, but was located in the commercial enterprise zone. Although the landowners' businesses could continue to operate as legal nonconforming uses, they claimed that the rezoning had a detrimental impact on their business and that of their tenants. The trial court found their action was time barred and the court affirmed, holding that a 30-day limitation period applied and the landowners did not commence the action until 73 days after the ordinances were enacted. It found that the three-year period for claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 did not apply, as the pleadings below did not reflect that they sought such relief. Instead, the landowners only relied on the &sect; 1983 limitation period in their opposition to the city's motion to dismiss. The court then used the reasonable-time-by analogy analysis to determine that a 30-day limitation period applied. It found that no other appeal period prescribed by state statute or local ordinance governed the type of land use action involved and that the limitation period for analogous land use decisions was 30 days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that a 30-day statute of limitations governed the landowner's land use challenge. Accordingly, it affirmed the trial court's decision, which found that the landowner's suit was time-barred and granted summary judgment to the city.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 69.53.010(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a violation of the &quot;building available&quot; statute and with manufacturing marijuana, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(a)(1)(ii). A jury acquitted defendant on the manufacturing charge and could not reach a verdict on the &quot;building available&quot; charge. Accordingly, the trial court ordered a new trial on the latter charge. A jury found defendant guilty on retrial, but the trial court granted a new trial on the ground that the double jeopardy provisions of the Fifth Amendment were violated by the admission of evidence that was introduced at the first trial that tended to show that defendant was involved in or had knowledge of the marijuana growing operation. On appeal, the court held that defendant's double jeopardy rights were not violated because the two charges were not the same offense because they did not satisfy Washington's version of the Blockburger &quot;same elements&quot; test. The court rejected defendant's contention on appeal that the trial court's ruling was actually based on collateral estoppel principles because the court refused to consider an oral ruling by the trial court that was not formally incorporated into the order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order, reinstated the guilty verdict, and remanded the case for sentencing.</SPAN></P>

He stopped defendant for excessive noise and for the equipment violation. Upon being stopped, defendant told the officer he was carrying a knife. Based on defendant's appearance and behavior, the officer suspected he was under the influence of drugs. During a pat-down search, he found a substance later identified as cocaine. He arrested defendant for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of drugs and for possession of cocaine.

The employee appealed, and the court affirmed. Although &sect; 51.32.160 allowed the employee to claim additional benefits, all other claims for benefits were time-barred. The employee's constitutional challenge failed because &sect; 51.32.160 was fair on its face, and he did not show either unequal treatment or intentional discrimination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile, who was under 15 years of age when he committed the offense, had pleaded guilty to one count of first degree child molestation. The juvenile court denied the juvenile's motion to waive sex offender registration on the basis of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.140. The juvenile argued that the registration was punitive and inconsistent with the intent of the sex offender statutes, that the State had failed to comply with the notice requirements of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.01.200, and that the registration violated his constitutional right to liberty, travel, and privacy, and inflicted punishment greatly disproportionate to the offense. The court found that the sex offender statute was ambiguous, and adopted a construction that sustained the statute's constitutionality. The court held that a juvenile who committed a sex offense while under age 15 had two remedies: The juvenile could petition for discharge from the registration requirement in the same manner and subject to the same burden of proof as a juvenile who committed a sex offense while age 15 or over, or the juvenile could utilize the less strict burden of proof after waiting 2 years.</SPAN></P>

The court found that strip searches were not searches permitted under the exigent circumstances or search incident to arrest exceptions. The court ruled that based on the fact that defendant was arrested for possession of cocaine and was observed removing objects from inside his pants, the officers had reasonable suspicion to perform a strip search and furthermore, the need to prevent the introduction of contraband into the jail outweighed defendant's privacy interests.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accountant accepted a loan from an elderly client for a company that was on the verge of bankruptcy and loaned that money to a formerly bankrupt friend to help the friend's business of raising rabbits. The board found that the accountant was negligent and violated the rules of conduct governing CPAs. The board also ordered the accountant to reimburse his client for the loan, although the bankruptcy court had discharged that debt. The court held that the board exceeded its authority in imposing restitution as a condition of reinstatement because the bankruptcy code prohibited the state from exacting a discharged debt as the price of receiving or retaining a license. The court also held that the revocation of the accountant's license was not taken without due consideration. The court reasoned that the violated rules were not unconstitutionally vague simply because they did not list every possible prohibited behavior. The accountant also violated the fiduciary duty of loyalty conferred upon him by his client's power of attorney. Substantial evidence supported the board's decision, and the remaining sanctions it imposed were neither excessive nor arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged injured parties filed a class action against the city and asserted federal civil rights violations, as well as state tort claims.

The alleged injured parties claimed that the dog handlers and the dogs used excessive or deadly force. The city contended that it was immune from the alleged injured parties' &sect; 1983 claims under federal law. On appeal, the court granted the alleged injured parties' motion to dismiss the city's appeal from the denial of its motion for summary judgment as to the &sect; 1983 claims. The court held that the city did not have a right to appeal under Wash. R. App. P. 2.2(a). The court further held that the supremacy clause was not violated because the state's discretionary review procedure under Wash. R. App. P. 2.3(b) provided an adequate and nondiscriminatory opportunity for immediate review of an adverse pretrial ruling. However, the court denied discretionary review because the trial court did not commit obvious or probable error in denying the city's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the filing of DWI charges in Superior Court, instead of in the District Court, deprived him of equal protection because deferred prosecution was available in District Court, but was unavailable in Superior Court. When police stopped defendant, he tried to elude a police car. After he was stopped, blood-alcohol tests revealed he was drunk. In plea negotiations, the prosecutor offered not to file the DWI charge if defendant pleaded guilty to the felony of attempting to elude a police car. Negotiations failed and the State moved to amend its information to include the DWI charge. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in granting the motion. Defendant was found guilty of DWI, but not guilty of the felony charge. The court rejected defendant's contention that he was denied equal protection because he submitted no evidence that others charged with DWI and a related felony were prosecuted for the DWI in District Court. The court held that there was a rational basis for filing the DWI charges in Superior Court. The court also held that the offer to withhold filing the DWI charge in return for a guilty plea on the felony was permissible negotiation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the petition on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction to modify the obligation order because the child had turned 18 before the petition was filed. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's ruling was correct because the trial court's authority to modify the decree did not continue beyond the child's 18th birthday where there was language in the decree that terminated the support obligation at the child's 18th birthday. That position was supported by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.170(3) which provided that child support obligations terminated when a child reached the age of majority.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment, which committed defendant to the SCC until it was safe for him to be at large. He appealed from that judgment. He also filed three personal restraint petitions. The court affirmed defendant's adjudication as a sexually violent predator. The matter was remanded for consideration of less restrictive alternatives to total confinement. Section 71.09.030 was not void for vagueness as long as less restrictive alternatives were considered. Moreover, the failure to provide a hearing on the ex parte petition did not require reversal because it did not affect the outcome of the trial. The court found that expert testimony was properly admitted and that no prejudice resulted from the alleged prosecutorial misconduct.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that a per se violation of the taking clause occurred when the regulation constituted either a total taking or a physical invasion of the property or destroys a fundamental attribute of ownership.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers purchased cocaine from defendant, and the officers discovered a large amount of cash and a baggie of cocaine in defendant's possession. Defendant argued that the trial court violated his right to a public trial by closing the courtroom during the pre-trial testimony of an undercover officer, that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss, and that the trial court erred in admitting his statements to the police. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court found that under a balancing test, the State's legitimate and compelling interest in protecting the undercover officer's identity outweighed defendant's interest in allowing spectators to be present. The court also found that the continuance, which delayed the trial, was granted for defendant's benefit because his original counsel was injured and defendant needed time to secure new counsel. Having executed one speedy trial waiver, defendant was clearly aware of his rights and failed to reassert his speedy trial right under Rule 3.3(f).

Thereafter, the trial court granted defendant's motion to exclude any reference to the sister. However, at defendant's trial, a testifying prosecutor referred to the sister. The court denied defendant's motion for a mistrial and gave a curative instruction. Defendant was convicted of one count of rape of a child in the first degree under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.073. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant's statements to a &quot;family minister&quot; were not privileged communications because non-ordained church counselors were not &quot;clergy&quot; for the purposes of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 5.60.060(3). Further, although the trial court's refusal to allow cross-examination of the victim's father about a possible civil action was error, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the excluded evidence did not affect the weight of the essential testimony. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion for a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the motion to suppress was properly denied, finding that: (1) the observations of the first officer established probable cause that defendant committed a crime, and, under the fellow officer rule, the arresting officers had probable cause to arrest; (2) the search was justified under the Fourth Amendment requirement of reasonableness where the police had probable cause to believe defendant had committed a crime, that the suspect was in the stall, and that it was therefore reasonable to search the stall; (3) the evidence was also admissible under the inevitable discovery rule; and (4) the requirement of no contact with drug zones was proper under Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant made 680 &quot;hang up&quot; phone calls to a crisis center over a four-day period and was convicted of telephone harassment under Seattle, Wash., Municipal Code 12A.06.100. Another defendant called his girlfriend up to 15 times a day over a period of months and was convicted of telephone harassment under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.61.230. The superior court affirmed defendants' convictions. On consolidated appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that telephone harassment laws distinguished between harassing calls and other communication. Thus, the term &quot;embarrass,&quot; as included in the harassment laws, was not unconstitutionally overbroad in light of the privacy concerns invoked by non-public telephone communications and the laws' emphasis on conduct instead of speech. Further, the terms &quot;anonymously&quot; and &quot;repeatedly&quot; as used in the telephone harassment laws provided adequate notice to persons of common intelligence as to what behavior was prohibited and as to the specific intent required. The laws also provided sufficient guidelines to prevent arbitrary enforcement. Thus, Seattle, Wash., Municipal Code 12A.06.100 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.61.230 were not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which convicted him of weapons possession pursuant to Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two police officers motioned a car with a mangled license plate to the side of the street, saw a man sitting in the passenger seat and leaning as if to place something under the seat, and asked the man to exit the car. One officer opened the car door and saw the butt of a revolver. The man was convicted of violating Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040, which prohibited possession of a firearm by a juvenile who had been convicted of a felony violation of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act. Defendant challenged the seizure and argued that his motion to suppress the fruits of the search should have been sustained. The court noted that brief detention during a Terry stop might constitute a seizure but did not amount to an arrest. The officers were entitled to ask defendant to exit the car. The search for weapons was justified by defendant's suspicious movements, which presented possible danger to the officers. Nor was defendant's ex post facto argument tenable: the statute created an entirely new offense, not an enhancement of an old one. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The county required the applicant to dedicate a stub road access to a landlocked neighboring property as a condition for approval of the application. The applicant argued that the condition amounted to a taking of property without compensation. The court agreed with the applicant. The neighboring property had always been isolated from the county roads, thus its need for access was not a result of the proposed subdivision. Since the dedication requirement would not remedy any problem caused by the applicant's proposed subdivision, requiring the applicant to dedicate property for a stub road extension amounted to an unconstitutional taking. The court specifically held that the county could not condition approval of the subdivision on the dedication of property unless a need for the dedication arose from the development under review.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dancers were arrested during a raid for violating Tukwila, Wash., Municipal Code ch. 5.56.070.

The dancers brought a conspiracy action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1985, 1986, 1988, for damages and attorney fees against the city and the police sergeant. Before trial, the dancers stipulated that probable cause exited for their arrests. The trial court denied the dancers' summary judgment motion and granted the summary judgment motion of the city and the sergeant. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court because the dancers' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1985(3) claim failed to identify the protected class of which they were members. Further, the dancers' Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.31.100 claim did not survive because it was not based on a federal constitutional violation. Moreover, Wash. Ct. Ltd. Juris. Crim. R. 2.1(b)(2) exceeded federal protection and could not serve as the basis for a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim. Finally, because full custodial arrest was an option and no dancer was held more than 48 hours before a probable cause hearing, there was no violation of federal law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant entered a plea of guilty and was convicted of four counts of incest. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the information was not deficient for failure to allege that the stepdaughter was under the age of 18 at the time of the offenses. The court determined that while the age of the stepdaughter was capable of providing a complete defense to a charge of incest as it related to a stepchild, the age was not a necessary statutory element required to have been set forth in the indictment. The court further held that the use of the word &quot;stepdaughter&quot; in place of &quot;descendent&quot; was a proper one because the definition of descendent under Wash. Rev.

The juvenile challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 9.41.250 as being vague as applied to her where she only carried a three inch paring knife. The court reversed and dismissed the charges against her. The court held that &sect; 9.41.250 could be construed as requiring evidence of identifiable conduct by the defendant that proved beyond a reasonable doubt that she intended to conceal a dangerous weapon. Merely carrying an item did not usually involve identifiable conduct. It was not an overt movement. The court reasoned that the drafters of &sect; 9.41.250 must have had in mind a movement to conceal a weapon, done furtively, in a way meant to escape notice. Otherwise, the court concluded, there were all too many easily imagined instances of innocent conduct involving the carrying of pocket knives, kitchen knives, letter openers, pepper sprays, scissors, common tools, and other dangerous objects with intent to conceal them in, for example, a pocket, handbag, shopping bag, or boot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of Snohomish County (Washington), which convicted defendant of one count each of possession of cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to deliver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the traffic stop that resulted in his arrest on outstanding warrants and the discovery of the cocaine that was the basis of the possession charge was pretextual. The court found that the trial court did not err in refusing to suppress the evidence obtained from the traffic stop because the traffic stop for a license plate violation was not pretextual. Although the police officer was suspicious of the vehicle in which defendant was riding when he saw it emerge from behind an abandoned gas station, the license infraction gave him authority, independent of his suspicions, to stop the vehicle. Furthermore, upon observing that defendant was not wearing his seatbelt, the officer then had authority to request defendants identification. Finally, the stop was not pretextual because under the same circumstances a reasonable officer would have made the stop. The court also found, with respect to the intent to distribute charge, that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury that defendant had to prove entrapment by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Washington Independent Telephone Association (Commission), sought review of a judgment of the Thurston County Superior Court (Washington) in a declaratory judgment action filed by appellee, an association of telecommunications consumers, which invalidated Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 480-120-425, a rule the Commission promulgated that created a fund that was to be funded by assessment of charges on certain telecommunication services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission adopted as part of rules that governed expanded local toll-free area telephone services a community calling fund that was to be funded by a charge levied on local exchange carriers (LEC) based on the number of exchange access lines each carrier controlled within the state. Under a formula in the rule, smaller LECs that experienced revenue shortfalls were eligible for support from the fund. The Commission filed a petition for declaratory judgment that sought a declaration that the rule was constitutional and within its authority. Appellee, an association of LECs, and the largest LEC were permitted by stipulation to intervene as parties. The association filed a cross-petition that sought a declaration that the rule was invalid because the fund exceeded the Commission's authority. The superior court found that the rule was invalid because the Commission had no statutory authority for its enactment. The court held that the state's public service laws did not authorize the imposition of a charge on all access lines as a funding mechanism for the fund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court, Pierce County (Washington) entering summary judgment in favor of respondent, Department of Labor and Industries of the State of Washington (department), in the claimant's action challenging the department's denial of his request to reopen his claim for worker's compensation benefits under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.32.160.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant injured his elbow in the course of his employment. The department accepted a claim for worker's compensation benefits. The department reopened the claim several times because the claimant alleged that his condition was aggravated. When the claimant applied to reopen his claim another time, the department denied his request because the application was not timely filed within the limitations period in &sect; 51.32.160. The claimant appealed to an administrative board, but the board upheld the decision. The claimant filed an action against the department seeking judicial review. The trial court granted summary judgment for the department, finding that &sect; 51.32.160 was constitutional. The claimant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 51.32.160 did not violate the claimant's equal protection rights. The court reasoned that there was a rational basis for determining whether claimants were subject to the limitations period in &sect; 51.32.160 based on whether they had a medical evaluation for their injury. The classification was rationally related to the interest in finalizing claims. The court also held that &sect; 51.32.160 did not violate due process guarantees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision entering summary judgment for the department in the claimant's action challenging the department's denial of his request to reopen his claim for worker's compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>
