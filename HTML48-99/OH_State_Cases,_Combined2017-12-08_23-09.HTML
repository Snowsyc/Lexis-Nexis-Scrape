</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of gross sexual imposition and sentenced thereon in 1996. Ohio Rev.

The statute provided for retroactive application. The trial court made a factual finding that defendant was a sexual predator. However, in its decision filed that same day, the trial court found the community notification provision contained in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.09(C)(2) violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, and the trial court declined to attach the classification to defendant's sentence. Plaintiff prosecution appealed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder and his conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. He then sought postconviction relief and raised twenty-five points of error. Many of those points had already been raised on direct appeal, including an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim. The trial court dismissed appellant's petition for postconviction relief and he sought review. He also expanded an issue that was raised in direct appeal and argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney had not been certified to handle death penalty cases. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the petition for postconviction relief and found that the errors that had been raised on direct appeal were barred from further review by res judicata. The court also found that the issues that could have been raised on direct appeal and which were not raised were barred from consideration. The court further found that lack of certification for death penalty cases did not require a finding that appellant had received ineffective assistance of counsel and that certification was only a factor to be considered in an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant molested 21 boys over a two-year period while he was a cub scout troop leader, pleading guilty to eight counts of rape and one count of attempted rape. He was adjudicated by the trial court to be a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(C)(2). The reviewing court first summarily rejected his contentions that the sexual predator statute was unconstitutional on grounds of ex post facto, retroactivity, double jeopardy, denial of due process and equal protection, void for vagueness, and violation of his right to privacy, all pursuant to precedent. The court then affirmed his adjudication, holding the evidence sufficient under a clear and convincing standard to support his adjudication where he performed various sex acts on his victims, performed such acts on other children in the victims' presence, undressed in front of his victims, showed his victims pornographic materials, photographed some of his victims naked, and threatened his victims to keep them from telling their parents or others what he had done.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that a manifest miscarriage of justice did not occur as a result of the adjudication because it was based upon clear and convincing evidence that appellant was a sexual predator.

The indictment stemmed from allegations that appellant had engaged in non-consensual sexual conduct with three children. Appellant was found guilty on nine of the eleven charges and was sentenced to consecutive sentences of ten to 25 years on each count. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The case was referred back to the trial court to determine appellant's status as a sexual predator, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss and a motion for a psychological examination, and they were denied. The court determined appellant should be classified as a sexual predator and appeal followed. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, finding appellant's constitutional challenges to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 were without merit.

The charges had been adjudicated by the prison's rules infractions board and upheld by the adult parole board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, who had been sentenced to a definite term of 16 months in the state penitentiary, sought immediate release through a habeas corpus action. While incarcerated he had been, on two occasions, charged with assault under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.13. In each instance, the facility's rules infraction board had found petitioner guilty of the charge and recommended that he be required to serve additional &quot;bad time&quot; once his original term of incarceration had terminated. The Adult Parole Board upheld the recommendations. The court issued the writ of habeas corpus because the procedure in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.11 allowed prison officials and the parole board to perform a judicial function, which could not be performed by a non-judicial entity. The court concluded that &sect; 2967.11 was unconstitutional because it violated the doctrine of the separation of powers in that it allowed a non-judicial agency to perform the judicial function of trying an individual for a criminal offense and imposing sentence; and furthermore, the statute allowed a prisoner to be convicted of a crime without the benefit of essential due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted a writ of habeas corpus on petitioner's showing that he was serving time in the state penitentiary beyond his specified sentence because prison officials and not a court imposed the additional time. This violated the separation of powers doctrine, and deprived petitioner of his liberty without benefit of his due process rights under both state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent had been killed in an automobile accident, caused by another driver's negligence. Driver's insurer offered to settle decedent's claim, and appellee, decedent's insurer, therefore denied underinsured motorist coverage because the settlement amount equaled the policy's &quot;per person&quot; limit. Appellant administrator of decedent's estate sued appellee, seeking a declaratory judgment that the estate was entitled to collect up to the policy's &quot;per accident&quot; amount, and that appellee was liable for the difference between that amount and the settlement offer. Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment, as well as a motion for sanctions. Appellant alleged that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18(H), which allowed insurance companies to limit liability when any one person was injured or killed in any one accident, was unconstitutional. The trial court granted appellee's summary judgment motion and awarded sanctions; and appellant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the statute was not unconstitutional, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding sanctions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Highland County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) denying his motion for resentencing. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred by refusing to resentence him under the sentencing structure of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 1.58 and Am. Sub. S.B. 269 (Ohio 1995). Alternatively, he claimed that the statutes deprived him of his U.S. Const. amend. VIII and XIV rights and violated the prohibition on ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In March 1995, defendant was convicted of theft and arson and sentenced accordingly. In 1997, defendant filed a motion requesting the trial court to resentence him claiming that S.B. 2 (Ohio 1995) and Am. Sub. S.B. 269 (Ohio 1995) (Senate Bill 2) altered the terms of imprisonment for theft and arson convictions. The trial court denied the motion and defendant appealed claiming that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58 and Senate Bill 2 required the court to reduce his sentence; that the trial court's refusal to resentence him under Senate Bill 2 violated his U.S. Const. and Ohio Const. art. II rights; and, alternatively, that Senate Bill 2 violated the ex post facto law prohibition. The court affirmed first explaining that the trial court did not err in refusing to reduce defendant's sentence because Senate Bill 2 did not alter sentences imposed for crimes committed before July 1, 1996. Further, Ohio precedent established that Senate Bill 2 did not violate defendant's U.S. Const. amend VIII and XIV rights. Finally, Senate Bill 2 was not an ex post facto law because it provided that the punishments for crimes committed prior to its effective date were not altered by its enactment.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2117.06.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A decedent was indebted to defendant creditor at the time of her death for services rendered. Defendant referred the decedent's account to its collection company, which sent plaintiff administrator, before his appointment, a proof of claim letter.

After plaintiff was appointed administrator, he commenced a lawsuit against 19 of the decedent's creditors requesting that the trial court to declare defendants' claims forever barred on the basis that they failed to present their claims to him within one year of the decedent's death as was required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2117.06. The case was transferred to the probate court, which granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and defendant appealed. The court held that section 2117.06 was not constitutionally vague because it did not cause one of ordinary intelligence to guess as to its meaning; that the doctrine of relation back did not apply because defendant failed to verify whether plaintiff had been appointed within the one-year period; and that defendant failed to establish the defense of equitable estoppel.</SPAN></P>

The appellant challenged the court's designation on the basis that the stipulated facts did not provide clear and convincing evidence in support of the finding and that retroactive application of the statute was unconstitutional. The court found that, although the trial court did not specifically use the language &quot;clear and convincing&quot; in its opinion, the evidence supported the trial court's findings.

On appeal, the court upheld the order and found that &sect; 2950.09 did not violate U.S. Const. art. 1 &sect; 10 or Ohio Const. art. 2 &sect; 28 because it was not an ex post facto law or retroactive legislation. The court further found that the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant was likely to engage in future sexually oriented offenses. It said that a pre-sentence report showed a long pattern of abuse. Therefore, the court held that defendant's equal protection rights were not violated. The court also held that the clear and convincing standard used by the trial court sufficiently protected defendant's rights and was not vague. The court similarly rejected defendant's arguments that the statute constituted a bill of attainder, constituted double jeopardy, or constituted cruel and unusual punishment.

Following his plea, defendant was sentenced and incarcerated. Upon the completion of his prison term, the trial court ordered a hearing to determine whether defendant was a sexual predator. After a two-day hearing, the court adjudicated defendant to be a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 et seq. Defendant appealed arguing that the statute as applied to him was ex post facto legislation and, therefore, unconstitutional, and that the trial court improperly applied Ohio R. Evid. 101(C)(3).

The court held the trial court had discretion to determine the most effective way to protect the public from future crime and to punish defendant. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2929.14(C), the trial court was allowed to impose a maximum sentence on defendant because its finding that he committed one of the worst forms of the offense and was likely to commit future crimes was supported by the record. Defendant's sentence was thus affirmed. The court also concluded that the trial court properly adjudicated defendant a sexual predator based on several factors listed in Ohio Rev.

The court affirmed defendant's sentence based on its determination that Ohio Rev. Code &sect;1.58(B) was not modified by a senate bill. Defendant was thus properly sentenced under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 1.58(B). The court held the sexual offender registration statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950, was neither retroactive nor an ex-post facto law. The statute contained de minimis procedural requirements and was remedial. The community notification provisions did not impinge on any substantive right. Because the statute was not punitive, it did not impose cruel and unusual punishment and did not violate double jeopardy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was ordered to register as a sexual predator under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.04. Defendant had been sentenced to prison for sexual battery. The correctional institution recommended defendant be adjudicated as a sexual predator. Defendant filed a request for discovery, a motion for an order finding the statute unconstitutionally vague, a motion to continue the hearing until all motions were heard, and a motion for an order finding the statute inapplicable as an ex post facto law. The trial court never explicitly ruled on the motions and the matter proceeded to hearing. At the hearing, the court found defendant was convicted of a sexually oriented offense and subject to the registration requirements of the statute. Defendant appealed arguing the trial court had a duty to rule on the motion to dismiss on the issue of vagueness and the court incorrectly ruled on violations of ex post facto laws. The reviewing court stated that when a trial court failed to rule upon a motion, it was presumed the trial court overruled such motion. Regarding defendant's other contentions, the court relied on case law and overruled the issues. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that the trial court erred in finding that a Senate bill was constitutional, as it allegedly violated the right to remedy, separation of powers, special privileges and immunities and equal protection provisions of the state constitution. The court affirmed. The clear language of Ohio Rev.

The court agreed with the trial court that by applying the setoff rule to the facts of the case, the sum available for payment from the tortfeasor's policy would have been setoff from appellant's underinsured policy limit, leaving no available underinsured coverage. It was undisputed that under amendments to &sect; 3937.18(A)(2), appellant had no underinsured motorist claim.</SPAN></P>

Appellee filed a damage claim based on negligence and strict liability. Despite finding that appellant was not negligent, the trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment, finding appellant strictly liable for her son's actions under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3109.10. Appellant sought review, arguing that her due process and equal protection rights were violated by the imposition of strict liability for her child's behavior when her child was with the non-custodial parent. The court held the statute did not violate either appellant's equal protection or due process rights. The statute did not deprive appellant of liberty or property interests without due process of law and was reasonably related to legitimate state interests in making parents more responsible and compensating victims. The statute was not unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious, and did not represent an unconstitutional intrusion into family integrity. The order granting summary judgment for appellee was thus affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The delay in ruling on the admissibility of other acts evidence did not prejudice defendant. The admission was proper because defendant was previously convicted of a very similar act with another young child. While the prosecution did not name an other acts witness, the witness was allowed to testify because the prosecution previously stated that it planned to elicit the witness's testimony. Defendant was not entitled to a judgment of acquittal because whether defendant's sexual touching was for sexual arousal was a jury question. Ohio Rev.

Defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.321(A)(5) was unconstitutional as applied in his case. Because he failed to raise the issue at trial, the issue was waived. The court did not commit prejudicial error in refusing to grant the defense a reasonable continuance to prepare to rebut the prosecution's evidence. The motion for continuance was not requested until the morning of the jury trial, and defense counsel was completely responsible for the circumstances that gave rise to the last-minute motion. Defense counsel's motion in limine to prevent the jury from considering the videotape at issue did not preserve the issue for appeal; the defense was required to raise a proper objection at trial to preserve the error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to possession of crack cocaine after the trial court overruled his motion to suppress evidence of crack cocaine found on his person. The appellate court affirmed the judgment, holding that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress. Based on the evidence, the court held that the officers who stopped defendant's vehicle had probable cause to stop him and that the ensuing searches were constitutionally appropriate. The information the officers received from an informant was accurate, and the officers observed conduct consistent with the informant's claim that defendant was distributing drugs from the vehicle. The officers had probable cause to suspect that defendant had just engaged in unlawful drug transactions, thus justifying his arrest. The strip search at the police station was a search pursuant to a lawful arrest and, therefore, the evidence of the cocaine was not subject to exclusion. Additionally, the court held that the sentence was not disproportionate to the severity of the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a sexually oriented offense; subsequently, the court held a sexual predator determination hearing pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950, and found defendant to be a sexual predator. The registration and notification provision of the statute did not violate U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, or Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950, because its provision served the remedial purpose of protecting the public. The record indicated that appellant's prior convictions did not include sexually oriented offenses. His single victim was an adult, the underlying sexual offense took place more than 10 years before he was designated a sexual predator, there was no evidence to indicate he used drugs or alcohol to impair his victim, there was no demonstration of a pattern of abuse, and there was no evidence presented to show behavioral characteristics contributing to his conduct or to indicate a mental illness or disability. Thus, there was not clear and convincing evidence to support defendant's adjudication as a sexual predator. Defendant was denied his right to cross examine and present expert testimony as provided by Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950. The matter was remanded for further consideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09 could be applied retrospectively to defendant without violation of the Ex Post Facto clause because the registration and notification provisions of the statute served the remedial purpose of protecting the public and did not affect defendant's substantive rights. Defendant's other constitutional arguments had been addressed and found wanting in a recently decided case overruling identical assignments of error and the conclusions of that court were adopted. The decision of the lower court was affirmed because the record demonstrated that the lower court had considered the applicable statutory factors, defendant's prior conviction for rape, his plea of guilty to sexual battery, and the likelihood of recidivism in finding defendant was a sexual predator. Such old conviction data, as well as the commission of the crime of sexual battery while on parole, was legally sufficient to support an adjudication of sexual predator status clearly and convincingly.</SPAN></P>

The trial court then determined that defendant was a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950. Based on prior Ohio Supreme Court precedent, the court concluded that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2950.09(2) (1), 2950.09(B) (1) did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, or U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 did not violate defendant's right to due process or equal protection as guaranteed under the United States and Ohio constitutions. The statute was not void for vagueness, was not an unconstitutional bill of attainder, did not constitute double jeopardy, did not violate defendant's right to privacy, did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, and did not violate Ohio R.

The appellate court affirmed the trial court decision. Sufficient evidence established that appellant's action was offensive and caused his victim annoyance and alarm within the meaning of &sect; 509.03, while having no lawful purpose. The conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The trial court did not err by denying appellant's mistrial motions because appellant received sufficient pretrial discovery. The state did not have possession, custody, or control of material documents and items subject to disclosure. Appellant was not the victim of selective prosecution because appellant failed to show that his prosecution was purposeful discrimination. Additionally, &sect; 509.03 was not unconstitutionally vague because a reasonable person would have understood that spitting in another's face would violate the ordinance. The trial court did not improperly admit a police officer's testimony because it was not hearsay, because it was not introduced to prove the truth of the asserted matter.</SPAN></P>

At a sexual predator hearing the trial court rejected appellant's arguments that the sexual predator statute was unconstitutional and found he should be classified as a sexual predator. Appellant challenged the order. On appeal, the court stated that it had previously held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(C) did not violate the Retroactivity Clause of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 or the Ex Post Facto Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Further, sexual predator laws do not violate privacy, double jeopardy, equal protection, or cruel and unusual punishment protections afforded by the Ohio Constitution and United States Constitution. In addition, because they are collateral consequences and not punishment, Ohio R. Crim. P. 11 does not require a trial court to inform defendant of the registration and notification requirements accompanying a designation as a sexual predator. Appellant's assignments of error were not well taken. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Relator instituted the action seeking to remove respondent from office pursuant to Ohio Rev.

Subsequently, respondent applied to have his record of conviction sealed pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.32(A)(1) and the application was granted. The court noted that pursuant to &sect; 2953.32, a first-time federal felon could apply for and receive an expungement of Ohio records pertaining to his federal conviction and be restored to all rights and privileges not otherwise restored by termination of sentence or probation. Therefore the court found that an order to seal criminal records pursuant to &sect; 2953.32 and .33 operated to remove the forfeiture of the right to hold office found at &sect; 2961.01.

The court ruled that the sexual predator hearing was insufficient for purposes of Ohio Rev.

Because at the sexual predator hearing the parties did not address the merits of the sexual predator classification issue, appellant was denied the benefit of counsel and a meaningful hearing on that issue, and thus remand was necessary. The sexual predator statutes did not violate the ex post facto or the double jeopardy clauses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction in the Madison County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) for burglary with a gun specification and receiving stolen property, arguing that the trial court erred in instructing that defendant could be found guilty as a principal offender or as an aider and abettor, that venue was improper, that the gun specification was error, and that defendant was denied the opportunity to prepare for a sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for burglary with a gun specification and receiving stolen property. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in charging the jury that defendant could have been found guilty as a principal offender or as an aider and abettor, but on review the court found that the facts showed that defendant participated in the planning, execution, and completion, and sufficiently brought defendant within the language of the complicity statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.03. The court rejected defendant's challenge to venue, finding that the matter could have been tried in any jurisdiction from which or into which the property was taken under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.12(C). The court found that firearms were included in the articles taken, that the gun specification was proper, and that the constitutional challenges were not raised with any degree of specificity at trial and were deemed waived where plain error was not shown and where the rights and interests involved did not warrant consideration. The court finally held that the trial court had no obligation to suspend sentencing where there was no probation.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 2950.01 after he had been convicted and sentenced for sexual battery and gross sexual imposition. The court found that section 2950 as applied to conduct prior to its effective date did not violate the retroactivity clause of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, or the ex post facto clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Because section 2950 was not punitive in nature, it did not violate double jeopardy principles. The court also found that section 2950 was not unconstitutionally vague. The conviction was supported by sufficient evidence to show that defendant was a sexual predator under section 2950 factors. The record showed that defendant had repeatedly sexually abused his victims over an extended period of time, all of whom were under the age of 12. Defendant exhibited a pattern of abuse, including forcible acts, and there was no evidence of his mental illness or impairment. Based on the evidence, the lower court's conclusion that defendant was likely to engage in sexually oriented offenses in the future was not against the clear and convincing weight of the evidence.

According to the appeals court, defendant was a sexual predator as defined under the statute because defendant was convicted of or pled guilty to committing a sexually oriented offense and was likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses. The appeals court found that the lower court properly considered defendant's age, the age of the victims, defendant's prior conviction for two counts of rape involving young girls, as well as defendant's statements that he had uncontrollable urges in determining whether defendant was a sexual predator.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant prisoner was sentenced following his convictions for sexual battery and gross sexual imposition. Several years later, following the enactment of Ohio's version of Megan's Law, Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2907.03(5) (&sect;2907), defendant was adjudicated a sexual predator. Defendant appealed on ex post facto and retroactivity grounds, double jeopardy grounds, due process grounds, that section 2907 was unconstitutionally vague, and evidence insufficiency. The court overruled defendant's first five points of error based on legal precedent. As to the evidence, the court found that the record contained relevant, competent, and credible evidence upon which the fact finder could have based its judgment. The court noted defendant had multiple victims, many of whom were children under the age of 13. Defendant's acts took place over a long course of time, indicative of his predator mentality. Defendant admitted that he had affiliated himself with a church and a community service organization to prey upon his victims. This behavior fell squarely within statutory factors enumerated in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.09(B). As it was not against the manifest weight of the evidence, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the sentence, which was the maximum sentence, imposed by the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) for his sexual predator conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to gross sexual imposition and received a one and one-half years prison sentence. Defendant was also found to be a sexual predator pursuant Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(2). On appeal defendant challenged the imposition of maximum sentence for gross sexual imposition, the constitutionality of the sexual predator law, and the evidence used to find him to be a sexual predator. The court rejected defendant's contention that a sexual predator determination must be made upon sworn testimony and cross-examination. The sexual predator determination hearing was to determine defendant's status, not his guilt or innocence; thus, the hearing was not intended to be the equivalent of a trial and the rules of evidence did not apply. The trial court properly referred to defendant's presentence report in determining that he was a sexual predator; therefore, the determination was upheld. The sexual predator law was remedial in nature; thus, it could not compromise a substantive element of the charged sex offense. Defendant was not entitled to notice in the indictment that he might be determined to be a sexual predator. Defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for gross sexual imposition was affirmed. However, the court found that defendant should not have received maximum sentence and, therefore, reversed and remanded in part. It was inconsistent for trial judge to impose the maximum sentence on the basis that defendant committed the worst form of the offense and then say that he would grant a motion for shock probation that would effectively grant defendant an early release.</SPAN></P>

A rational trier of fact could have found that appellant was operating his motor vehicle in violation of &sect; 4511.19(A)(1) because he had the potential to move the vehicle while he was under the influence of alcohol. The weight of the evidence supported the verdict. Section 4511.19(A)(1) was not unconstitutionally vague because the Ohio Supreme Court had defined &quot;operate&quot; as a broad term including the situation where an intoxicated person was in the driver's seat with the ignition keys.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter as a result of his truck crashing into the stopped truck in front of him, causing the death of its driver. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of a murder conviction arising out of the misdemeanor traffic violation. The court found no violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII because the sentence imposed fell within the range of punishments in the sentencing statute and did not shock the conscience of the community. The court also found no evidence that appellant had been prosecuted on the basis of any impermissible criterion in violation of his equal rights protections. Since offenses designed to protect public health and safety did not have to contain a mens rea element, there was no due process violation. The court had discretion to allow the jury to hear taped testimony again after jury deliberations had begun. Since there was sufficient evidence to convict, the verdict was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction as it found no constitutional violation in convicting appellant of involuntary manslaughter as a result of his misdemeanor negligent driving and there was sufficient evidence to convict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant arranged for a vehicle to be shipped from California to Ohio. While the vehicle was en route, state troopers in Indiana stopped the carrier. A search of the vehicle disclosed a concealed compartment containing large amounts of cocaine. Defendant was indicted on one count of aggravated trafficking in drugs. He pled not guilty and filed a motion to suppress evidence on the ground that the search had been unlawful. The trial court ruled that defendant had no legitimate expectation of privacy and thus lacked standing to challenge the search. On appeal, the judgment was affirmed. The court held that the lower court did not err in finding that defendant lacked standing to challenge the search. The court reasoned that he failed to explain his relationship with the registered owner of the vehicle. The court also held that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction because jurors could reasonably infer that defendant had knowledge of the narcotics, and that he had constructive possession of the drugs in Ohio.</SPAN></P>

The state then sought the court's review.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was convicted of rape and kidnapping. Approximately eight years later, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction recommended that the trial court schedule a hearing to determine whether appellee was a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The trial court dismissed the pending sexual predator proceeding against appellee, holding that the application of ch. 2950 to sex offenders who were convicted and sentenced prior to January 1, 1997 violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution and the Retroactivity Clause of the Ohio Constitution. Subsequently these same arguments were rejected by the Supreme Court of Ohio in State v. Cook (1998), 83 Ohio St. 3d 404, 700 N.E.2d 570. The appellate court, however, affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court found that following the Supreme Court's ruling in Cook, this court held that ch. 2950 was unconstitutional under Ohio Const. art.

After the state supreme court rejected the grounds on which the prior dismissal was based, the court of appeals, in another case, found that application of ch. 2950 to sexual predators violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 1. As an appellate court decision finding ch. 2950 unconstitutional as applied to sexual predators was still good law, there was no error in dismissal of the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of raping his six-year-old daughter. Following enactment of the sexual predator registration and notification laws, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950, the trial court held a sexual predator hearing pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The appellate court affirmed on all issues and held that the sexual predator determination scheme set forth in Ohio Rev.

Defendant had the opportunity to present his own evidence and to counter any erroneous information in the pre-sentence report. Proceedings undertaken pursuant to &sect; 2950.09 did not violate the equal protection clause. The provisions of &sect; 2950 are remedial, not punitive, in nature, and the absence of any punitive element in &sect; 2950 necessarily precluded the statute from being an unconstitutional bill of attainder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of rape and was sentenced to nine years in prison. Appellant was also determined by the court to be a sexual predator under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 (statute). Appellant sought review, challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The court noted that recent court decisions had determined that the statute did not violate a prisoner's constitutional rights. The court considered whether the evidence was sufficient to prove by clear and convincing evidence that appellant was likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses. The court noted the trial court held the hearing required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(1), considered the factors listed in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(2), and gave appellant the opportunity to be heard. The court therefore held the trial court did not err in determining appellant to be a sexual predator. Appellant also contended that the court erred in sentencing him to nine years because the record did not support the sentence. The court disagreed because the crime was premeditated and the victim, appellant's sister, suffered serious physical and psychological harm as a result of the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a ruling of the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) that found him to be a sexual predator pursuant to the newly enacted Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court found defendant to be a sexual predator under the newly enacted Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950, defendant appealed and asserted constitutional challenges to the new law. The court noted that the state supreme court had already decided that &sect; 2950 did not violate the Retroactivity Clause of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 or the Ex Post Facto Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court also rejected claims based upon violations of due process, equal protection, double jeopardy, right to privacy, and cruel and unusual punishment based on its own recent decision in another case. The court then considered defendant's assertion that the evidence against him was insufficient as a matter of law to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses, as required by &sect; 2950. While the court held that the trier of fact could use past behavior in determining an offender's propensity to commit future crimes, it agreed with defendant that the evidence in his case had been insufficient. The court therefore vacated the sexual predator determination and ordered that defendant's institutional record be amended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of gross sexual imposition following an incident where he grabbed a woman between her legs in a mall parking lot. The trial court issued an order finding appellant to be a sexual predator following a sexual predator hearing under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950. On appeal, the court overruled appellant's challenges to the constitutionality of &sect; 2950 because the court had reviewed and rejected a similar challenge in a prior case. The court also found that the state had met its burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that appellant was likely to commit a sexually-oriented offense in the future. The court's finding was based on its acknowledgement of the evidence presented at trial, which included a psychologist's opinion that appellant was likely to commit such offenses in the future, a probation officer's report which established a pattern of progressively dangerous sexual behavior, and a police officer's testimony that appellant had admitted seeing the victim, having thoughts about her, following her, and accosting the victim with the intention of grabbing her in her private area.

Relying on the information from the convictions noted, appellant was classified as a sexual predator under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(A).

The evidence presented at the hearing was sufficient to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that appellant was likely to engage in one or more sexually oriented offenses in the future. The crime was particularly heinous, especially because of the parent-child type of relationship between appellant and the victim.

The trial court subsequently adjudicated defendant a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.01(E).

The court found the trial court properly considered the factors listed in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.09(B)(2) in making its determination. After reviewing the evidence, the court held that there was relevant, competent, and credible evidence to support defendant's adjudication as a sexual predator. There was proof that the victim was under thirteen at the time of the offense, that defendant's conduct was ongoing, and that defendant had participated in a sex offender program. Because the trial court's decision was supported by clear and convincing evidence and was not against the manifest weight of evidence, it was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11(A). Appellee moved to suppress the crack, and the trial court granted the motion because appellee's arrest for jaywalking was illegal under &sect; 2925.26. The prosecution appealed, claiming appellee's freedom from arrest under &sect; 2925.26 was not a constitutional right and, thus, appellee's situation did not merit application of the exclusionary rule. The court affirmed, holding that the exclusionary rule applied because there was no probable cause, and appellee's arrest was an unreasonable seizure under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Ohio Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that defendant was a &quot;sexually oriented offender&quot; and defendant appealed. The court on appeal rejected defendant's constitutional challenges to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. Chapter 2950. The court determined that it had previously addressed and rejected identical constitutional challenges. The court held that Chapter 2950 was not ex post facto legislation, nor did it violate defendant's due process rights or the equal protection clause. The legislation was not void for vagueness, was not an unconstitutional bill of attainder, and did not constitute double jeopardy or cruel or unusual punishment. Appellant asserted that the trial court erred in determining that he was likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses. However, the court found that the trial court did not make that determination and, thus, did not adjudicate appellant to be a &quot;sexual predator.&quot; The trial court merely found that appellant had committed a sexually oriented offense, as defined in &sect; 2950.01(D), and therefore was a &quot;sexually oriented offender.&quot; Accordingly, the court affirmed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of abduction, assault, robbery, and felonious assault and was subsequently determined to be a sexually oriented offender under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 et seq. Defendant claimed that abduction was not a sexually oriented offense, but the court found that defendant was convicted of felonious assault with the intention to gratify his sexual needs, which was included in the statute. Defendant argued that he was sentenced prior to the effective date of the statute, but the court held there was nothing in the statute that purported to limit the determination of a sexually oriented offender only to defendants convicted on or after the effective date of the legislation. Defendant claimed that the statute was an unconstitutional deprivation of his right against double jeopardy and was cruel and unusual punishment, however the court held that the notification and registration requirements of the sexual predator statute were remedial in nature, rather that punitive, and that the requirements were constitutional in scope as well as application.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected defendant's claim that plaintiff state failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was a sexual predator. There was evidence showing that defendant was likely to engage in similar behavior in the future.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant engaged in anal sex with a neighboring boy on multiple occasions over a period of several years. Eventually, he was charged with and convicted of two counts of rape and one count of corruption of a minor and sentenced to life imprisonment. Subsequently, a hearing was held, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.09, to determine whether he was a sexual predator. Evidence regarding the abuse and convictions was presented without objection. Defendant did not introduce any evidence or call any witnesses. He was then classified as a sexual predator, and he appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that the classification was supported by sufficient clear and convincing evidence that he was likely to commit a sexual offense in the future, given his past conduct. Moreover, the sexual predator statutory scheme, Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.01 et seq., was not unconstitutional. The statute was not an ex post facto law, a bill of attainder, or void for vagueness. It did not impose a cruel and unusual punishment, and classification did not violate defendant's rights against double jeopardy.

Appellant moved the trial court to modify his sentence and the trial court denied his motion. Appellant alleged that the trial court erred in denying his motion to modify his sentence pursuant to the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58(B). The court found that appellant moved to modify his sentence after the expiration of time for his direct appeal, and as such the trial court could not entertain appellant's petition for postconviction relief unless appellant showed that he was either unavoidably prevented from discovering the facts upon which he relied in his petition, or that a reasonable factfinder could not have found him guilty but for constitutional error at trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order vacating the default judgment. In an action alleging slander of title, and breach of a fiduciary duty or conspiracy, appellee owner's association was served with the complaint by serving the secretary of state pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The court found that in order to prevail appellee had to show that it had a meritorious defense or claim to present, the party was entitled to relief under the grounds stated in the rule, and the motion was made within a reasonable time. The court held that the decision to grant relief was entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court and abuse of discretion connoted conduct that was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable, and the requirement of a meritorious defense was met by the filing of an answer that contained an affirmative defense, or facts sufficient to support the claim of a valid defense, and it was uncontroverted that appellee never actually received notice of the action.</SPAN></P>

The warden where defendant was incarcerated filed a screening form with the court, recommending defendant be adjudicated as a sexual predator. The court entered its finding that defendant was a sexual predator. Defendant argued that the judgment finding him to be a sexual predator was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court found that judgments supported by some competent and credible evidence, going to all the essential elements of the case, would not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court found there was sufficient competent and credible evidence presented to the court that defendant had demonstrated a pattern of violent and brutal sexual behavior and had failed to rehabilitate himself during his previous incarcerations. Therefore the trial court's judgment was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment that adjudicated him a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09. Defendant was convicted and sentenced for sexual battery in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.03. After his conviction, Ohio's new sexual predator law went into effect. Subsequently, the warden of the correctional institution recommended that the court find defendant to be a sexual predator. Defendant's counsel moved to dismiss on ex post facto and retroactivity grounds. The trial court found that defendant met the statutory criteria to be classified as a sexual predator. On appeal, the court noted that the Ohio Supreme Court had found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09, as applied to conduct prior to the effective date of the statute, did not violate the retroactivity clause Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, nor did it violate the ex post facto clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Defendant's classification was proper because defendant took advantage of his special relationship with his victims to become involved in an abusive sexual relationship with both children.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's claims of violations of the constitutional ex post facto prohibition, of his right against double jeopardy, and of his right to equal protection of the laws were not well-taken under the authority of existing case law precedent. Appellant's claim that the statute was unconstitutionally vague also failed. Appellant was unable to sustain his burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that, upon examining the statute, an individual of ordinary intelligence would not have understood what particular activities the statute was intended to forbid. The court found that the statute was not imprecisely drafted and concluded that the statute provided the flexibility necessary to determine sexual predator status on a case-by-case basis while preserving minimal guidelines for making such classification.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2745.01 and under the common law governing the determination of the existence of an employer intentional tort. Plaintiff argued that under the common law defendant subjected plaintiff to a dangerous condition by forcing him to manually lower and pin the pusher dog, was substantially certain that appellant would be harmed by this condition, and forced him to continue to be exposed to this condition despite defendant's knowledge and certainty of harm. The court noted that the deliberate removal of a safety guard was but one of many facts to be weighed in considering a motion for summary judgment in an employer intentional tort case. The judgment was affirmed on appeal because defendant had specific safety procedures and trained its employees in these procedures. While the failure to repair the dog wheels may have been negligent, that negligence did not rise to the substantial certainty required for proving an employer intentional tort.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder and was sentenced to death for killing a young woman he met in a bar. Defendant strangled the victim, mutilated her, and killed her by driving a railroad spike through her temple. Defendant alleged 20 assignments of error including improper admission of evidence, improper composition of the jury, ineffective assistance of counsel, improper consideration of mitigating evidence, and improper consideration of aggravating circumstances. The appellate court, while recognizing certain errors by the trial court, found no error that rose to the level of plain error. Specifically, the appellate court found that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of a prior sexual assault conviction because the circumstances were too dissimilar for the prior incident to constitute evidence of defendant's modus operandi. But the court found that the error was harmless. The appellate court, therefore, affirmed defendant's conviction and sentencing in all respects.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 2950.09(E). Defendant appealed his classification as a habitual sex offender on the grounds that the statute was unconstitutional, and the classification was against the manifest weight of evidence. The court rejected defendant's argument that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950 was unconstitutional based on precedent. The court found that defendant had to be convicted or have pleaded guilty of a sexually-oriented offense to be classified a habitual sex offender. Though none of defendant's convictions were sexually-oriented, defendant's felonious assault conviction could qualify as a sexually-oriented offense if it was committed to gratify defendant's sexual needs or desires. Because the trial court did not make a finding as to whether defendant's assault offense was committed to gratify his sexual needs or desires, the court reversed the habitual sex offender classification and remanded the case so the trial court could make a determination regarding gratification.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant asserted 11 assignments of error that challenged Ohio's sexual predator statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950. The court overruled all assignments of error. The court found that the sexual predator statute was not an unconstitutional bill of attainder or ex post facto law. The statute did not violate equal protection, due process, or double jeopardy rights. Defendant's right to privacy was not violated nor was he subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Additionally, the court determined that clear and convincing evidence existed to support the trial court's finding that defendant was likely to engage in sexually oriented offenses in the future.

The court said that the past behavior included evidence that appellant's past sexual conduct was with his twin four-year old daughters who he vaginally and anally raped over a period of time; that he threatened to kill one of the girls if she told anyone of his conduct; and he had a prior conviction for possession of marijuana.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The appellate court determined that the sexual predator statute was constitutional, and that clear and convincing evidence supported the lower court's determination that appellant was a sexual predator. The appellate court further concluded that the clear and convincing standard as employed in the sexual predator proceeding was constitutional because it was a civil proceeding that was separate from the criminal proceeding and that the standard sufficiently protected appellant's due process rights in the sexual predator determination hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to sexual battery and felonious assault. The lower court conducted a sexual predator determination hearing. In a journal entry and corresponding sentencing addendum filed by the lower court, the lower court stated appellant was automatically classified as a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(A). This appeal followed. The court summarily dismissed appellant's constitutional challenges to the sexual predator statute. Next, appellant asserted that the evidence presented at his hearing was insufficient to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was a sexual predator. Appellant's guilty pleas for sexual battery and felonious assault qualified as sexually-oriented offenses under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01(D)(1) and (3), respectively. However, the automatic classification provision of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(A) clearly did not apply to appellant. Therefore, appellant could be classified as a sexual predator only in accordance with Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city enacted Medina, Ohio, Codified Ordinance 1113.06 to begin an open space and land program. The ordinance required either payment of a fee or dedication of land as a prerequisite to obtaining a building permit for new home purchasers and real estate developers. Plaintiff developer brought an action challenging the ordinance. The trial court declared the ordinance to be an unconstitutional taking of property without due process. Defendant appealed. The court noted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.03 permitted an interested party whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a municipal ordinance to have determined any question of construction or validity arising under such ordinance and to obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder. Thus, in an action for declaratory judgment the trial court was required to fully address the issues presented and to make a declaration of the rights, status or legal relations of the parties. The judgment was reversed and remanded because the trial court made a summary declaration of unconstitutionality and failed to set forth constitutional standards or factual findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court granting summary judgment to plaintiff was reversed and remanded because the trial court made only a conclusory declaration that the ordinance at issue was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed reversal was necessary where evidence was obtained from a warrantless search, the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction, and defendant was sentenced in excess of the guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for having a weapon while under disability, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.13, was upheld where suppression was unnecessary and defendant was properly sentenced. Police arrived at defendant's home upon a gunshot report. At the scene, defendant was agitated and police handcuffed him. Police entered the duplex home of defendant's sister and found a handgun that had been thrown through a window. Police discovered bullets in defendant's duplex home and his car. Defendant brought a motion to suppress, which was denied. Defendant was convicted and appealed, claiming that the trial court erred in failing to suppress, that the evidence was insufficient to convict, and that the trial court exceeded sentencing guidelines. The reviewing court affirmed, holding that where there was reasonable cause to search the premises based on the report of gunshots and defendant's agitated behavior, suppression was unwarranted. Because there was circumstantial evidence that defendant possessed the handgun, sufficient evidence to convict existed. Where defendant's incarceration was consistent with the purposes of felony sentencing, the sentence was upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment modifying defendant father's child support obligation to plaintiff mother because the trial court did not err by failing to deduct unreimbursed ordinary and necessary business expenses for purposes of calculating his income. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3113.21.5(F) only afforded the deduction to self-employed individuals. Contrary to defendant's contention, the statute's distinction between self-employed individuals and individuals otherwise employed was not unconstitutional because it bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose. By allowing only self-employed individuals to deduct ordinary and necessary business expenses, the legislature provided a fair and accurate way of determining the gross receipts of those individuals thereby insuring accurate and fair calculation of child support obligations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was adjudicated a sexual predator at a hearing that followed his entry of guilty pleas to 18 sex offenses. Prevailing case law indicated that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 was not violative of the United States or Ohio constitutions. Defendant's prior conviction for a sexually oriented offense combined with his assault, over a period of years, of two young boys was sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that defendant was likely to commit a sexually oriented offense in the future. In view of the undisputed facts revealed during the sexual predator hearing and defendant's guilty pleas to 18 sex offenses, the court could not disturb the trial court's finding that clear and convincing evidence supported its determination that defendant was a sexual predator. Ohio R. Evid. 101(C)(3) made the Rules of Evidence inapplicable to proceedings for sentencing and proceedings with respect to release on bail or otherwise, and the Ohio Supreme Court specifically held that the rules did not strictly apply to sexual predator determination hearings. Therefore, defendant's adjudication as a sexual predator was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case. On appeal, the trial court was not found to have erred in finding the resolution to have been lawful and in compliance with Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court disagreed with appellant's contention that Ohio Rev.

Appellant also contended that the conviction was against the weight of the evidence. The court reviewed the evidence, including appellant's wife testimony about appellant beating her with a hammer, and a neighbor's testimony about wife coming to neighbor's house distraught, wounded, and bleeding. The evidence also showed that when the police arrived they found appellant sitting with his face in his hands, a hammer between the couch and loveseat, and bloodstains, that the paramedics found wife unconscious and unresponsive, and that a physician testified wife was unconscious, unable to breath, and had extensive bruises and a laceration. Also, the bloodstains on appellant's clothes were consistent with wife's blood type.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's argument that an investigator experienced in child abuse improperly testified as to the foster child victim's veracity, ruling that testimony was permitted to show only that the victim's behavior was consistent with that of other sexually-abused children. Other acts involving the victim and defendant, apart from those charged, were admissible under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(D), even though in camera hearing was not first conducted, as defendant did not object at trial and used the evidence to impeach the victim. Efforts by defendant, convicted of rape, to cross-examine witnesses about alleged prior false accusations by the victim were barred by the statute's rape-shield provisions when falsity was not shown. Moreover, an incorrect in-court statement to corroborate a complaining witness was neither inadmissible hearsay nor shown to be prejudicial. And a clear defense strategy to cast doubt on the victim could not support charges of ineffective counsel. Instructions explaining the force needed to commit rape need not include threats of force, given a foster parent's authority over a child. Finally, sufficient evidence supported the conviction.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was also adjudicated a sexually oriented offender under &sect; 2950.01 et seq. Appellant sought review of his convictions and sentence and the appellate court affirmed, finding that &sect; 2905.05(B)(1), as applied to conduct prior to the effective date of the statute, did not violate the retroactivity clause of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 or the ex post facto clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court determined that the maximum sentences imposed were supported by clear and convincing evidence. The court said that the rape offense carried a mandatory prison term and left the trial court, in its discretion, to determine the most effective way to comply with the purposes and principles that guided felony sentencing under &sect; 2929.11. The court concluded that as to the sexual battery offense, the trial court properly considered the physical and mental injuries suffered by the victim, which were exacerbated by the age of the victim.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court stated that the registration and notification provisions of &sect; 2950, formerly H.B. 180, had been declared to be not violative of the United States Constitution on ex post facto grounds because those provisions were not clearly punitive in effect and they did not serve the remedial purpose of protecting the public.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was found guilty of abduction in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.02. Later, the trial court issued its order stating that the motion of appellee to dismiss Ohio H.B. 180 proceedings was granted. Pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The appellate court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded for hearing on the merits under &sect; 2950.09.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision of the Athens County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) granting summary judgment in favor of appellees in appellees' action for breach of contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The application for appellees' medical school contained a contract. Appellant was allegedly told he would have a better chance of being admitted if he signed the contract. Appellant signed the contract which indicated his intention to practice medicine in the state for at least five years after completion of his postgraduate medical training. After appellant graduated, he left the state and appellees sent him a letter regarding his commitment. A decision granting summary judgment to appellees in a breach of contract suit was affirmed. There was no evidence that appellant was illiterate or unable to comprehend the contract. There was no special or fiduciary relationship between appellant and appellee, nor an absence of a meaningful choice on appellant's part. There was no evidence of coercion or duress. The damages were determined by applying undisputed amounts to the formula provided in the contract. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3337.14 set forth the legitimate governmental interest of training doctors to serve the people of the state. A rational way to achieve the goal was to require students to be residents or non-residents who indicated an intent to practice medicine in the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment because there was no genuine issue of material fact concerning appellant's competency, mutuality, or unconscionability. The classification of nonresident students rationally advanced a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court noted that because appellant failed to object to jury instructions, the right to appeal was waived absent plain error. The court held that the indictment was legally sufficient and that appellant had adequate notice of the charges against him because the principal offender indictment gave appellant sufficient notice of the charge. Furthermore, an aiding and abetting jury instruction was proper because appellant was indicted as a principal offender and there was sufficient evidence adduced at trial to support the instruction. In addition, the verdict forms sufficiently instructed the jury. Moreover, the trial court's ex parte communication with the jury was harmless because there was no possibility that the jury was influenced. Finally, the court held that appellant failed to raise the only affirmative defense available set forth in the complicity statute under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.03(E). Therefore, appellant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for felonious assault because the indictment sufficiently gave appellant notice of the charges, the aiding and abetting jury instruction was proper, the verdict forms sufficiently instructed the jury, the jury selection was not racially biased, the trial court's ex parte communication with the jury was harmless, and appellant failed to assert the proper affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) finding appellant guilty of violating an order to obtain a detailed chemical and physical analysis of a representative sample of waste, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3734.11 and 3734.99, and recklessly storing hazardous waste, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3734.02(F), 3734.11, and 3734.99.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant rented property to a painting business. Appellant later discovered the business left a number of drums on the property. The state Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) discovered the barrels and had a representative sampling done. Certain liquid material was hazardous waste. The EPA informed appellant that it was his responsibility to have the barrels tested and properly disposed of in a licensed facility. The drums were later found in a broken down truck. A judgment convicting appellant of violating the EPA's order and recklessly storing hazardous waste was affirmed. The state demonstrated that the act of disposing of the waste was capable of being performed, and appellant did not prove that he was incapable of paying for the tests. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3734 provided adequate guidelines and standards. Regardless of how the barrels got onto appellant's property, appellant was aware of the barrels and, despite numerous instructions to do so, failed to have them tested and continued to store them on his property. Although appellant did not cause the barrels to be on his property, once discovered, he did hold the hazardous waste on his property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction because appellant did not establish his incapability of paying for the test as an affirmative defense, and the legislative grant of authority was not unconstitutional or improper. Appellant was not convicted of failing to do a vain act, nor convicted for the acts of another, but for his own reckless disobedience.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the order, finding that the divorce of appellant triggered one of three statutory events under which appellees could seek visitation. The court determined that &sect; 3109.051(B)(1) was enacted by the General Assembly, an acknowledged source of public policy, and that such statute presupposed that contact between grandparents and their grandchildren was in the children's best interest. The court found that the trial court reviewed all of the factors in Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted defendant convict's motion to dismiss sexual predator proceedings. The trial court found that the application of the sexual predator law, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950, to those convicted under prior law violated both the ex post facto clause of the federal constitution and the retroactivity clause of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to rape prior to the effective date of a sexual predator law, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950. After the law went into effect, the state initiated sexual predator proceedings against defendant. The trial court dismissed the proceedings because it found that applying &sect; 2950 to those convicted under prior law violated the ex post facto clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and the retroactivity clause of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The state appealed, citing recent case law holding that neither the ex post facto clause nor the retroactivity clause was violated in these circumstances. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the sexual predator proceedings on an alternative ground. The court held &sect; 2950 violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court noted that &sect; 2950 was an exercise of the state's police powers and that a state's exercise of police power was unconstitutional if it was unreasonable or arbitrary. The court concluded that &sect; 2950 was unconstitutional on its face because it unreasonably interfered with the rights of individuals beyond the necessities of the situation and was unduly oppressive upon the individual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment that granted defendant's motion to dismiss sexual predator proceedings was affirmed on alternative grounds. The court found that numerous specific provisions of the sexual predator law violated the state constitution. Additionally, the court found that striking them individually would have disrupted the statutory scheme. Thus, the court declared the sexual predator law void in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were sentenced to prison for numerous sexual assaults. While serving their sentences, defendants were brought back to court for sexual predator hearings pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(C)(2). The public defender filed a motion to dismiss the proceedings as unconstitutional. The trial court granted the motion finding the amended provisions of Am. Sub. H.B. 180 (Ohio 1997) were violative of the ex post facto clause, the retroactive laws, and Ohio R. Crim. P. 11. State argued that the amendments were not punitive in nature but remedial and, thus, their retroactive application was constitutional. Section 2950.09(B)(1), as applied to conduct prior to the effective date of the statute, did not violate the retroactivity clause of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 and did not violate the ex post facto clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Defendants argue they were not advised of all possible consequences under Ohio R. Crim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted felonious penetration of a minor, and the State attempted to classify him as a sexual predator under Ohio Rev.

Defendant appealed the determination, arguing that the state law was unconstitutional. The court held that the State's sexual predator law was constitutional, as it was remedial and not punitive in nature. The court determined that the law was not an ex post facto law, did not violate defendant's right to privacy, did not impose cruel and unusual punishment, did not violate equal protection, was not vague, and was not a bill of attainder. The court also stated that evidence of defendant's conviction for a sex offense was sufficient to find him to be a sexual predator by clear and convincing evidence, and that this determination did not implicate defendant's procedural or substantive Due Process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought habeas corpus relief from his parole revocation. The court granted respondent's motion to dismiss the habeas corpus petition because the complaint was without merit. Petitioner's petition did not have all of his commitment papers attached as required by Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2725.04(D), which was sufficient to dismiss the petition, standing alone. Petitioner's allegation that he was denied effective assistance of counsel was without merit, as he was not absolutely entitled to counsel at the revocation hearing. The issues were not complex or difficult to develop, and petitioner would not have been denied due process even if counsel had not been assigned. Further, there was evidence other than petitioner's admission, provoked when counsel instructed petitioner to plead guilty to the violation, that he committed the violation. Respondent's claim that the petition should be dismissed for failing to submit an affidavit that petitioner did not participate in prior civil actions pursuant to &sect; 2969.25(A) was without merit, as petitioner was not obliged to submit such affidavit when he was not a party to other litigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of the unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. He was given three years community control and sent to a community correctional facility. He was released after having successfully completed the 180-day program.

He was given 12 months on the unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, but no credit for the time served. From that judgment and sentence, appellant sought review designating two assignments of error. The appellate court overruled the first assignment of error. The trial court did not err in sentencing appellant to a maximum term of 12 months. However, the appellate court sustained the second assignment of error. A person confined in a community correctional facility was entitled to credit for time served there as much as any other person confined in anywhere else.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was indicted for the rape of a child. He was arrested and bond was set. He remained in jail until he entered an Alford plea of guilty to attempted gross sexual imposition and was released on his own recognizance. The State moved to revoke bond for appellant's violation of the terms and condition of bind. Appellant failed to appear and the trial court revoked his bond and ordered his arrest. He then entered an Alford plea of guilty to attempted gross sexual imposition and a guilty plea to failure to appear. The trial court imposed consecutive sentences of 18 months and two years. On appeal, appellant attacked the sentences arguing that he was being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment as to the two year sentence and that the 18-month maximum sentence imposed was not supported by the sentencing guidelines. The court affirmed holding that the record amply supported the imposition of the 18-month maximum sentence and that the two year sentence was not so harsh as to shock the community sense of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of a rape occurring in 1995, but was not sentenced until September 30, 1996.

The instant court granted permission for the appellant to reopen his appeal. Before the appeal was heard, the Ohio Supreme Court rejected a defendant's claim that by creating an exception to Ohio Rev.

The ranger arrested appellant, and appellant was charged with importuning in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.07(B). The trial court denied appellant's motion to dismiss and convicted appellant. On appeal, the court reversed. Section 2907.07(B) did not violate U.S. Const. amends.

Appellant's statement could not be construed as &quot;fighting words&quot; under &sect; 2907.07(B) because appellant neither asked the ranger to perform an act, nor moved towards the ranger, nor removed any clothing.

Plaintiffs alleged that the school district negligently maintained the grounds and created the existence of the physical defect, that defendant playground aide was reckless and failed to exercise ordinary care in carrying out the school's policy, which required her to take the rock away from the student or remove it from the playground. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendants, holding that the rock did not constitute a physical defect and that defendant playground aide did not act recklessly. Moreover, the trial court concluded that defendants were protected by the principles of sovereign immunity. On appeal, the court reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of two counts of corruption of a minor, and was sentenced to serve prison terms. Having been convicted of two or more sexual offenses, appellant was considered an habitual sexual offender, and was required to register with law enforcement authorities for 10 years after his release from prison pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.06. The legislature thereafter modified the statute to change the sexual offender classifications. After the state moved to classify appellant as a sexual predator under the modified statute, appellant moved to dismiss the proceedings as unconstitutional. When his motion was denied, he consented to be classified as a sexually oriented offender. On appeal, the court held that the modified statute was constitutional as applied to appellant. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 was not a retroactive law prohibited by Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, and did not violate the ex post facto provision of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which entered a conviction against him for the second-degree felony of possession of marijuana, Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted for the second-degree felony of possession of marijuana, he appealed, alleging several points of error. First, defendant argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel where his counsel failed to file and argue a motion to suppress his alleged confession obtained by officers. The court held that where defendant confessed to possessing the marijuana prior to invoking his right to counsel, his invocation of the right to counsel did not present a proper basis for filing a motion to suppress the confession; therefore, his counsel did not render ineffective assistance by failing to file a motion to suppress. Second, defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11(C)(3) was unconstitutional where it provided a fixed mandatory prison sentence. The court held that &sect; 2925.11(C)(3) was not unconstitutional on the basis that it provided for a fixed mandatory prison sentence because, unless otherwise constrained, the legislature had the authority not only to fix the duration of a sentence, but also to define the nature of confinement. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for possession of marijuana, holding that the statute which provided for a fixed mandatory prison sentence for possession of marijuana was not unconstitutional because, unless otherwise constrained, it was within the province of the legislature not only to fix the duration of a sentence, but also to define the nature of the confinement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with violation of the Girard, Ohio, City Ordinance No. 6108-89, the Exterior Property Maintenance Code, for allowing exposed wood and celotex, missing gutters and downspouts, yard debris, construction debris, tall weeds, dead branches, tree stumps, and peeling paint on trim on his property. The trial court denied appellant's motions to dismiss and issued its judgment entry finding appellant guilty of the charges contained in the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that appellant waived his constitutional and selective enforcement arguments by failing to raise the points before the trial court. The conviction did not constitute double jeopardy because the rules of double jeopardy did not attach to appellant's flagrant actions, where each day that the violation was not corrected a new offense occurred. The zoning board's failure to provide appellant with a written notice of its final order was not harmful, because the board was not required to provide appellant with written notice of its decision.</SPAN></P>

Appellants counterclaimed. The trial court dismissed the counterclaim because of appellants' failure to file a &quot;certificate of merit,&quot; as required under Ohio Rev. Code. Ann. &sect; 2305.011. The appeals court affirmed, holding that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because the statute's certainty could be ascertained by the application of commonly accepted tools of judicial construction. The trial court properly granted appellee's motion to dismiss because appellants failed to file a certificate of merit within 90 days after appellee filed its reply to their counterclaim. The court found that appellants never tolled the running of the 90-day time limit for filing the certificate by filing a written discovery request during the 90 days after appellee filed its reply. The court further concluded that appellants' other arguments were not raised in the trial court and were therefore waived. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Under a plea bargain, he had pled no contest to one count of rape on June 6, 1997. The state withdrew the other two counts and the force specification. The acts to which he had pled guilty occurred between October 1995, and April 1997. The record showed that he had served time after pleading guilty to a prior charge of gross sexual imposition. Though he was told by the trial court, before it accepted his plea, that he could be found to be a sexual offender at a later hearing under &sect; 2950.09, he entered his no contest plea. In affirming the judgment, the court specifically rejected defendant's attacks against &sect; 2950.09 under the federal and state constitutions, and concluded that there was no abuse of discretion in finding that defendant was a sexual predator as there was clear and convincing evidence of his potential for future recidivism where he already had been a sexually offending recidivist.</SPAN></P>

Defendant urged, inter alia, that the trial court denied him constitutional due process and his statutory right to a jury trial, and that it was error to overrule his suppression motion without a hearing. He argued that the assessment of an additional $ 9 charge for a minor misdemeanor under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.70 increased the fine for his offense to $ 109 and that Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of domestic violence after his wife alerted police that he had choked and threatened to kill her. He received the maximum sentence of 12 months' incarceration. He sought review, arguing that there were discrepancies between the testimonial evidence given at trial and the photographic evidence of his wife's injuries, and they established that the jury's verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court disagreed, noting that the state need only show that appellant attempted to cause his wife harm in order to satisfy the elements of the offense. Appellant claimed that the trial court erred in failing to sustain his objection to an officer's testimony regarding his wife's past state of mind of fright. Such testimony was the type precluded from admission by Ohio R. Evid. 803(3). However, the court found that the error was harmless because there was no reasonable possibility that the evidence could have contributed to appellant's conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of an automobile collision, defendant was arrested and charged with aggravated vehicular assault under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.08(A) and aggravated vehicular homicide under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.06(A) for unlawfully terminating another's pregnancy. Defendant appealed, arguing that &sect; 2903.06(A) violated her rights to equal protection of the law, due process, and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, and that the statute established and fostered religious purposes. The court affirmed and ruled that defendant, in assaulting a pregnant woman and causing the fetal death, was not similarly situated to a pregnant woman who elected to have her fetus terminated by one legally authorized to do so, and that &sect; 2903.06(A) was rationally related to the state interest of protecting unborn children. The court also ruled that &sect; 2903.06(A) was precise and not vague, that defendant's incarceration was not disproportionate under U.S. Const. amend. VII merely because a woman legally terminating her own pregnancy was not punished, and that &sect; 2903.06(A) did not violate the establishment clause of U.S. Const. amend. I because it had a secular purpose and did not advance religion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for aggravated vehicular homicide for unlawfully terminating another's pregnancy. The court ruled that the statute defining the offense did not deny defendant's rights to equal protection of the law, due process, and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, and that the statute had a secular purpose of protecting unborn children from criminal activity and did not foster religious beliefs.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was stopped by a police officer and gave the officer incorrect information. Ohio Rev.

A legislative body need not define every word it uses in an enactment. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.13(A)(3) was not constitutionally repugnant or void for vagueness.

On review, the court examined the record and testimony and held that the rape conviction was not against the weight of the evidence. The court noted that the exhibit, which alluded to prior sexual activity, was properly excluded. The court held that the rape shield statute prohibited the introduction of this extrinsic evidence under the circumstances.

Defendant entered into a plea agreement and pled guilty to 18 of the 36 counts. The trial court accepted his plea agreement and thereafter conducted a hearing and determined that defendant was a sexual predator in accordance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01. Defendant appealed the trial court's determination contending that the above-mentioned statute was unconstitutional and the trial court's determination was against the manifest weight of evidence. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held the statute was constitutional, thus overruled defendant's first contention. Secondly, the court held the state established through clear and convincing evidence that defendant was a sexual predator. The court reasoned the state showed that defendant had been convicted of a sexual oriented offense and was likely to engage in such conduct in the future, therefore sufficiently illustrated that defendant was a sexual predator within the statutory confines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrators' decedents were killed in a car crash with an underinsured motorist. The motorist's insurer made a payment to resolve the administrators' wrongful death claims. The administrators then filed an action on behalf of decedents' families against the insurer seeking underinsured motorist benefits under insurance policies issued by the insurer to the decedents' father and ex-husband. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the insurer, finding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18, as amended by Am. Sub. S.B. 20 (Ohio 1994), precluded the administrators' claims. The court affirmed the judgment in part, and reversed it in part. The court held that &sect; 3937.18, as amended, (1) was constitutional; (2) applied to the action because a statute pertaining to an insurance policy enacted after the policy's issuance was incorporated into a renewal of such policy when the renewal represented a new contract of insurance separate from the initial policy; (3) limited the amount of the insurer's liability under the policies; and (4) was no bar to recovery because it did not require that a physical injury be sustained by an insured, only that a loss be incurred by the insured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment finding that the administrators could not maintain an action seeking underinsured benefits under a policy issued by the insurer, and it affirmed the judgment limiting the amount recoverable under the insurer's policies. The court remanded the action to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

COTA had filed a complaint averring that appellant had engaged in habitual and persistent vexatious conduct against COTA and that he was a vexatious litigator as defined in Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being declared a vexatious litigator, appellant contended that the vexatious litigator statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2323.52, was unconstitutional. The court found that the bulk of the statute was constitutional; however, a provision of the statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2323.52(G), was found to be unconstitutional because its blanket prohibition of a right to appeal denied the right created by Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16. Accordingly, the court sustained in part and overruled in part appellant's first assignment of error. The court sustained appellant's second assignment of error, finding that summary judgment was inappropriate because COTA failed to show that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether or not appellant was a vexatious litigator. COTA's motion for summary judgment listed 62 cases to prove that appellant was a vexatious litigator; the court found, however, that nearly all of them involved federal cases or conduct occurring in cases that were prior to March 18, 1997, the effective date of the statute; thus, those items could not be used as evidence to support a finding that appellant was a vexatious litigator. The court reversed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant sought review of an order of the Lorain County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which after defendant pled guilty to four counts of rape, entered judgment designating defendant a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on four counts of rape. He pled guilty to all four counts. Defendant was sentenced accordingly. At a later date a hearing was held for the purpose of determining whether defendant was a sexual predator as defined by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B). The lower court adjudicated defendant a sexual predator. Defendant argued that the lower court's adjudication of him, as a sexual predator was incorrect because: (1) the sexual predator statute was unconstitutional; and (2) he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The appellate court held that the sexual predator statute was constitutional because it did not impose an increased sentence as a result of a criminal prosecution. The appellate court further determined that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel because defendant failed to demonstrate that, but for the alleged errors of his attorney, he would not have been adjudicated a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of the sexual predator statute was without merit and that he failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was serving a sentence for rape and kidnapping. The trial court denied his motion to dismiss a hearing to determine his sexual offender classification pursuant to Ohio Rev.

Defendant appealed, asserting that the application of &sect;&sect; 2950.09 and 2950.04 to him violated the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The court affirmed, holding that prisoners were not a suspect class, therefore, the rational basis test applied. The court found that the state's rational basis was better protection for the public from recidivism among sex offenders. The court further found that the state had a rational basis in administrative feasibility of imposing the classification and reporting requirements before the individual is released back into the public. The court concluded that a rational basis existed for the different treatment of persons still in prison for their sexual offenses and persons who were released from prison for their sexual offenses before the effective date of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for driving while under the influence of alcohol. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred as a matter of law in finding that the arresting officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion to justify a constitutional stopband that in failing to suppress the breath-alcohol concentration test results. The court held that the trial court erred as a matter of law in failing to suppress the appellant's horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test results. The officer had probable cause to effect the stop based on a traffic code violation because the officer stopped appellant's vehicle for straying outside of its marked lane of travel. The traffic stop was constitutionally permissible because probable cause existed to believe that appellant committed a traffic offense. Further, the breath-alcohol test was only necessary to prove a violation of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4511.19(A)(3), but the charge was dismissed. If the trial court had ruled that the evidence relating to the HGN test should be excluded, the state still had ample admissible evidence upon which to prosecute appellant for driving while under the influence of alcohol.

The court held that all of appellant's claims that were asserted in his motion for postconviction relief, except those based on the ineffective assistance of counsel, either were or could have been properly asserted on appeal and therefore were barred by res judicata. In addition, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21, no discovery was authorized in a postconviction relief proceeding. Moreover, appellant's claims that his trial counsel's performance was deficient in failing to file a motion to suppress certain evidence and by failing to object to evidence could have been raised on direct appeal, and therefore were also barred by res judicata. Furthermore, the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel on the basis of the failure to advance a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity was unsubstantiated because there was no evidence for counsel to have corroborated this defense at the time of trial.

The court also affirmed the currency seizure because defendant failed to raise the issues in the trial court, and moreover voluntarily waived his right to compliance with forfeiture statutes by signing the plea agreement. With respect to defendant's personal property items, the court found that because the issue was never before the trial court, there existed no judgment on which it could rule, but that it appeared that the prosecution never filed a required forfeiture action and defendant never filed a motion for return of his personalty, so the court instructed him to file such a motion with the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought review of a decision, which affirmed an administrative decision that denied appellant a permit to operate an adult entertainment establishment. Appellant brought her appeal under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506 et seq. and she challenged the application and constitutionality of a zoning ordinance which restricted the use of her property. The court affirmed and held that there was a difference between an administrative appeal under &sect; 2506 et seq. and that of a declaratory judgment action under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721 et. seq. While a review under &sect; 2506 et seq. was limited to only a determination of whether an order, adjudication, or decision was unconstitutional, an action under &sect; 2721 et seq. could have been brought to determine any question of constitutional validity which arose under an ordinance. Appellant's constitutional facial challenge was outside the scope of &sect; 2506 et seq. and therefore failed. There was also no direct conflict between the municipal ordinance and the general state law, so her constitutional preemption challenge failed.</SPAN></P>

The challenged ordinance was not in conflict with any general state law and was therefore not preempted by any general state law. The facial attack on the constitutionality of the statute was outside the scope of an administrative appeal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued a permanent injunction preventing appellants from enforcing the grooming standard against appellee because it found that the standard was not necessary to further a compelling state interest and that requiring appellee to cut his hair was not the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling state interest. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the compelling state interest test did not apply because the grooming standard was religion-neutral in that its object was not to suppress religious conduct, and because it was generally applicable to corrections employees and not enforced only against conduct motivated by religious belief. The court ruled that the standard was the least restrictive means of achieving the compelling state interest of safety and discipline in the prison environment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to three counts of gross sexual imposition and three counts of sexual battery and was classified by the trial court as a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09. Defendant appealed, challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 2950.09 and the sufficiency of the evidence. The court noted that recent caselaw had already determined that &sect; 2950.09 was constitutional and summarily dismissed that argument. The court went on to find that clear and convincing evidence existed to support the decision of the trial court. The court noted that defendant admitted to committing at least six sexual offenses against his four year-old daughter over a period of six months and may have also committed offenses against a young male child as well. In view of defendant's extended pattern of sexual behavior with very young children and the fact that these children were still youthful, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that defendant should be classified as a sexual predator and be required to meet the registration requirements of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that there was clear and convincing evidence in the record to support the trial court's decision that defendant was a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court rejected defendant's challenges to the denial of his motions to suppress and to dismiss, the admission of testimony and evidence from various witnesses, the trial judge's refusal to instruct the jury on a culpable mental state for the offense of operating a vehicle without a licensed driver, and a purportedly improper verdict form. The court further found that it was not error for the trial judge to have admitted opinion evidence from a lay witness as to defendant's intoxication where the witness had the opportunity to observe defendant and had sufficient experience with intoxicated persons to have qualified him to form and to express an opinion on defendant's lack of sobriety. However, the court reversed defendant's conviction for driving without a seatbelt where there was no evidence or testimony to support the conviction. The court concluded by affirming both the operating without a licensed driver and the driving under the influence convictions and remanded the case with an order to terminate defendant's administrative license suspension, retroactive to the date of sentencing, in order to avoid any double jeopardy implications.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, appellant was found guilty of contempt for failing to keep probation office appointments, and a jail sentence of 15 days imposed by the trial court was suspended on the condition of active probation. Then appellant filed a motion to revoke his probation and activate the jail time imposed, as the probation office would not accommodate his work schedule. The trial court granted the motion and ordered appellant to report for jail for 15 days and pay the costs of jail at $ 65.00 per day as an additional fine. After serving the sentence, appellant challenged the order. The court held that the alleged errors as to the 15-day jail sentence were moot as appellant voluntarily served the term. However, the court reversed the order, holding that the $ 65 per day additional fine was unconstitutional as double jeopardy because it was not an effort to recoup confinement costs pursuant to the requirements and procedure in Ohio Rev.

Code &sect; 4301:1-1-53(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Liquor Control Commission entered appellee licensee's premises and saw various gambling devices in violation of Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-53(B). Appellee's liquor license was revoked. Appellee brought an administrative appeal in the lower court. It reversed the liquor license revocation, holding that more than mere possession of gambling devices was to be shown for a violation. It concluded that appellant's actions were not supported by substantial evidence. Appellant argued that the trial court abused its discretion in reversing the liquor license revocation and in determining that such action was not supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence. The court agreed and reversed the lower court's judgment. The lower court was correct insofar as it held that appellant must show more than the mere presence of gambling devices on appellee's premises before revoking its license. However, the trial court ignored the remainder of the stipulated evidence introduced during the administrative hearing. This included boards displaying sign up sheets for daily and weekly drawings, as well as payoff information, cash, and &quot;tip tickets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court. The stipulated evidence introduced before appellant Liquor Control Commission against appellee licensee was sufficient to find a violation of the administrative regulation against gambling. The lower court therefore abused its discretion in reversing the order to revoke appellee's liquor license. The liquor license revocation was not contrary to law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to 18 months for gross sexual imposition and 10 years for kidnapping. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed and held that the sentences were proper because the trial court found defendant posed the greatest likelihood of recidivism, that the prosecution's statements during closing arguments did not constitute misconduct or deny defendant a fair trial, that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for acquittal, that the convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence, and that there was enough evidence to find that defendant was a habitual sex offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Lorain County (Ohio) convicting him of two counts of felonious assault under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.11(A)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As appellant walked passed a gas station, he threw had what appeared to be a red M-80 firecracker, which exploded with a very loud noise, startling everyone at that location. Later that night, appellant was arrested and charged with felonious assault under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.11(A)(2). The indictment specified that the dangerous ordnance appellant used was an M-80 firecracker. Prior to trial, the state successfully moved, over defense counsel's objection, to change the language of the indictment identifying the ordnance as a firecracker. The language settled upon was explosive device. Appellant was found guilty of two counts of felonious assault and challenged the judgment. The court affirmed, holding that the amendment of the indictment merely altered the description of the dangerous ordnance to conform to the evidence and did not pertain to the essence of the offenses charged. The court also found that the jury did not clearly lose its way and reach a decision contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence as the evidence demonstrated that appellant intentionally threw the device with full knowledge of the inherent danger and intended to cause harm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed as the disputed amendment at trial to appellant's indictment merely altered the description of the dangerous ordnance to conform to the evidence and did not pertain to the essence of the offenses charged. Also, the jury's decision was not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from 20 separate judgments of the Court of Common Pleas, County of Medina (Ohio), each of which held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09 and other relevant provisions were retroactive laws in violation of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The state argued that the statutes requiring sexual predator adjudications did not impose new obligations or restrictions and was not retroactive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each of the defendants in the consolidated appeal was convicted of and sentenced for committing a felony sex offense prior to the effective date of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09, which required hearings to determine whether defendants were sexual predators. After the Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections, pursuant to &sect; 2950.09(C)(1), sent recommendations that each defendant be adjudicated a sexual predator, the trial court ruled the statute unconstitutional. Reversing that decision, the court ruled that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 et seq., specifically, the classification provision, the registration provision, and the community notification provision did not violate the Retroactivity Clause of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The court remanded the cases for hearings pursuant to &sect; 2950.09.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision that the Ohio statute relating to the adjudication of sexual predators was retroactive in violation of the Ohio constitution when applied to defendants who committed their offenses before the effective date of the statute. The court remanded the cases for hearings to determine whether the respective defendants should have been classified sexual predators.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff appealed, contending that the trial court erred when it found Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2305.15(A)&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied to defendant, and erred when it allowed a resident of another country to raise a constitutional defense. The court affirmed, holding that Ohio's tolling statute violated the commerce clause and that it could not be constitutionally applied to defendant because he left the state for employment reasons. The court held that because plaintiffs did not show that defendant had absconded from the jurisdiction, the tolling statute did not apply. The court further held that it was not error to have allowed defendant to avail himself of constitutional protections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission argued that the trial court erred in finding the entry of the liquor control enforcement agent onto the organization's premises unlawful.

The agent was not asked for membership credentials until after he had been admitted and after he had seen patrons purchasing and playing tip tickets. This was evidence of gambling activity prohibited under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2915. Thus, the trial court erred in its conclusion to reverse the commission's decision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a trial court judgment, wherein he was found to be a sexual predator under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 2950.09. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in finding him to be a sexual predator and failing to credit him with time served. Defendant entered a guilty plea to kidnapping for the purpose of compelling the victim to engage in sexual conduct. Defendant contended that he would have been released from prison if credited with time served and the trial court would not have jurisdiction to conduct the sexual predator hearing. On appeal, the court found no merit to defendant's contentions. The court found that the statute only required that defendant serve a term of incarceration on or after January 1, 1997, that prior to the time of release the department of rehabilitation recommend that he be adjudicated a sexual predator, and that a hearing be conducted prior to release. The court held that all of the conditions were met and that the evidence supported the trial court's finding. The fact that defendant may have been credited for time served did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction for sexual predator hearing. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, holding that the trial court's finding was not contrary to the evidence. In addition, defendant's record included a kidnapping with intent to engage in sexual contact and two indecency convictions, which supported the trial court's finding. Finally, the court held that all of the statutory conditions were met.</SPAN></P>
