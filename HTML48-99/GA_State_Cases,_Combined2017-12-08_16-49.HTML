The court affirmed the denial of relief as to his armed robbery conviction because it found his objection to the admissibility of a gun taken in the robbery was without merit. The court reversed the denial of habeas corpus relief as to his burglary conviction and vacated that conviction because it found the trial court committed a fatal error when it instructed the jury that the burden was on appellant to prove that he came into possession of the stolen articles in a legitimate way. The court found the instruction resulted in a fundamentally unfair trial because it shifted the burden of proof to appellant to prove his innocence when the burden was on the state to prove his guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sellers filed a complaint to quiet title. After the trial court appointed a special master, the purchasers filed a petition to intervene, alleging they were the purchasers under a certain contract of sale entered into between them and the sellers. The special master allowed the intervention and granted summary judgment to the intervenors for specific performance of the sales contract after declaring title to be in the sellers. The special master's report of his findings and action was approved by the trial court, and it entered an appropriate decree in the case. The sellers appealed. Upon consideration, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the special master had jurisdiction to allow the intervention and to recommend summary judgment for specific performance; and (2) the trial court acted properly in adopting the special master's report on these issues; and (3) because there were no material issues of fact to be resolved in determining the specific performance claim, it was not error for the special master to pass upon this feature of the case in addition to the sellers' original complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Department of Transportation exercised its right of eminent domain in taking the condemnees' property. The superior court awarded the condemnees $ 300 in attorney fees and costs. The Department of Transportation appealed. The court found no error in the award of reasonable attorney fees and costs, which were elements of damages under the constitutional mandate requiring payment of just compensation when the Department of Transportation took private property in eminent domain proceedings. The court found that Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; III, para. I(2) (amended 1972), codified at Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-301(2), did not preclude that judicial construction. The court held that the payment of fees and costs did not violate due process or the constitutional provisions prohibiting gratuities and prescribing the purposes for which taxation was exercised. The court held that the state had no right to a jury trial and waived its challenge to the constitutionality of the statute requiring it to pay interest on the award from the date of taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that although the natural father had visited with the child on occasion over the 12 years since the child's birth and had provided some support from time to time, the natural father made no effort to legitimate the child or to obtain visitation rights until after the stepfather filed the adoption petition. The court noted that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 74-203 placed all parental power in the mother of an illegitimate child, and Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 74-403(3) required only the mother's consent for such child's adoption. The natural father argued that the statutes were unconstitutional as violative of due process and equal protection. The court rejected the natural father's argument, holding that the state was entitled to make valid classifications of children as legitimate and illegitimate, if based upon valid state interests. The court found that the state's interest in promoting the family as an institution for child rearing was a valid state interest. Accordingly, the court upheld Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 74-203, 74-403(3), and affirmed the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

Defendant followed his wife and caught her committing adultery with her lover and killed both people. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision convicting defendant of murder. Defendant argued that his conviction was improper because the killings were justified homicide to prevent adultery. The court rejected defendant's arguments. The court recognized the historical rule that a killing to prevent adultery was justified, but the court explained that this rule had not extended to the killing of the adulterous spouse. The court held that this rule was no longer valid in current society. The court found that the trial court's giving of instructions on the lesser charge of manslaughter was not prejudicial to defendant because defendant was not even entitled to the potential lesser charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, county commissioners and officers, appealed from a ruling of the DeKalb Superior Court (Georgia), which issued a writ of mandamus that ordered them to issue plaintiff property owners a certificate of zoning compliance and a development permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners operated a motel that was adjacent to a golf course. However, the golf course closed due to flooding. The owners applied for a change in zoning classification of the area that was previously a golf course in order to construct an auto raceway, which was denied. The county planning department denied the application for a certificate of zoning compliance because the raceway was not a permitted use within the present classification of zoning of the site and the raceway was not an accessory use incident to a motel. The trial court ordered the issuance of the application and certificate, finding that the continued zoning classification constituted a taking of the property without compensation. On appeal, the court reversed and held that there was no taking in the instant case. There was no showing that maintaining the zoning classification made all possible uses of the land incompatible, just that some uses were incompatible. Further, it was possible that a raceway in the flood plain could affect the public health and, accordingly, the determination was properly made upon balancing competing factors.</SPAN></P>

Appellant intervenor sought review and enumerated 25 alleged errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Affirming the judgment, the court explained that Act creating the authority gave it the power to function and contract in the manner approved by the trial court, and unless the Act was unconstitutional, there was no merit in the intervenor's contention that no provision of law supported the validation. The court addressed each of the constitutional provisions which the intervenor claimed was violated, and ruled that the Georgia constitution permitted the authority's operations and the validation of the bonds. The court noted that there was a violation of the notice provisions, Ga. Code Ann &sect;&sect; 34B-408(i) and 34B-409, because one of the two papers in City of Camilla, due to a power outage, ran one of its two additions without the notice of the hearing. Noting that the purpose of the notice was to give information to the citizens of the political subdivisions contracting with the authority of the proceeding so that they might have resisted the validation of the proposed bond issue, the court ruled that the record showed that the notice was properly published in the other newspaper, and provisions for notice were substantially complied with.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed. A statute was to be held unconstitutional as an improper delegation of legislative power if it was incomplete as legislation and authorized an executive board to decide what should and what should not be an infringement of the law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of conviction entered by the Superior Court of Jefferson County (Georgia), which found defendant guilty of murder, armed robbery, two counts of kidnapping, and two counts of illegal possession of firearms. Defendant was acquitted on one count of kidnapping. Defendant's plea-in-bar of prosecution by the State prior to his arraignment on the charges contained in the Georgia indictment was overruled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted by a federal grand jury and also by a Georgia grand jury for crimes that arose out of the same transaction. Defendant entered pleas of guilty in the district court. Prior to his arraignment on the charges contained in the Georgia indictment, he filed his plea-in-bar of his prosecution by Georgia and relied on Ga. Crim. Code Ann. &sect; 26-507(c). The trial court held that the exclusive jurisdiction of the superior court could not be altered or surrendered to another court or sovereign by an act of the Georgia General Assembly, and it overruled defendant's plea-in-bar. The court held that the plea-in-bar should have been sustained. Section 26-507(c) did not oust the Georgia superior courts of their &quot;exclusive jurisdiction&quot; over the trial of capital felonies. It was a procedural statute as distinguished from a jurisdictional statute in that it merely barred a prosecution by the State if the accused was formerly prosecuted and convicted in a district court for a crime over which there was concurrent jurisdiction. Such a statute could be enacted without contravening the constitutional provision that endowed the superior courts with exclusive jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder, armed robbery, and robbery by intimidation. On review, defendant argued that the trial court erred when it denied his request for a continuance to challenge the array of the grand and trial juries. The court found that defendant's counsel presented no evidence to support his argument that the array of jurors did not represent a fair cross section of the community. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. The court also found that defendant was not entitled to a change of venue based on pre-trial publicity because there was no showing that the jurors had fixed opinions regarding defendant's guilt or innocence. Furthermore, the newspaper articles about the incident were not inflammatory. Finally, the court found that there was no error in imposing the death penalty because the murder was committed while defendant was in the commission of another capital felony and the death penalty was not disproportionate in terms of other similar cases. Therefore, defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The garnisher, by its attorney, made an affidavit before the chief deputy clerk of the civil court that the debtor owed a balance on a described judgment.

In affirming the judgment of the trial court, the court noted that under O.G.C.A. &sect;&sect; 46-102, 46-103 service of summons of garnishment must have been made on the garnishee, but no notice was required to the judgment defendant. O.G.C.A. ch. 46-4 provided the procedure by which a defendant or claimant might have intervened in a garnishment proceeding, but it was expressly provided in O.G.C.A. &sect; 46-401 that a garnishment proceeding was an action between the garnisher and garnishee, and there was no provision for notice to the judgment defendant. The post-judgment garnishment procedure as set forth in the 1976 Act, O.G.C.A. &sect;&sect; 46-102, 46-103 failed to meet the requirements of judicial supervision and notice, and was therefore constitutionally inadequate.</SPAN></P>

The court found the trial judge properly charged the jury as to the required corroboration of a co-defendant's testimony.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The member was an incumbent on the board of education and brought an action against the board of elections alleging that he was elected for a six year term. The board contended that his term was for four years. The trial court ruled in favor of the board and the member appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The decisive issue was whether Ga. Const. art. VIII, &sect; V, para. II, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-6802, was permissive or mandatory as it related to the requirement that local laws affecting school boards be approved by referendum, since the act changing the term of office from six years to four years was not approved by referendum. The court held that the provision was permissive. The word &quot;notwithstanding&quot; in the provision meant that the provision was not the exclusive method for effecting changes in school board terms. The word &quot;may&quot; in the provision was construed as permissive. Therefore, the court held that the natural and ordinary meaning of the provision was to provide several procedures for effecting changes in local school boards. Legislative action taken after the provision was approved showed that the permissive reading was correct.</SPAN></P>

According to the court, the instruction was on the issue of guilt or innocence and was no longer an issue at the sentence determination stage of the proceedings. The court determined that the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on the burden of proof of an insanity defense. The court also determined that the trial court did not err in sentencing defendant to death based on the jury repeating the relevant portion of the presentence charge practically verbatim. The court found that the trial court properly allowed a tape recording to be played because a proper foundation was laid. The court held that the prosecution did not improperly comment on defendant's failure to testify.

Laws 2166, &sect; 10 for want of prosecution. The client contended that 1960 Ga.

The court first held that the client's notice of appeal was timely filed because the denial of the motion to vacate was predicated upon a non-amendable defect and was an appealable order. The court held that the client was entitled to have the order set aside because the trial court dismissal of the client's action for being inactive for two years was inconsistent with the five year limitations period in &sect; 81A-141(e).

The father, who lived out of state, sought a change in the custody of his children. The mother filed suit for higher child support payments. The trial court denied the father's motion for custody and awarded the mother higher child support payments. On appeal, the court affirmed. The father was in the trial court by virtue of having filed an original action there in the nature of habeas corpus. The mother's counterclaim, in the nature of an original action permitted by the statute (O.C.G.A. &sect; 30-220), was asserted against the nonresident father in the jurisdiction in Georgia which he was required by Georgia law to use in order to assert his claim of custody against the mother. In this situation the venue for the mother's child support claim was proper. The nonresident father had voluntarily submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the trial court in order to assert his claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties were divorced, and custody of their two minor children was awarded to the mother. Pursuant to a separation agreement, incorporated into the divorce decree, the father was required to make child support payments for each of the two children. The agreement provided that the father should continue child support payments until each child died, married, became self-supporting, or became of age. When the older of the two children reached his 18th birthday, the father refused to make any more child support payments for the child on the ground that the child had become of age within the meaning of the agreement. After the agreement had been entered into and before the child turned 18, the passage of 1972 Ga. Laws 193 changed the age of majority from 21 to 18. The trial court found the father in contempt. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that an agreement providing support until a child &quot;becomes of age&quot; rendered prior to the enactment of 1972 Ga. Laws 193, meant that support payments had to continue until the child reached 21 years of age. It would have been unconstitutional for the law to have been retroactive or to have impaired contracts already entered into.</SPAN></P>

The expenditure of certain bond funds was authorized by the board to acquire the selected site. Those funds had previously been obligated by referendum for use in renovating the county incinerator.

The court also held that the board was acting within its authority in selecting a solid waste disposal site. Ga. Const. art. XI, &sect;&sect; 1 and 3.

The court held that the statutes were not unconstitutional because they provided for rational discretion and evenhanded justice in narrowing the guidelines. Defendant further contended that the death sentence should not have been imposed because no juror was opposed to the imposition of capital punishment. The court concluded that the sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a trial by jury at which defendant was found guilty on all six counts of murder, and after finding statutory aggravating circumstances as to each count, the death penalty was imposed on each count pursuant to the jury's verdict. The court held that the evidence authorized the verdicts. In particular, the testimony of a conspirator as to defendant's participation in the crimes was corroborated by testimony showing that defendant's fingerprints were on a beer can found outside the victims' home, and that defendant had on his person at the time of his arrest a pistol identified as being one of the murder weapons and a watch belonging to one of the victims. Moreover, the trial court did not err in overruling a co-defendant's motion for disqualification because O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-102 did not apply. Finally, pursuant to the mandatory review required by O.C.G.A. &sect; 27-2537(c)(1)-(3), the court held that the death sentences were not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; the statutory aggravating circumstances were supported by overwhelming evidence; and the death sentences were proportional to similar cases.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed portions of the judgment that sustained the GRFA appropriation of tax funds to the authority and to a capital reserve fund whenever it was depleted below a minimum amount. Such use was illegal as a donation or gratuity under Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; I, para. II, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-5402. State appropriations could not be used to pay the bondholders of the authority. The court affirmed the judgment sustaining the validity of the bonds. The invalid portions were severed from GRFA, which as a whole was not void. The bonds were a valid and proper exercise of the authority's mandate, with the exceptions of the severable portions. The promotion of housing for low and moderate income families and the stimulation of the housing market was a valid public purpose.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment. The trial court properly overruled defendant's motion for a change of venue because he did not show that the trial's setting was inherently prejudicial or that the jury selection process showed actual prejudice that prevented a fair trial. The trial court correctly overruled defendant's objection to the state's qualification of the jury. The improper excuse of one juror was not sufficient to bias the jury toward the death penalty. The evidence supported the denial of defendant's motion to suppress his confession. A photograph of a red liquid substance in the house where the crime occurred was relevant, material, and properly admitted. Comments by the prosecutor during closing were timely cured by the trial court's admonishment. A motion to quash that would have declared Georgia's laws on murder and the death penalty unconstitutional was properly denied. Defendant showed no prejudice resulting from the denial of pretrial discovery. He waived his challenges to the arrays of grand and traverse jurors by failing to timely raise them. The jury instructions were proper and the evidence supported the jury's finding of aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant shopping mall tenants brought an action in the Ware Superior Court (Georgia) against appellee city officials, seeking a judgment declaring 1972 Ga. Laws 2970-2972 (amended 1973) unconstitutional. They also claimed that under the Alternative Method of Extending Municipal Boundaries Act (Act), 1970 Ga. Laws 426-435, local annexation of territory was not possible. The superior court dismissed the complaint, and the tenants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under 1972 Ga. Laws 2970-2972 (amended 1973), the city annexed an area in which the tenants' shopping mall was located. The tenants were obligated by their leases to pay a portion of the ad valorem taxes, and they claimed that the lease provisions, coupled with the late effective date of 1972 Ga. Laws 2970-2972 (amended 1973), gave a tax exemption to the mall's owners. In considering the appeal, the court ruled that the legislature always had to power to extend or diminish a city's corporate limits. The Act simply gave cities an alternative way of annexing territory, which was cumulative to the existing methods. It did not take away cities' legislative authority to pass local acts annexing territory. The court also concluded that no tax exemption was involved because until the effective date of 1972 Ga. Laws 2970-2972, neither the owners nor the tenants were liable for city taxes or licenses. The court finally ruled that personal notice of the proposed annexation was not required and that under the state constitution, O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-1915, and the applicable statute,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 47-801, notice by publication was sufficient. The complaint thus failed to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted in February for the armed robbery of a convenience store, and he demanded a trial. He was brought to trial in July during the May term. A mistrial was declared; he was tried again the next week, but a second mistrial was declared. In both cases, the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Finally, in September, during the August term of court, he was found guilty in a third trial. Defendant contended he should have been tried at the term when indicted and when the demand was made, or at the next term, under Ga. Crim. Code. &sect; 27-1901. The court held that armed robbery was a capital offense and was controlled by Ga. Crim. Code &sect;&sect; 27-1901.1, 27-1901.2, rather than Ga. Crim. Code &sect; 27-1901, even though the death penalty was not sought, because armed robbery was a capital crime. The court found no denial of the U.S. Const. amend. VI right to speedy trial. The two mistrials were manifestly necessary because the juries were hung and the third trial was not double jeopardy. Testimony that the amount taken was between $ 84 and $ 100 was sufficiently specific.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer asserted that the board's proposed purchase of facilities and equipment for the production of asphalt was ultra vires. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order that denied the taxpayer temporary injunctive relief. The court held that the trial court was permitted to balance the relative conveniences of the parties, and to determine that the law and facts were so adverse to one party's position that a final order in his favor was unlikely. The held that the trial court properly concluded as a matter of law that the board had authority under the state constitution and statutes to make the purchase and that the board had not abused its discretion. The court held that the mere production of asphalt, without more, did not constitute an unconstitutional intrusion into private enterprise. The taxpayer's reliance on Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 69-202 was misplaced because it prohibited as ultra vires, the execution of contracts that were effective beyond the term of the commissioners then in office. The determining factor was whether the contract was completed within the term not whether the depreciable life of the property extended beyond the term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the parties' contract language foreclosed future modification of the alimony award. The parties' divorce agreement indicated that it was a complete and final settlement of any and all rights that either of the parties could have had against the other that could have been appropriately settled. On appeal, the court reversed. It held that the right to modification existed unless it had been clearly waived in the parties' agreement and that the wife failed to show with the contract language that modification had been waived. Therefore, the court concluded that the contract had not barred an action for statutory modification of the alimony judgment and that the dismissal was erroneous. The court found that the waiver had not occurred because the contract language had not provided in clear and unambiguous language, needing no parol explanation, that the husband waived the right to modify the award. The court determined that the contract referred to all rights that could have been settled at the time of the divorce. The court found that the contract had not referred to rights that the parties could have had or thereafter had.</SPAN></P>

Each of the prospective jurors excused made it unmistakably clear that he would vote against the death penalty regardless of what transpires at trial. Exclusion for this purpose was allowed. The court found that the jury was composed of a cross-section of the population. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in charging the jury that they could find the death penalty on both cases, using the commission of the murder as the aggravating circumstance for the rape, and using the commission of the rape as the aggravating circumstance for the murder and in its recharge to the jury and in overruling his exceptions thereto. The court found that the sentence of death for the rape offense had to be set aside and the case remanded for resentencing by the trial judge on the rape count of the indictment, based upon the record and argument of counsel because the actual imposition of two death sentences on the basis of mutually aggravating circumstances could not be upheld.</SPAN></P>

The Criminal Court of Fulton County (Georgia) sustained defendants' demurrer on the ground that the statute was unconstitutionally vague in violation of Ga. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The criminal court ruled that O.C.G.A. &sect; 79A-702(b) was too vague to inform defendants of what drugs were prohibited because the statute provided that the drugs listed on an existing list prepared by the inspector were dangerous drugs. In considering the State's appeal, the court ruled that when a statute adopted a part or all of another statute by specific and descriptive reference to it, the adoption took the statute as it existed at that time. The statute thus had adopted the list as it existed at the time. The court also ruled that under the Administrative Procedure Act, courts took judicial notice of rules promulgated by the state pharmacy board. In addition, the office of the inspector was an office within the state pharmacy board. Any act by the inspector constituted an act by the board of which the court took judicial notice. The court also noted that the state secretary published agency rules and distributed the publications. Accordingly, because the list had been published, the criminal court erred in ruling that &sect; 79A-702(b) was too vague and indefinite.</SPAN></P>

The deputy clerk issued a writ of attachment that required the sheriff to serve any summons of garnishment that might be placed in his hands. A summons of garnishment was then issued by the deputy clerk, directed to the United States as garnishee. The summons was served and the United States advised the alleged judgment debtor of the summons. The alleged judgment debtor then filed pleadings in the attachment-garnishment action. The United States answered the garnishment and paid certain funds due to the alleged judgment debtor into the registry of the trial court. The trial court dismissed plaintiff's attachment and garnishment proceeding. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The Georgia garnishment statutes failed to satisfy the requirements of procedural due process in both pre-judgment and post-judgment cases. The alleged judgment debtor, the judgment having been procured in another state, was deprived of his funds in the hands of the United States garnishee without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commissioners instructed the tax commissioner to withhold a percentage of the taxes collected for education purposes and to deposit that amount into the county treasury. The Board told the tax commissioner that the taxes had to be paid to the Board. The tax commissioner then set up an escrow account and filed an interpleader action requiring the parties to establish their claims. The Commissioners argued that O.C.G.A. &sect; 32-1106, a general act which directed the Commissioners to pay the tax commissioner's salary, conflicted with a local act, which provided that the tax commissioner was not permitted to receive fees for the collection of any taxes levied for school purposes. On appeal, the court held that there was no merit to the Commissioner's argument that the local act violated the Georgia Constitution. The court ruled that once the legislature placed the tax commissioner on a salary basis, taxes collected by him for education purposes could not have constitutionally been used for the payment of his salary or for expenses incurred in the operation of his office. The court concluded that such activities were not &quot;necessary or incidental&quot; to the maintenance of public education.</SPAN></P>

The tapes of the communications obtained under the intercept order were transcribed and delivered to the clerk of the court. Affirming, the court concluded that the wiretaps were proper. The telephone intercept order sought for defendants' telephone was in compliance with the requirements of 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2518(1)(c), (3)(c). The purpose of the section was to require the affiant to show the difficulties in using conventional techniques before resorting to an intercept order. The tapes were handled confidentially and in compliance with the trial court's orders. The court concluded that because the trial court was informed of previous telephone intercept orders, it was harmless error to fail to advise him of one incident. The court found that O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-3004 was constitutional because it was not required to contain the provision of the federal statute,&nbsp;18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2518(6), authorizing reports to the issuing judge.</SPAN></P>

The court found no conflict in those code sections in that Ga.

The State appealed after the Superior Court of Clayton County (Georgia) granted the driver's motion to dismiss and held that the Act was unconstitutional as retroactively applied to the driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State sought to revoke the driver's license based upon conduct that occurred prior to the Act's effective date.

In reversing, the court held that the right to operate a motor vehicle upon the public highways of Georgia was a qualified right. The proceeding to revoke the driver's license under the Act was not a criminal proceeding, but was solely designed to determine whether the driver was a menace on the highways due to his past driving record. The only due process rights that attached were procedural ones. The legislature had the power to repeal, alter, or modify state laws enacted for the protection of the public without violating the prohibition against retroactive statutes. The Act did not violate the driver's equal protection rights because there was a rational basis for allowing his past record as an habitual offender to be considered and it equally affected all similarly situated persons.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that &sect; 27-2534.1(b)(1) did not provide sufficiently &quot;clear and objective standards&quot; necessary to control the jury's discretion in imposing the death penalty. The court determined that defendant's asserted errors as to the conviction were without merit because: (1) the accomplice testimony was independently corroborated; (2) testimony concerning a conversation between police and a witness was too nonspecific to be considered a reflection of defendant's character; and (3) it was not error to exclude veniremen who were questioned as a group about their opinions on the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that as a general rule, equity would not take part in the administration of the criminal law by restraining or obstructing criminal courts.

Taxpayers asserted claims against tax appraisal company for breach of its contract with the county and for damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 based on the alleged unconstitutionality of several statutes dealing with the tax and the inaccuracy of the digest prepared by tax appraisal company. The trial court granted tax appraisal company's motion for summary judgment and taxpayers sought review. In affirming the decision, the court held that taxpayers did not have standing to pursue their claim for breach of contract under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 81A-123(a)(1) because there was no substantive law that granted them a secondary right to sue a third party for breach of its contract with the county. The court also found that taxpayers were not third party beneficiaries of the contract.

The court determined that the warnings given to defendant prior to his confession fully complied with Miranda. The court determined that the trial court's resolution of the conflict in the evidence in favor of the admissibility of the confession was supported by a preponderance of the evidence. The court also found that no objection was made to the additional remarks of the district attorney during his final argument on the guilt or innocence phase of the trial and thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial. The court concluded that the sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and the evidence supported the jury's finding of statutory aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The trial court returned a verdict in favor of appellees. The court noted that the 1902 Act, Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 85-1307, 85-1308, 85-1309, which fixed and prescribed the boundaries of land adjacent to, covered by, or bordering on the tide-waters, had been in effect since its enactment, had not been held to be unconstitutional, and was effective, Thus, the constitutional ratification in 1945 of the 1902 Act immunized the 1902 Act from a later successful constitutional attack. The court determined that the oystermen had the exclusive right to the oysters in the tidal waters next to their adjacent land. The court concluded that the state had fee simple title to the foreshore in all navigable tide-waters. The court noted that gradual accretions of land from navigable tide-waters accrued to the adjacent land owner.

On appeal, the injured motorist contended that Georgia law of agency, from which the family car doctrine arose, provided that an agent could not delegate his authority to another unless he was specifically empowered to do so. The court affirmed the judgment and held that: (1) the liability created by the family car doctrine was applicable notwithstanding the fact that the owner expressly instructed the family member not to permit third persons to drive the car; and (2) once the owner consented to the use of the vehicle for a family purpose and relinquished control of the car to a family member for that purpose, the requirements of due process were satisfied.</SPAN></P>

Appellant State Commissioner of Revenue also sought review, challenging the trial court's order granting the taxpayers' request for an order restraining the collection of the state's tax levy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers filed an action against the county and the Commissioner, alleging that the assessed value of their properties was arbitrarily changed and that the ad valorem tax digest was the result of an illegal and non-uniform plan to increase tax assessments in the county. The trial court ruled in favor of the county on the tax digest issue, but issued an order restraining the collection of the state's tax levy. Both sides appealed. The court rejected the argument that the definition of fair market value in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 92-542 (1972) was too vague and indefinite to be enforced. The court found that &sect; 92-7001 required the Commissioner to examine the tax digests and to require adjustment in order to equalize property values. The court held, however, that it was not error for the trial court to hold that the tax digest was not invalid for the Commissioner's failure to equalize classes of property, stating that an objection to the exercise of the Commissioner's discretion in equalizing the digests should come from the county, not individual taxpayers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife filed an application in probate court for a year of support from her husband's estate, served notice on the devisee by publication, and was awarded a half interest in the devisee's property. The wife then filed an action in the trial court against the devisee for partitioning. The trial court granted the devisee's motion for summary judgment, holding that the year's support judgment amounted to a taking of the devisee's property without adequate notice and was a violation of the Due Process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Georgia Constitution. The court agreed and affirmed the judgment below, holding that although the devisee's interest in the real estate was inchoate and did not vest until assent by an executor, it was a legal right that was protected. The court then held that the year's support proceeding which allowed a final judgment to be obtained by a widow awarding her property in an unrepresented estate on notice only by publication, as here, to persons with a legally protected interest in the property was unconstitutional. Due process required that all interested persons who were known or easily ascertainable received actual notice by mail.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for involuntary manslaughter after he caused the death of two individuals by operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and drugs. A Superior Court of Bibb County (Georgia) quashed and dismissed the indictment on five grounds of demurrer filed by defendant, and the State appealed from the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the demurrers sustained by the trial court, defendant argued that O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-1103(a) was unconstitutional. Section 26-1103(a) provided that a person committed involuntary manslaughter when he caused the death of another without intent by committing an unlawful act other than a felony. On review, the State argued that O.C.G.A. &sect; 68A-903(b) was unconstitutional because it classified homicides by vehicle resulting from reckless driving differently from other homicides in the commission of unlawful acts. The court held that neither O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-1103(a) nor O.C.G.A. &sect; 68A-903(b) were unconstitutional for any reason urged by the State or defendant. The court reasoned that the legislature was authorized to find that the crime of involuntary manslaughter in the commission of an unlawful act other than a felony differed from a homicide by vehicle. Nonetheless, although the trial court correctly concluded that defendant could not be tried for the offense of involuntary manslaughter under O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-1103(a), the court concluded that the judgment quashing the indictment should be reversed because the indictment charged the offense of homicide by vehicle in the second degree.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers contended that the method of ad valorem taxation set forth in Ga.

On appeal, the court held that the taxpayers failed to state a claim for equitable or declaratory relief against the county officials and that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the commissioner, who was not a resident of the county in which the action was filed. The court ruled that the county boards of equalization had ample authority to remedy deficiencies in the uniformity of assessments, that Ga.

State, 221 Ga. 866, 148 S.E. 2d 305 (1966), the court found that the sole purpose of a commitment hearing was simply to determine whether there was probable cause and to bind defendant over to the grand jury. A preliminary hearing was not a required step in a felony prosecution and once an indictment was obtained, there would be no judicial oversight or review of the decision to prosecute because of any failure to hold a commitment hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 92-6912 created boards of equalization in all counties. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court ruled that the statute made a broad grant of authority to county boards of tax equalization to fashion remedies that were directed to the particular defects of a digest and that were best suited to the achievement of uniformity in a county's tax assessments. The statute also provided for ample notice and a hearing and for an appeal to the superior court. The court thus held that &sect; 92-6913 did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Georgia or Federal Constitutions. Because the statute was applicable to all properties assessed within a county by the board of assessors and all owners thereof, it did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The court also ruled that the appointment of members of the boards of equalization by the grand jury of each county was not offensive to the Georgia or Federal Constitutions.

Code Ann. &sect; 58-706.1, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the commissioner filed a motion to dismiss the wholesalers' action to declare the Act unconstitutional, the wholesalers dismissed the commissioner as a defendant. When the trial court then found the Act unconstitutional, the state, attorney general, and commissioner appealed. The wholesalers claimed that the dismissal estopped the commissioner's appeal. The court dismissed: 1) the state's appeal because they were never a party; and 2) the attorney general's appeal because Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 110-1106 only allowed the attorney general to represent the commissioner in the cause. The court held that because Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 81A-123(a) did not allow the voluntary dismissal of less than all defendants in a class action without the trial court's approval, the dismissal did not bar the appeal. Because the trial court's judgment impaired the commissioner's duties, he had standing to appeal. The court reversed the judgment and found the Act constitutional. There was a rational basis for the tax. Ga. Const. art. XV, &sect; 1, para. 1 and Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-8301 did not limit the legislature's ability to pass the Act because those enactments only allowed the delegation of authority to cities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed a judgment from the Richmond Superior Court (Georgia) that convicted them of drug-related crimes. The trial court overruled defendants' demurrer to the indictment and denied their motion to suppress evidence obtained by the use of a search warrant, which defendants claimed was issued in violation of 1974 Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A justice of the peace issued a search warrant under which evidence that incriminated defendants was seized. Defendants claimed that the justice of the peace was without authority to issue the warrant because &sect; 14, which a section of special legislation that created the civil court of the forum county, ousted the jurisdiction of justices of the peace to sit as a court of inquiry. The trial court sustained several arguments by the State in support of its claim that &sect; 14 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court rejected all but one of the State's attacks on the constitutionality of &sect; 14 and ruled that &sect; 14 violated the constitutional provision, Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; VII, para. I, O.C.G.A. &sect; . &sect; 2-4201, that authorized the creation of courts in lieu of justice courts. Section 2-4201 authorized the abolishment of justices of the peace in either a city or a county, but did not give any authority for the enactment of a special law that deprived them of a portion of their jurisdiction in either a city or a county. Such a change in the statutory jurisdiction of the justice courts could only be effected by a general law. The justice of the peace thus had authority to issue the warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The general assembly enacted an appropriations act that was approved by the governor.

The Regents announced that the faculty members would not be paid the salary increases, and the faculty members filed a declaratory judgment action. The trial court ruled in favor of the faculty members on all counts. On appeal, the court reversed in part the judgment, dismissing the claims against the governor and other state officials based on sovereign immunity. It affirmed in part the judgment, ruling that the Regents did not have sovereign immunity, and the faculty employment contracts were valid and binding upon the Regents. The court reversed in part the judgment against the Regents, reasoning that until the possibilities for paying the salaries had been exhausted, the amended appropriations act was not subject to constitutional attack on grounds of impairment under Ga.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The materialman filed its complaint to foreclose its materialman's lien against the owners of the property on which materials furnished by the materialman were used. The complaint alleged that the contractors who had contracted with the materialman for the materials had been adjudicated as bankrupts. The owners filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 67-2001, 67-2002, as amended, which permitted the filing of a materialman's lien without notice or opportunity for a hearing at any meaningful time or in any meaningful manner, constituted the taking of a significant property interest without due process of law. The trial court granted the motion, and the materialman appealed. The court reversed the judgment because the Georgia materialmen's lien statutes did not deprive property owners of a significant property interest without notice and hearing, and they served an important public interest of protecting the interest of the materialman from subsequent purchasers of the property. The statutes provided notice, and the owners could remove the liens by filing of an appropriate bond.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the playing of a taped confession taken during a custodial interrogation without the benefit of the full Miranda warnings constituted reversible constitutional error. The court determined that the trial court did not err in ruling that the Miranda warnings were given to defendant as required by law because such evidence was presented at trial, even though it was not presented at the Jackson v Denno hearing. The court also found that defendant was not &quot;drunk&quot; at the time the Miranda warnings were giving and that he was capable of understanding what was said to him. The court further concluded that a 30 hour period between the warnings and the taping did not render the confession inadmissible. Defendant argued that the charge to the jury that no inference could be drawn from defendant's failure to testify constituted a comment by the judge on defendant's silence. The court held that the charge to the jury did not violate the Fifth Amendment and was, in fact, beneficial to defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because defendant's arrest was lawful, the trial court properly denied his motion to suppress physical evidence. Defendant was arrested on the day of the murder when he was taken to the sheriff's office for questioning. The officers had probable cause to arrest defendant because at that time they knew he had borrowed his brother's car that morning, the car's tire tracks matched those in the victim's driveway, defendant owned boots capable of making the mud tracks in the victim's house, and defendant's whereabouts during the murder were unaccounted for.</SPAN></P>

It was not error to fail to charge that the burden was on the State on the question of entrapment. There was no error in the trial court overruling defendant's special demurrer to the indictment. The language in the indictment charged defendant with the possession of marijuana and could not have been more specific. The instruction regarding intent was adequate. Finally, O.C.G.A. &sect; 79A-811(j) was not unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Cobb County Board of Commissioners challenged a decision from the Cobb County Superior Court (Georgia), which entered judgment for appellee landowner in his suit alleging that the decision by the Board to deny the landowner's application for rezoning was an unconstitutional taking of private property. The Board alleged that a zoning decision was a legislative function generally not subject to review by the courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property was originally zoned for single family housing. The landowner sought to rezone the property for commercial development. The bulk of the evidence was that the highest and best use of the land was commercial. The majority of surrounding landowners supported the rezoning. The appellate court affirmed. While zoning was quasi-judicial, it was subject to the constitutional prohibition against the taking of private property without just compensation. A zoning decision had to bear a substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare. Balancing the competing interests, if there was little gain to the public but serious injury to the landowner, the zoning decision was confiscatory. Property did not have to be rendered totally useless for an unlawful confiscation to occur. There was no countervailing benefit to the public by the refusal to rezone. The appellate court was not required to accept the Board's construction of what was in the community's interests if done in good faith.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the superior court ordering the Board to reclassify the property consistent with the owner's constitutional rights was affirmed. The Board's refusal to rezone the property as commercial resulted in substantial hardship to the landowner without a gain to the public benefit. It was not required that the property be rendered totally useless to find an unconstitutional regulatory taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant prisoner claimed that the Act was unconstitutional because it violated Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, para. 4 (1945), which provided that no person should be deprived of the right to prosecute or to defend his own cause in any of the Georgia courts, in person, by attorney, or both, pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-104. The court stated that the prisoner was not denied his right to prosecute his cause in the habeas corpus court. The questions raised in the case dealt only with &sect; 3 of the Act about appeals from the habeas corpus court. The Act, providing that the court might have refused to entertain a habeas corpus appeal for lack of probable cause, was not unconstitutional. The Act's provision, which provided that a justice could grant or deny the application of probable cause for appeal, was unconstitutional. But, this did not render the entire Act unconstitutional. The unconstitutional portion of the Act was not so connected with the general scope of the statute that the legislative intent could not be accomplished. Giving appellee warden a right to appeal and giving the prisoner the right to appeal upon a showing of probable cause was not a denial of equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested in connection with the murder and armed robbery of a filling station operator. The evidence at trial tended to show that shortly after witnesses saw defendant and her companion running from the station the decedent's body was found 18 inches from an open safe. It was subsequently determined that a .22 caliber bullet killed the decedent. Police officers found $ 400 and an empty .22 caliber shell in defendant's purse when she was apprehended. A jury found defendant guilty of murder and armed robbery. The court noted that O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 59-112, -124 did not automatically exclude women from jury service. As there was no evidence of the composition of the grand and traverse juries, the constitutional attack on &sect;&sect; 59-112, -124 was without merit. Further, as the medical examiner testified at trial, it could not be said that the denial of the autopsy report so impaired defendant's defense that she was denied a fair trial. Moreover, the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to corroborate the confession of murder and armed robbery. Finally, the identification of the $ 400 that was found in defendant's purse was a matter addressed peculiarly and solely to the jury.</SPAN></P>

The special master did not submit findings of fact. The condemnee made timely exceptions and appealed to the trial court, which, after a hearing, ordered absolute title in and to said easement to vest in the utility. On appeal, the court affirmed, noting that the condemnation procedure provided by Ga.

Further, at the hearing before the special master, the condemnor presented sufficient evidence of the necessity for the transmission line and of the care exercised by the condemnor in the selection of the property to be taken.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted on charges of murder with malice aforethought, felony murder, and armed robbery. Testimony at trial tended to establish that defendant and his accomplices planned to rob a convenience store where a housemate worked. The housemate testified that defendant knocked the victim down and shot him in the temple. A jury found defendant guilty as charged. The court held that defendant's motion for a new trial was properly overruled because, at the time of testifying, the housemate's testimony was not false because she had not been promised that she would get a three-year sentence if she testified for the prosecution. Further, the trial court was not required to charge, without request, that the testimony of an accomplice should be received with caution because O.C.G.A. &sect; 38-121 required corroboration of accomplice testimony in felony cases. Moreover, O.C.G.A. &sect; 27-2206 prohibited defense counsel from referring to parole in the context of serving a full sentence, and defendant could not obtain a new trial based on such argument after an unfavorable verdict.

The court held that direct evidence such as the prosecutrix's identification of defendant was sufficient to link defendant to the crime pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 38-102 because it pointed to the question at issue. Also, the trial court properly overruled defendant's objections to the prosecutrix's reference to defendant on cross-examination as being a known peeping tom. The answers by the prosecutrix were responsive to questions propounded by defense counsel or were explanations of answers already made. Also, defense counsel actually asked the prosecutrix if she knew defendant to be a peeping tom, which was substantially the same. Further, Ga. Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers filed a class action complaint alleging that the state revenue commissioner approved the 1973 county tax digest in violation of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 92-8407.1 after the county implemented a complete re-appraisal and five percent of the property owners appealed. Further, the complaint alleged that the county did not apply the same standards, measures, or methods of valuations to all property within the county in arriving at the fair market value which resulted in a lack of uniformity and that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 92-7001 was unconstitutional in that it provided no method for appeal. The trial court declared the tax digest invalid and enjoined the collection of the taxes. The court reversed and held that the county, pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 92-6912(5)(A), (4)(B), had full authority to fashion an adequate and appropriate legal remedy to redress all of the taxpayers' grievances regarding the valuation of individual parcels of land and the uniformity of the county tax assessments. Therefore, it was not necessary for the trial court to exercise its equitable jurisdiction to hear and decide the issues presented by the taxpayers' complaint.</SPAN></P>

After defendant's convictions were affirmed on direct appeal, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court denied the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of habeas relief to defendant. Under caselaw precedent, the denial of a preliminary hearing was not a valid ground for habeas corpus relief. Moreover, there was no evidence that indicated defendant ever requested, and was actually denied, a preliminary hearing. Although the person who allegedly purchased heroin from defendant was a material witness, defendant was not denied his right to confront his accuser based on the State's failure to call the buyer as a witness because his identity was revealed to defendant and the State was precluded from introducing the buyer's statements into evidence. The crime of illegal possession was not included in the crime of illegal sale. Defendant failed to show that he was aggrieved by an illegal search and seizure. Thus, he did not carry his burden of proving that he did not receive effective assistance of counsel due to his counsel's failure to file a motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court reversed. It found that, under Ga. Const. art. IV, &sect; V, para. I and Ga. Code Ann. &sect;53-502, the wife could be held liable for the debts of her husband. The amendment to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 53-503 did not violate the due process and equal protection provisions of the Georgia and United States Constitutions because there was a rational basis for a distinction between married women whose separate estates consisted of real and/or intangible personal property and those whose estates consisted of tangible personal property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was convicted of drowning his stepson, defendant argued that the Georgia death penalty was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment convicting and sentencing defendant for murder. Specifically, the court first noted that since defendant had not been sentenced to death, he had no standing to object to the constitutionality of the death penalty. Similarly, the court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for a mistrial on the basis of the trial court's remarks to a juror regarding the death penalty. Instead, the court noted that the trial court made no comment expressing an opinion as to defendant's guilt or innocence. Next, the court held that a district attorney's opening statement had not been improper and that defendant had not been entitled to a new trial or a directed verdict of acquittal. Lastly, the court determined that the trial court's charge to the jury was correct and complete since it made it clear that the burden was on the State to prove defendant's guilt and since it let the jury decide whether a statement by defendant had been a confession or an admission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife initiated divorce proceedings against the husband, alleging cruel treatment. The husband defended the action with evidence that the wife had committed adultery. The court affirmed the trial court's order. In so ruling, the court ruled that the award of child support was not excessive. The court noted that the evidence established that the wife's income, alone, was insufficient to meet the child's necessary expenses. Moreover, the court found that, while the husband was unemployed, he was in good health and capable of earning a living. The court concluded that the husband's temporary unemployment did not preclude a child support award. The court also rejected the husband's argument that the wife was not entitled to alimony because she committed adultery. While the court noted that the record did support a finding that the wife had engaged in one incident of adultery after the couple was separated, the court emphasized that the record also established that the husband had committed adultery. As such, the wife was not precluded from receiving alimony. Finally, the court found that state statutes providing for alimony for wives and not for husbands were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant brought a habeas corpus action based upon a judgment of the Tattnall Superior Court (Georgia), which convicted him of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Appellant's sole defense was insanity. He claimed that the trial judge's instructions on insanity violated his constitutional rights by shifting to him the burden of proof on an essential element of the offense and by relieving the prosecution of its burden of proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court charged the jury that every person was presumed to be of sound mind but that the presumption was rebuttable and that the acts of such a person were presumed to be the product of that person's will, but this presumption was also rebuttable. The jury was charged that the burden was upon appellant to establish the defense, not beyond a reasonable doubt, but to the reasonable satisfaction of the jury. The court held that the trial court's charge to the jury was not violative of due process. Although the State clearly had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt all critical essential elements of the murder charge against appellant, sanity was not a critical essential element of the offense that the State was required to prove. Moreover, there was no constitutional requirement that the State shoulder the burden of proving appellant's sanity. Once the State met the rigorous burden of proving that appellant not only killed the victim but did it with malice aforethought, the court reasoned that it was appropriate that appellant who sought to establish the defense of insanity, in order to escape any punishment, would bear burden on such an issue.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 3, &sect;1, para. 1 (1945) by delegating to the state board of pharmacy the authority to determine what acts would constitute a crime without providing the board any real guidelines to follow when making that determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee was a 17-year-old high school student.

Appellee's motion to suppress the evidence was denied by the trial court and appellee was convicted of misdemeanor possession of marihuana. The lower appellate court reversed, ruling that the principal was a government agent, thus the search violated appellee's U.S. Const. amend. IV rights. The court reversed, reinstating the conviction, holding that primary and secondary school students did not have the same right to be free from searches as adults.

Defendant went to the victims' home, robbed and tied up the husband, raped and kidnapped the wife, and took the victims' car. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court found that the trial court did not err in joining all charges for trial because the offenses were all part of one continuous transaction. The court found no error in the trial court's admission of opinion evidence as the police officer's testimony regarding the defendant's mental condition was based upon facts given in the testimony. The court determined that the finding that defendant was competent to stand trial was not against the manifest weight of the evidence and that the jury's verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court held that defendant's statutory right to cross-examine the prosecution's witnesses did not include the right to be argumentative with a prosecution witness.

The deceased employee also had six stepchildren under the age of 18 from his then-current wife, but he provided no support for such children. The natural children filed a workmen's compensation claim. On motion by the employer, the deceased's widow and his stepchildren were made parties. Prior to a decision from the Board, the natural children filed an action for a declaratory judgment that &sect; 114-414 was unconstitutional and for injunction restraining the Board from entering an award based thereon. The trial court ruled in favor of the natural children, declaring the presumption of dependency by stepchildren under &sect; 114-414 unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the natural children's petition for an injunction should have been denied on the ground that they had an adequate administrative remedy at law. Also, the petition for declaratory judgment should have been denied on the ground that the rights of the parties already accrued and were being adjudicated by the Board.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the affidavit of illegality upon a jury verdict sustaining the tax levy, which had been imposed for failure to collect unemployment compensation taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state determined that a corporation had failed to collect unemployment compensation taxes and because the corporation had no assets within the state, the state's employment security agency imposed a tax levy on personal property of the corporation's COO. The COO subsequently filed an affidavit of illegality to challenge the constitutionality of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 54-650.2, the statute under which the levy was imposed. Upon a jury verdict sustaining the levy, the trial court dismissed the affidavit of illegality. On appeal, the court rejected the argument that &sect; 54-650.2 was unconstitutionally vague and held that, under a reasonable construction of the Employment Security Act, &sect; 54-650.2 fixed personal liability for the tax on the officer or employee who had the duty to pay the tax or who was responsible for the employer's failure to pay. The court determined, nevertheless, that the trial court committed reversible error in charging the jury with the definition of &quot;employer.&quot; Accordingly, the court remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ruled in favor of the COO, in part; held that the trial court had erred in its charge to the jury; and thus, reversed the dismissal of the affidavit of illegality and remanded the case for a new trial. The court, nevertheless, also ruled in favor of the state, in part; and affirmed the trial court's ruling that the state law imposing personal liability for the failure to collect the tax was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The litigant applied to the board for a beer and wine license to be used at his place of business. The litigant's business was less than 1,700 feet from a church.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The litigant alleged that he had been denied the license on the basis of an ordinance that stated no license was to be issued where an entrance to a place of business for the retail or wholesale of beer and wine was located within 1,700 feet from the entrance or main structure of any school or any church. The litigant argued the ordinance was unreasonable and arbitrary. The complaint requested that the ordinance be declared void and that the board be required to issue the litigant a license for the sale of beer and wine at retail. After a hearing, the trial court ruled that the ordinance was constitutional and reasonable and dismissed the complaint. The litigant's contention was that the 1,700 foot restriction in the ordinance was in conflict with O.C.G.A &sect; 58-724.1, a general law. The court found no general statute that established regulatory distances for the sale of beer and wine with respect to churches. Therefore, that part of the ordinance relating to churches was not in conflict with any general law. The court held that &sect; 58-724.1 established only a &quot;minimum distance&quot; for the retail sale of wine and beer from a school. The court held the ordinance was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the evidence supported the trial judge's finding of the statutory aggravating circumstances in that the murder was committed during the commission of an aggravated battery and an armed robbery. The court also held that the death penalty statute gave the trial judge the authority to impose the death sentence without the intervention of a jury because defendant pleaded guilty.

Laws 1447, as well as two related taxing ordinances of appellee county. The trial court upheld the act and the ordinances with the exception of grandfather clauses contained in the act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county adopted an ordinance levying a tax upon the delivery by wholesalers of beer to retailers. The beer retailer contested the legality of the ordinance. Subsequently, the Uniform Beer Tax Act, 1974 Ga. Laws 1447, was passed imposing an excise tax upon the sale of beer in municipalities and counties. The county conformed its ordinance to the 1974 act and the beer retailer amended his complaint to challenge the constitutionality of the 1974 act and the amended ordinance. The trial court upheld the act and the ordinance except for the act's grandfather clauses. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision in part and reversed it in part. The court held that: (1) the initial county tax was not a license fee or tax imposed as a condition precedent to engaging in business but was a tax upon wholesale purchases of beer and as such was beyond the county's authority to impose; (2) the 1974 act did not violate uniformity requirements because it directed that taxes be imposed by the county on sales within its unincorporated areas and by municipalities on sales within their boundaries; and (3) the trial court did not err in finding the grandfather clauses unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's decision insofar as it upheld the 1974 act and declared the grandfather clauses unconstitutional. The court reversed the trial court's decision insofar as it found the initial county tax lawful. The court held the initial county tax was beyond the county's authority to impose.</SPAN></P>

In reversing the lower court's grant of summary judgment for the attorney, the court ruled that questions of fact existed as to whether the attorney's equal protection rights were violated when retirement payments to other employees were increased and his were not. Although the court ruled that the General Assembly was without the power to enact the amendments to the Act because the sole authority for the compensation of county employees rested with the county governing authorities, payments under the Act could still be authorized under home rule. Questions of fact also existed as to whether home rule applied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, tax commissioner and board of commissioners, appealed a judgment of the Newton Superior Court (Georgia), which enjoined the tax commissioner from collecting ad valorem taxes until the recommendation of plaintiff county board of education as to the rate of millage to be levied for schools was made by the board of commissioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board of education recommended a maximum 20-mill levy under an adjusted county tax digest to produce a certain revenue for the schools. After the state revenue commissioner adjusted and approved the tax digest, the board of education certified its 20-mill levy recommendation. The commissioners levied 16 mills. On the education board's petition, the trial court temporarily restrained the tax commissioner from preparing bills and collecting taxes. The trial court declared judgment for the education board, continued the restraining order, and entered findings and conclusions in the education board's favor. The court affirmed on appeal. The court declared the levy unconstitutional because the education board had the constitutional authority to fix the rate of school taxation, and held that the board of education had the legal right to establish a millage rate to produce revenue for the schools based upon a tax digest finally approved by the state revenue commissioner. The trial court properly permitted an amendment to the complaint, maintained the status quo by continuing the restraining order, and overruled defensive motions regarding notice, certification, and service of process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the board of education in its action against the tax commissioner and the board of commissioners because the power and authority to fix the rate of school taxation was vested in the board of education.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and a co-defendant were indicted for murder. The co-defendant entered a plea of guilty to voluntary manslaughter in return for a 15-year sentence. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to death. On review, defendant alleged a number of errors, including that the trial court erred by admitting certain testimony from the examiner who administered a polygraph exam to defendant. According to the court, the credibility of defendant was a vital issue in this case because his guilt or innocence primarily depended on whether the jury believed his testimony or that of his alleged accomplice. The jury learned that both defendants were given polygraph tests. They were not allowed to hear the results of such tests. According to the court, the jury might well have inferred that since the co-defendant was allowed to enter a plea of voluntary manslaughter and receive a 15-year sentence while the State was demanding the death penalty for defendant, that the co-defendant had passed his lie detector test while defendant had miserably failed his. The court therefore concluded that the evidence could not be said to have been unmistakably unprejudicial, and therefore was erroneously admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bona fide purchaser brought a cause of action against the subsequent purchaser after the subsequent purchaser bought the property owned by the bona fide purchaser. Initially, the bona fide purchaser had bought the property with an outstanding deed to secure a debt. The lender refused to accept payment from the bona fide purchase or provide her with the pay off information. Accordingly, the lender sold the property. The bona fide purchaser sought to have the sale set aside and was granted a temporary injunction enjoining any proceedings on the subsequent purchaser's dispossessory warrant action. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court because the complaint to set aside the sale pre-dated the dispossessory warrant proceedings initiated by the subsequent purchaser. Accordingly, the court held that pursuant to the Civil Practice Act, Ga. Code Ann &sect; 81A-113(a), the subsequent purchaser was required to raise the issue of right of possession in this litigation and could not raise it later in other litigation between the parties. The court noted that the refusal of the lender to accept payment was comparable to a grantee absenting himself so that no tender could be made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The school submitted an application to the commission for approval of its 24-hour course, which consisted of three eight-hour days of instruction. The commission denied the application, finding that the course did not comply with the commission's rule, which provided that for a 24-hour course, there could only be three or less hours of classroom study per day. The school brought suit, alleging that the commission had no authority to adopt its rules and that the commission's action was arbitrary and capricious. The trial court enjoined the commission until further order. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment, holding that the commission's rule was authorized by law. The court applied a two-part test to determine the validity of the commission's rule. The court first determined that the rule was authorized by statute. Under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 84-1405(d), the commission was authorized to pass rules relating to the administration of its approval of real estate courses. The court held that the rule was reasonable because the evidence supporting the distributed learning method set forth in the rules indicated that the adoption of the rule was not arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with and convicted for selling marijuana to an undercover police officer. On appeal, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, the adequacy of the chain of possession of the evidence, and the trial court's failure to instruct the jury that their verdict needed to be unanimous, without a request for that instruction. He also raised a fair cross section challenge to the jury venire based on gender disqualification. The court upheld the conviction. The prosecution proved the chain of possession and the evidence authorized the verdict. In the absence of a written request, there was no harmful error in the failure to instruct the jury that their verdict had to be unanimous. The contention that O.C.G.A. &sect; 59-112(d) (1967), which permitted any woman to request that her name not be placed in a jury box, was unconstitutional lacked merit because gender exclusion was not automatic. Finally, based on the record, the local jury selection procedures had not resulted in an unconstitutionally composed grand or traverse jury.</SPAN></P>

The injunction enjoined the enforcement of an act entitled, &quot;The Common Day of Rest Act of 1974&quot; (act). Appellee corporation had filed the original complaint to have the act declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Georgia's act was found at 1974 Ga. Laws 186. The company wanted to have the act declared unconstitutional. The act prohibited certain activities between midnight on Friday through midnight on Sunday. In reality, the act prohibited only &quot;sales&quot; on both Saturday and Sunday by certain businesses, although other business activities during that time were permitted. The court found that the act was patently discriminatory. The court then had to decide whether the act, as a whole, had to fail or whether the severability clause included could preserve those portions of the act that were not discriminatory. The court decided that only those portions that arbitrarily required certain businesses to close on one of the two days were unconstitutional. Therefore, the court affirmed the permanent injunction against enforcement of the unconstitutional provisions of the act, but reversed the permanent injunction against enforcement of the provisions of the act that were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

After he entered a guilty plea and was convicted on both charges, the trial court found aggravating circumstances and imposed the death sentence. On mandatory review, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the death penalty statute, O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 26-2001, 27-2534 et seq., was not unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection. The court stated that, although the statute provided for some discretion in the imposition of the death penalty, it was not arbitrary or unguided discretion that did not produce evenhanded justice. The court found that the armed robbery charge was properly considered an aggravating circumstance in the imposition of the sentence, even though the victim was not conscious or alive at the time of the robbery. The force or intimidation essential to the robbery had to either precede or be contemporaneous with the taking. The court noted that, without the force used by defendant, the taking from the victim could not have been accomplished. That he died from the force used either immediately or subsequently to the taking did not make the offense any less a robbery.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the death could not be carried out if the jury was chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction. Such veniremen could not be excluded unless they were unmistakably clear that they would vote against the death penalty regardless of what transpired at trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court declared members of the legislature ineligible to serve on the governing body of the authority. The Act provided that the governing body of the authority would consist of 20 members, six of whom would be legislators. The question was whether the Act, because it placed legislative members on the governing body of the authority, violated separation of powers. Appellants contended that the authority was a special instrumentality of government outside of the three traditional branches and that it performed &quot;proprietary,&quot; not &quot;governmental,&quot; functions. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that members of the governing board performed executive rather than legislative functions. The separation of powers principle was sufficiently flexible to permit practical arrangements in a complex government, but it was plain that the functions performed by the authority were primarily, if not exclusively, executive. The Act's provisions pertaining to membership of legislators on the governing board of the authority were unconstitutional. The court found that the provisions held to be unconstitutional and stricken from the Act did not render the entire Act unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An agent of the creditor made an affidavit before the trial court in order to secure the issuance of an attachment against the real and personal property of the debtor in accordance with Ga.

In the attached affidavit it was alleged that the debtor was actually removing himself without the limits of the county and absconding and concealing himself for the purpose of avoiding payment of the indebtedness. The trial court issued the writ of attachment. The debtor filed a motion to dismiss the attachment on the ground that &sect; 8-602 only provided for notice subsequent to the issuance of the attachment and without affording him an opportunity to be heard before the property was seized, thereby denying him due process under the state and federal constitutions. The court affirmed and determined that the attachment in this case had not violated the debtor's due process rights. The court found that this case presented unusual conditions or extraordinary situations due to the debtor's removing and concealing himself for the purpose of avoiding payment of the debt and that the deponent had personal knowledge of the facts and knew them to be true.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a county tax commissioner and other officials, excepted from the judgment of the Superior Court of Gwinnett County (Georgia) that enjoined them from collecting ad valorem taxes assessed against the inventory in appellee foreign corporation's warehouse, following a ruling that the assessments were void and violative of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation was a New York company and it was an importer and wholesaler of tires and tubes. The warehouse inventory that was taxed was composed mainly of imports from foreign countries, but it included some domestic tubes. The imports were received in over-the-road trailers and sea vans. The tires were received in bulk and commingled with other shipments, while the tubes were individually packaged. On appeal, the commissioner and others argued that the ad valorem tax was not a tax on imports and that the corporation's tires and tubes had lost their &quot;import&quot; status. In reversing in part, the court ruled that the tires shipped in bulk were imports under the Constitution, but they lost that status when commingled with other tires, making them subject to state taxation. In affirming in part, the court applied the &quot;original packaging doctrine&quot; in ruling that the packaged tubes remained imports not subject to taxation. The sea vans were not the original package and the unloading of the tubes from sea vans was not an incident giving rise to state taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed in part with respect to imported tires that were shipped in bulk, but were later commingled with other shipments, such that they lost their status as imports. The remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants sought review of a declaratory judgment upholding the constitutionality of the Georgia Territorial Electric Service Act (the Act), 1973 Ga. Laws 200 et seq. Appellees sought review on questions of estoppel and waiver. Appellants were a consumer and two cities and appellees were electric companies. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the Act was constitutional because appellants failed to show that it was clearly and palpably unconstitutional .The proviso in Ga. Const. art IV, &sect;1, para. 1 was intended only to prohibit the General Assembly from regulating or fixing the charges of municipally owned or operated electric systems. The Act, 1973 Ga. Laws &sect;15-A specifically disavowed any intent to violate Ga. Const. art. IV, &sect;1, para. 1. Appellants attacked the assignment of service areas based on &quot;lines&quot; but the court found that the Act operated generally upon the entire class of subjects, with which it dealt uniformly throughout the state, so there was no merit in a constitutional attack upon this ground. The court concluded that classification was permitted in the assignment of electric suppliers to consumers because it was made upon a reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>

The court held that if the indictment did not specify the section under which it was drawn, the omission was immaterial, as the offense charged was to be determined by the allegations. The court found that defendant had made no claim that the indictment as drawn was inadequate to apprise him of the charges against him. The court also held that defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the defense of entrapment, because defendant did not raise such defense at trial or request such an instruction.

The lower court, however, concluded that the entire hearing before the Civil Service Board was null and void as the employee was deprived of his vested rights under the Civil Service Act of Fulton County in an unconstitutional manner, and he was ordered reinstated. The instant court affirmed in part and reversed in part that decision. The court found that the evidentiary hearing subsequent to discharge, as provided in the Act, met the requirements of due process of law. However, the court found that under the Act the initial burden of proof was on the appointing authority to prove his charges against an employee, and since this was not done, the hearing was a nullity.

Defendants alleged that they were subjected to an illegal arrest and that the subsequent search of the vehicle was permissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court convicted defendants of armed robbery. The court affirmed. The court found no evidence of arbitrary harassment or absence of the kind of suspicious conduct that justified an investigative inquiry. After passing the service station once, which had been the scene of several recent armed robberies, the vehicle was observed a second time driving by the station and slowing down in front of the station as it had done previously. The court was of the opinion that the officer acted reasonably under the totality of the circumstances confronting him and that the activity of the automobile in which defendants were riding created a justifiable suspicion of their conduct so as to warrant the limited investigative detention. Upon asking the driver of the vehicle for his license and registration and learning that he had neither license nor automobile registration, the officer was authorized to detain the vehicle and its occupants while he communicated with the station about the ownership of the automobile. The court concluded that the limited investigative inquiry was fully authorized. The court held that defendants had no standing to object to the vehicle search.</SPAN></P>

The court held further that defendant had not been in possession of the evidence obtained without a search warrant and that the girlfriend had possession and had consented to the search.

The court held that where proof of an offense involved proof of a negative, and where the negative related to a matter peculiarly within defendant's knowledge, it was permissible to shift to defendant the burden of proving that the negative did not exist. The court held that O.C.G.A. &sect; 79A-1105 was not impliedly repealed by O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-501, as there was no conflict between the two sections. The court held that the State was not required to prove defendant's lack of authority to sell drugs, as such issue related to his defense. The court also held that pursuant to the Georgia Youthful Offender Act of 1972, O.C.G.A. &sect; 77-359(b), the trial court was not required to make a specific affirmative finding that defendant would receive no benefit under such Act before sentencing him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence revealed that defendant and another entered a private residence, tied up a mother and her teenaged daughter, shot them in the neck and head, and then took money from a safe in the home. A jury convicted defendant of two counts of murder and one count of armed robbery, and it imposed death sentences for each count. The court affirmed the sentences for the two murders after it concluded that the sentences were not excessive or disproportionate to the penalties imposed in similar cases. It also ruled that they were not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. The court further concluded that the trial court had properly admitted photographs of the daughter where they were relevant to show the location of wounds. However, in reversing the death sentence imposed for the armed robbery count, the court held that such sentence was excessive because the death penalty was rarely imposed for the offense of armed robbery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenant filed an injunctive action that sought to set aside an earlier default judgment that was obtained by the landlord against the tenant. The injunctive action challenged the constitutionality of the tacking service that was authorized by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 61-302. The trial court dismissed the injunctive action, and the court affirmed. On appeal, the court found the tenant's argument that tacking was unconstitutional did not take into account the historical and practical differences between a dispossessory action and a quasi-in-rem proceeding. The tacking of the service of process to the tenant's door was constitutional in that it was reasonably calculated to apprise him of the pendency of the action and afford him the opportunity to present his objections. Also, the proceeding in question was a quasi-in-rem action where constructive and not personal service had traditionally been utilized.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband claimed that there was no valid marriage between the parties, the trial court erred in its jury charge, the Georgia alimony statutes were unconstitutional, and he had newly discovered evidence that justified a new trial. Upon review, the court affirmed. It found that the jury's findings that the parties had a valid marriage and that no common law marriage existed between the wife and her former husband after their divorce were supported by the evidence. The husband was not entitled to a new trial because the newly discovered evidence that he sought to introduce was cumulative and could have been discovered by ordinary diligence prior to the trial through available discovery procedures. The trial court's instruction that an award of permanent alimony to the wife could later be superceded by a judgment of divorce between the parties was correct. The court had previously considered the husband's claims that the Georgia alimony laws were unconstitutional and decided the issue against him.

Code Ann. &sect; 37-2537 amounted to a denial of due process in that it arbitrarily excluded from the court's consideration all capital felony cases from which no appeal was taken and all potential death cases in which a defendant pleaded guilty to a lesser offense. Finally, defendant argued that a sentence of death could not be carried out if the jury that imposed or recommended it was chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced objections to or concerns about the death penalty. The court held that: (1) the records of all prior, similar cases were available for inspection by all defendants; (2) there were no violations of a constitutional standard in jury selection; and (3) the evidence supported the jury's findings of aggravating circumstances and a comparative sentence review revealed that the death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate to sentences imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, settlor-sole beneficiary of an inter vivos trust, executed a trust agreement naming appellee trustee as the trustee and retained the right to revoke the trust at any time.

The trial court denied both parties' motions for summary judgment and held that the trust was revocable only by the written consent of the trustee. Appellant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part.

Appellant objected to the validation on the ground that the proposed medical office building complex was not a public purpose for which the certificates could be issued. The court affirmed the validation, holding that the office building was a valid public purpose in promoting the public health needs of the county. The court held that the Hospital Authority Law was constitutional pursuant to Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; VA, para. I, which provided that any city or town could contract for the care, maintenance, and hospitalization of its indigent sick.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Contrary to defendant's contention, the court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to charge on voluntary manslaughter. The court noted that the state's evidence showed only murder and armed robbery. The court held that the evidence failed to show any sudden, violent and irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation; therefore, voluntary manslaughter was not in issue and the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury as to that principle. The court held that the death sentences imposed for the two armed robberies could not be sustained. The court stated that the two aggravating circumstances found by the jury in recommending death penalties for the two counts of armed robbery were not valid because the armed robberies were held to be aggravating circumstances authorizing the death penalties as to the murders, so the murders could not then be used in aggravation of the two armed robberies. Therefore, the two sentences of death for the offenses of armed robbery had to be set aside and the case remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants brought an action to challenge the constitutionality of the Act, which increased the number of the Board of Commissioners of Fannin County from three to five members, invested the Chairman of the Board with certain veto power, limited the compensation of the county attorney, and designated matters within the exclusive jurisdiction and control of the Board of Commissioners. The lower court held that part of the Act was void as unconstitutional, and the court held that the entire Act was void. The court found that the Georgia Constitution required that when new positions on a county board of commissioners were created, they had to be filled by election, and appointments to fill such offices were authorized only when there was a vacancy in an existing office. The court concluded that therefore, section 2 of the Act relating to increase in the number of members of the County Board of Commissioners was vital to the Act. As section 2 was unconstitutional, the remaining sections of the Act were also unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was an inmate in a prison, and after a fight broke out between other inmates, all the cells were searched. A sharpened object was found in defendant's cell, and he was convicted of possession of a deadly weapon while an inmate. The lower court denied his motion for a new trial, and the court reversed. The court found that the statute under which defendant was convicted did not violate the due process clause of the state or federal constitution. The statute was sufficiently definite to protect any prisoner who desired to obey the law, and was not unconstitutionally vague. The court stated that there was no merit to defendant's contention that the statute violated the equal protection clause. There was a reasonable basis for classifying prisoners as a definable group not permitted to have dangerous weapons. The statute was reasonable and necessary for the security and protection of correctional institutions and the people who worked and resided in such institutions. The court held that the evidence was wholly circumstantial, and was insufficient to prove defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of possession of the weapon when other inmates had access to his cell.</SPAN></P>

The general assembly appropriated money for the purpose of financing, constructing, and equipping a World Congress Center. The commission took the necessary legal steps to validate the debt in advance of its being incurred. Appellant argued that the purpose for the debt was not covered by the constitutional amendment nor was it a public purpose. The court affirmed the judgment that validated the debt obligation.

The foreclosure was conducted pursuant to a power of sale contained in a deed to secure debt. The creditor had foreclosed pursuant to the terms contained in its security deed, purchased the realty at the foreclosure sale, then sought confirmation of the sale pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 67-1503.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The debtor contended that its loan was not in default, that the foreclosure sale was improper and for less than the property's fair market value, and that the foreclosure statutes were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that whether the loan was in default and the property's fair market value were factual issues. Because there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's determination on each of those issues, the court refused to disturb those holdings. The foreclosure sale was properly held and legally conducted because the newspaper advertisement of the foreclosure described the property by the metes and bounds contained in the security deed. The term &quot;real estate&quot; as used in the foreclosure and confirmation statutes was a fixed legal concept, and when realty was described for sale using metes and bounds, the sale included all improvements that were part of the realty. Thus, the advertisement put prospective purchasers on notice that items such as improvements located on the realty were included in the sale. The court had previously held that the realty foreclosure statutes, O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect;67-1301, 67-1506, 39-1101, 39-1102, and 39-1201, were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the language of the petition was entirely adequate, and the trial court did not err in overruling intervenor's objection on this ground. The court stated that the office of state treasurer had been abolished by constitutional amendment and a commission created, and found that there was no fatal infirmity in the membership of the commission because of the absence of the treasurer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action brought by appellee political candidate, the Troup Superior Court (Georgia) ruled that the Georgia Campaign Financing Disclosure Act (Act), 1974 Ga. Laws &sect; 155, was unconstitutional and granted injunctive relief. The Act required public disclosure of contributions and expenditures made in connection with campaigns for certain elective public offices. Appellant attorney general sought review of the ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">It was asserted that the body of the Act contained matter not expressed in the title and violated the Georgia Constitution. It was argued that the title of the Act stated: to provide for the investigation by the attorney general of any apparent violations of this Act, whereas the body of the Act failed to mention the attorney general. It was urged that nowhere in the Act were candidates or other persons required to file documents with the &quot;commission;&quot; that these are directed to be filed with the secretary of state and, consequently, there are no duties for the &quot;commission&quot; to perform. It was argued that the Act failed to provide for the filing of campaign reports by certain candidates; was vague and ambiguous and violated equal protection clauses. The court found that parts of the Act were unconstitutional. However, the judiciary would not, and indeed could not, void an enactment of the general assembly merely because it was defective in part.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 106-801, -802, allowing Sunday operation of motion picture theaters and athletic events, created invidious classifications without a rational relationship to the end sought to be achieved. The court affirmed the judgment that overruled defendant's demurrer. The regulation of public billiard rooms was within the State's police power and it could reasonably prohibit their operation on Sundays. The exclusion of members and employees of the entities specified in Ga. Code &sect; 84-1616 from the Sunday closing rule was reasonably related to the legislative purpose because the State could have reasonably concluded that friendly billiards games played by persons with a community of interest and activity did not conflict with public tranquility on Sundays. The State was free to discern among types of amusements. Its different classifications for motion picture theaters, athletic events, and billiard parlors were not invidious and did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

When the Department learned of the suspension, it took action to suspend his privilege to drive in Georgia. After a hearing, the Department held that because it was acting on the doctrine of reciprocal suspensions based on foreign certificates, the lack of a prior hearing in Georgia on probable cause as to liability was not relevant. The court found that the appellate court erred when it reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that precedent relied upon the appellate court only held that the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Law did not authorize the Department to determine whether there was a reasonable possibility of judgment being rendered against a driver. The Department was not trying to do that. Instead, it was acting in compliance with O.C.G.A. &sect; 92A-609(c), to give full faith and credit to the ruling by the Florida administrative agency.</SPAN></P>

The commissioner, under authority of &sect; 92-164, levied a property tax on the value of the notes secured by Georgia property and the taxpayer paid the tax and instituted an action for a refund. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the commissioner and the taxpayer challenged the decision.

The tax was a one-time tax on long-term promissory notes secured by Georgia real estate and, while not applicable to resident federal savings and loan associations, did not violate due process because a sufficient nexus was demonstrated between the taxpayer and the state. The taxpayer solicited loans in Georgia and sent officers to the state to take applications, inspect property, and close the loans.

The court found that the statute properly provided for notice and hearing before removing a board member because it contained a &quot;for cause&quot; provision and this met the requirements of due process. The court found that the authority's prior actions of adopting a resolution in an attempt to discharge the member were void because they failed to give the member notice and hearing of the charges against him prior to taking the action, and this deprived the member of due process of law as guaranteed by Ga.

She suffered numerous physical injuries. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. It held that the trial court did not err in excusing jurors who said they could not impose the death penalty under any circumstances. It held that photographs of the victim taken two days after the rape, her clothing, and an earring torn from her ear were relevant in that they evidenced the force used against her and corroborated her testimony that she did not consent to the acts against her. It held that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury on the law of conspiracy where defendant had not been charged with conspiracy. It held that the state's failure to offer evidence of aggravating circumstances at the pre-sentence hearing did not invalidate the death sentence because the hearing was for additional evidence and did not exclude from consideration the matters heard on the issue of guilt and innocence. Finally, the court conducted a sentence review and held that the death sentence was not improperly imposed or excessive in relation to penalties imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

Defendant grabbed them by the neck, told them to take their clothes off, committed anal sodomy on them, and then choked them to death. The trial court convicted him of two counts of murder and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the court affirmed. The verdict was not contrary to the evidence. There was ample evidence to support the verdict, and the verdict was not contrary to the law and principles of justice and equity. Because the State did not rely on circumstantial evidence alone, there being direct evidence, the trial court did not err in failing to charge that, before conviction could be had upon circumstantial evidence alone, the proven facts had to be not only consistent with the hypothesis of guilt but had to exclude any other reasonable theory or hypothesis save guilt of the accused. The sentences of death imposed were not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. The evidence supported the jury's finding of statutory aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from an order of the Wayne Superior Court (Georgia), which convicted him of rape and imposed a death sentence under O.C.G.A. &sect; 27-2534.1 (1969). Defendant was also convicted of two counts of armed robbery and one count of kidnapping and the sentence imposed for each count was 20 years imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended that the death penalty statute, O.C.G.A. &sect; 27-2534.1, violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court reviewed the history of the United States Supreme Court's disapproval of prior death penalty statutes and the changes made to O.C.G.A. &sect; 27-2534.1 by O.C.G.A. &sect; 27-2537. O.C.G.A. &sect; 27-2537 narrowed and guided the discretion of the sentencing authority, allowed the death penalty only for the most outrageous crimes, allowed for an automatic appellate review, required comparative sentencing, and required the court to ascertain the record had not indicated arbitrariness or discrimination in the imposition of the death sentence. The court held that the death penalty as imposed by O.C.G.A. &sect; 27-2534.1 was in compliance with the relevant constitutional concerns. The court reversed the death penalty in application to defendant, holding that although there was no evidence of passion or prejudice in the verdict, the sentence was not consistent with other sentences imposed for the crime of rape. The record did not support defendant's contention that he was denied the opportunity to compile evidence of the exclusion of minorities from the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for rape, two counts of armed robbery, and one count of kidnapping. The court held that the Georgia death penalty statute passed constitutional muster. However, the court set aside the death sentence imposed on defendant for the rape charge and remanded that charge for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The savings and loan challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The savings and loan association, which operated outside of Georgia, held a long-term promissory note executed by a Georgia corporation. The corporation also delivered a deed to the association to secure payment of the note. In order to record the security deed, the association was forced to pay an intangible tax under O.C.G.A &sect; 92-164. The association argued that the tax constituted a denial of equal protection because savings and loan associations operating within the state did not have to pay the tax. The trial court granted summary judgment to the state taxing officials, but the court reversed. The court rejected the taxing officials' argument that the tax was merely a tax on intangible property, namely, the note secured by the real estate. A promissory note held by the association could not be taxed because the taxable situs of the property was not in Georgia. Promissory notes held by a non-resident corporation at their domicile in another state were not taxable within the state. Neither was the tax legal because it could not be applicable only to out-of-state associations and not to Georgia-based associations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant alleged that portions of the Act which concerned marijuana were unconstitutional for the following reasons: (1) They denied due process of law under the State and Federal Constitutions; (2) they were an unlawful exercise of the state's police power; (3) they denied the individual's right to the enjoyment of life, liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness; and (4) they constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court found that the record did not clearly demonstrate that marijuana was such a harmless substance that the Georgia General Assembly had no right to make its sale and possession criminal. The court rejected appellant's contention that the mere private possession of marijuana may not be prohibited by the state. The court found that the statute was not unconstitutional in defining marijuana under the term &quot;depressant or stimulant drug&quot; under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 79A-903(b)(5).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee district attorney claimed that the film &quot;Deep Throat&quot; was obscene. Appellants argued that the Georgia statutes that permitted suppression of obscenity by the State were unconstitutional, and that the temporary suppression of the film, prior to a final judicial determination that it is obscene, constituted &quot;prior restraint&quot; that was violative of First Amendment rights. The court disagreed and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court stated that there was no suppression by the State of the film until after an adversary judicial hearing. Appellants stipulated that they had been exhibiting the film and the trial court viewed the film at the hearing. The trial court found that the film was obscene pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-2101. The court held that O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-2101 was constitutional; the trial court was duly authorized to use the definition of obscenity contained therein; the exhibition of the film was a crime pursuant to the statute; and the further exhibition of the film was properly enjoined.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county commissioners (county) challenged the decision of the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia), which denied their motion to grant supersedeas and stay the injunction ordered previously against them at the request of appellees, citizens and taxpayers. The citizens and taxpayers had filed a petition for declaratory judgment attacking the validity of a state statute which authorized the grant of state funds for county roads and maintenance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statute, 1973 Ga. Laws 475, known as Act No. 229 of the Georgia General Assembly (Act), authorized the grant of state funds to aid in the construction of county roads and maintenance upon each county's providing a property tax credit in accordance with formulas prescribed in the Act. The court held that the issue of the funds appropriated in 1973 were moot as the county had collected ad valorem taxes and that the state funds, pursuant to the Act, were disbursed in accordance which such collections. Thus, no viable issue existed and the injunction issued restraining further disbursements was moot on that issue. The court further held that the trial court erred in overruling the county's motion to dismiss and in granting injunctive relief to the citizens and taxpayers because the statute did not violate the due process or equal protection provisions of the United States or Georgia Constitutions. The court found that the classification structure of the tax credit formulas contained in the condition required for the grant of the funds to the county was a reasonable classification and within the constitutional power of the Georgia General Assembly.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the state statute was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant contended that his commitment to the department of corrections was a denial of his constitutional rights of equal protection and due process of law. Appellant argued that he was tried without the benefit of a jury yet was being treated as a convicted criminal. The court of appeals affirmed the adjudication. The court also affirmed, holding that the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in committing appellant to the custody of the corrections department. Under O.C.G.A. &sect; 24A-2401, a child could not be committed to a penal facility used primarily for the incarceration of persons convicted of crimes. However, under O.C.G.A. &sect; 24A-2304, a child could be committed to the custody of the department of corrections. Appellant's adjudication as a delinquent meant that he was subject to treatment and rehabilitation. If appellant was not amenable to treatment in a facility operated by the division of children and youth, the juvenile court was free to commit him to a facility with greater security and protection measures operated by the corrections department. The commitment to an authorized facility, however, was not a commitment for the conviction of a crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, adult book store owner and related persons (book store owner), appealed the decision from the DeKalb Superior Court (Georgia), which entered judgment in favor of plaintiff state in its suit for an injunction to shut down a book store as a public nuisance. The book store owner argued that the relevant statutes used were prior restraints and overly broad thereby infringing on First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state relied upon both state law and a county ordinance banning the operation of adult businesses in certain areas. At trial, the state only established that some of the seized material was obscene.  Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-2103 authorized that the selling of obscene material under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-2101(b) was a public nuisance. The appellate court reversed. The state had the authority to take measures to limit obscenity through injunctive relief. However, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-2103 constituted a prior restraint in this instance since the entire store was permanently shut down over some obscene material without the proper determination of obscenity.  Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 23-3402 and Code of DeKalb County, Ga., Part II, Chap. 10, Art. VI, two of the laws relied upon banning adult establishments, were unconstitutionally overly broad for the imposition of criminal and civil sanctions for otherwise protected expression. The laws defined adult establishment too broadly and did not clearly define obscenity. Certain exhibits that were clearly obscene were properly enjoined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the superior court entering an injunction in favor of the state against the book store owner shutting down a book store that sold adult materials was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the trial court declared the homestead exemption statute, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 92-233 (b), was unconstitutional. According to the cooperative corporation, the cooperative ownership concept in the statute was included within the term &quot;owner&quot; as that term was used in the constitutional provision. The cooperative owners urged that the one who holds under an occupancy agreement as a stockholder of a non-profit cooperative ownership housing corporation was an &quot;owner&quot; within the meaning of the Constitutional Homestead Exemption. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the trial court was correct in determining that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 92-233 (b), which attempted to grant a homestead exemption to cooperative owners, was violative of Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; I, Par. IV. The court also held that a cooperative corporation as the &quot;owner,&quot; was not eligible for the exemption since it did not actually occupy the property as a residence and homestead. Moreover, the court held that only those homestead exemptions from taxation specifically authorized by the Constitution were valid.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment. The court stated that the holding of a commitment hearing was not a requisite to a trial for commission of a felony and that whether or not there was a commitment hearing did not affect the legality of the present detention. The court noted that petitioner's arguments in support of the ineffective assistance ground were an attempt to raise the sufficiency of the evidence and presented nothing for decision upon petition for habeas corpus. The court pointed out that a state did not waive its right to have a prisoner returned to complete his sentence by temporarily relinquishing him to the authorities of another jurisdiction prior to the completion of the sentence.</SPAN></P>

Laws 136, 139, codified at O.C.G.A. &sect; 113-1002. The trial court held that the statute, which authorized a year's support out of the estate of a deceased for the benefit of his widow, or widow and minor child or children, or child or children, had insufficient provisions for notice to interested parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees, daughter and daughter-in-law, filed a caveat to the widow's application under the Year's Support Statute, O.C.G.A. &sect; 113-1002. The record showed that their attorney knew of the widow's application on the day it was filed and promptly requested a hearing. On appeal, the court noted that in the absence of a proper attack upon the constitutionality of a statute, neither the trial court nor the court could declare a statute unconstitutional. The court held that a party could not bring such an attack unless he could show the enforcement of the statute was an infringement upon his rights and that such infringement resulted from the unconstitutional feature of the statute upon which he based his attack. The court held that there must be a real effect on the party's rights and a real injury. The court found that the appellees here had actual notice of the proceedings and therefore could not complain about the notice provisions of the statute. The court held that the appellees could not make a valid attack on the constitutionality of the notice provisions and that the trial court was without authority to declare the statute to be unconstitutional on such ground.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that the films were hard-core pornography and that showing of the films should have been enjoined in that their exhibition to consenting adults was not protected by U.S. Const. amend.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint was filed on May 4, 1973, and service perfected by &quot;tacking&quot; a copy of the summons on the door on May 8, 1973, which summons required the tenant to answer on May 15, 1973.  When the tenant failed to answer, a writ of possession was issued on June 5, 1973.  On June 14, 1973 the tenant filed a motion to set aside the writ of possession in which motion it was alleged that the tenant had no notice or knowledge of the proceedings until June 13, 1973, when he was informed by a marshal of such court that the writ of possession would be executed on June 14, 1973.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion and the tenant brought a direct appeal with the court, alleging the unconstitutionality of &sect; 61-302(a). The court dismissed the appeal, holding that it lacked jurisdiction because, based on the circumstances, the tenant could not bring a direct appeal with the court. Because the nature of the dispute was one merely for possession of the premises, there was no dollar amount in controversy; therefore, the tenant could not bring a direct appeal with the court and was required to first seek review from the appellate court by means of certiorari.</SPAN></P>

She sought to enforce her alimony judgment by writ of fieri facias pursuant to &sect; 30-204. Her husband challenged the act's constitutionality on the ground that it was improper to issue an execution of a judgment without giving him notice and a hearing as to the issuance of the fieri facias. The lower court disagreed. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that &sect; 30-204 was constitutional. The wife was entitled to a fieri facias for the purpose of enforcing her alimony judgment whenever and as often as installments were unpaid. The mere issuance of an execution in the general execution docket was not a taking of property. Rather, a taking occurred after a sale of property by a levying officer. In that circumstance, notice and a hearing were necessary, if a taking was objected to.

The adoptive father filed a motion to dismiss the complaint because it did not set out a cause of action in law or equity and because the biological mother was equitably barred from enforcing her complaint because of lapse of time and laches. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment. The court held that the constitutional attack made on Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 74-408 was without merit because in construing &sect; 74-408 with &sect; 74-403, the legislature intended to authorize minor parents to consent to the adoption of their children and to act as persons sui juris in all respects in such adoption proceedings.</SPAN></P>

After concluding that &sect; 23 of the Appellate Practice Act, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 6-701, authorized an appeal to be taken from a contempt order, irrespective of whether the order found to have been wilfully violated was an interlocutory order or a final judgment, the court then held that there was no necessity for an application for a discharge as a condition precedent to appeal. Addressing the merits of the husband's appeal, the court reviewed the final divorce decree, for which the husband was adjudged in contempt for not making monthly payments on a mobile home. Specifically, the divorce decree provided that the wife shall have the use and possession of the mobile home, but it was silent as to the obligation of either party to make payments on the home. Because neither party was obligated under the decree to make the payments, the court reversed the adjudication of contempt against the husband.</SPAN></P>

The jury deliberated over defendant's sentence but was discharged by the trial judge after 31 minutes and the trial judge imposed sentence.

The court found that defendant could not object to the constitutionality of the sentencing statute because he failed to preserve that issue for appellate review. The court rejected defendant's assertions that he was deprived of his right to be present during all stages of the trial because the trial court judge conducted ex parte conversations with the jurors after they were excused and before he imposed sentence. The court found that the conversations with the jurors were of no effect to the proceedings because the jurors had been excused and had not further responsibility in the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">By their action, the taxpayers challenged the Commissioners' assessment of ad valorem taxes. After the trial court entered its orders in the taxpayers' case, the Commissioner appealed. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did have jurisdiction to hear the taxpayers case even though the taxpayers had failed to tender the county ad valorem taxes. According to the court, the trial court had jurisdiction because when a county ad valorem tax was attacked, as in this case, as being &quot;wholly&quot; illegal, tender was not required. With respect to the trial court's order directing the county tax officials to collect taxes based on a tax digest, which was not approved by the Commissioner, the Commissioner complained that the trial court should have ordered the digest resubmitted to the Commissioner for approval. The court held that the trial court was authorized to temporarily direct the payment of taxes on some rational basis. However, the court held that the part of the trial court's order directing the refund of taxes paid prior to January 15, 1972 was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's refusal to dismiss the writ of garnishment requested by the creditor. The court rejected the debtor's argument that the Georgia garnishment statute was unconstitutional because it did not provide the debtor with notice and an opportunity to be heard before his property was taken. The court held that the writ of garnishment was ancillary to the main action pending between the debtor and creditor. The court held that the effect of the writ of garnishment was to impound any asset or property of the debtor that was found in the hands of the bank pending the resolution of the merits of the creditor's claim. The court held that the writ itself constituted a lis pendens notice that a right to perfect a lien on the garnished property existed. The court held that the garnishment of wages was a limited exception to the general rule of legality of garnishment statutes.</SPAN></P>

He contended further that because he had been adjudged insane and released &quot;other than restored,&quot; and the State had failed to introduce any evidence to rebut the defense of insanity, the verdict of the jury was contrary to the law and the evidence. The court held that because the evidence presented showed that the conditions justifying defendant's hospitalization for mental illness no longer existed, the burden of proof of insanity was properly placed upon defendant, and the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury that the State had the burden of proving his sanity.</SPAN></P>

Both the individual judgment creditor and the individual judgment debtor were foreign citizens. On appeal, the judgment debtors argued that the attachment statutes of Georgia were unconstitutional because they did not provide for prior notice or allow an opportunity to challenge the issues of attachment prior to seizure of the property. The court found that the Georgia attachment statute was not violative of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the United States Constitution, O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 1-804, 1-805, as applied to Georgia by the Fourteenth Amendment, O.C.G.A. &sect; 1-804. The court also noted that the judgment creditors had failed to show that there was a lack of probable cause to issue the attachments. The court also pointed out that the judgment debtor, who was a foreign citizen, consented to the fact that property left within the State was subject to judicial process. The court also noted that the attachment statute was narrowly drawn so that it satisfied due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

The heirs argued that O.C.G.A. &sect; 113-909 denied the wife the right of inheritance after she killed her husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband conveyed the property to his wife and reserved a life estate in an undivided one-half interest in the property. The deed provided that if the wife predeceased the husband, the property would revert to him. The wife killed her husband and conveyed the property to the grantee, who was her son. The heirs argued that because she killed her husband, &sect; 113-909 denied her the right to inherit the property or to convey it. Defendants argued that &sect; 113-909 did not apply. The trial court denied defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings and overruled their first defense. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 113-909 was inapplicable because the wife did not stand to inherit the property upon her husband's death; she had a vested interest in the property before his death. Section 113-909 divested the right of inheritance for property that the wife stood to inherit upon the death of her husband and in the event that she killed him with malice aforethought. Because the wife already had a vested interest in the property and did not stand to inherit any interest by the death of her husband, &sect; 113-909 was inapplicable, and the wife could convey the property to the grantee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The broadcasting company sought summary judgment in a case concerning the disclosure of the identity of a female victim of the crime of rape. The trial court denied its motion and the court affirmed.  Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-9901 provided that the identity of a female victim of the crime of rape shall not be disclosed by the news media. This statute did not prevent disclosure or publication of the event; it merely prohibited the disclosure or publication of the identity of the victim of the event. The court rejected the broadcasting company's implicit argument that the statute was unconstitutional as violative of the First Amendment. Instead, the court found that the statute was a legitimate limitation on the right of freedom of expression contained in the First Amendment. It found that there was no public interest or general concern about the identity of the victim of such a crime that would make the right to disclose the identity of the victim rise to the level of First Amendment protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the statute prohibiting disclosure of the identity of the female victim of the crime of rape was constitutional and thus the disclosure of the identity of the victim of such a crime was not a matter of public interest and general concern.

The court of appeals did not rule upon the enumeration of errors or on the motion, but certified the following question to the court: Is Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 67-701 violative of Ga. Const. article I, &sect; I, para. III, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-103? The court did not answer the certified question holding that the constitutional question of denial of due process was not necessary to a determination of the case because the debtor had both notice and a hearing before her property was seized, and because no constitutional issue was raised by either party in the trial court. The court would never pass upon the constitutionality of an Act of the General Assembly of the State of Georgia unless it clearly appeared in the record that the point was directly and properly made in a lower below and distinctly passed on by a trial judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The public drunkenness statute provided that a person, who appeared in an intoxicated condition in any public place which condition was made manifest by boisterousness, or by indecent condition or act, or by vulgar, profane, loud, or unbecoming language, was guilty of a misdemeanor, O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-2607. After defendant was arrested of public drunkenness, he filed a motion to dismiss the charge. However, the trial court denied defendant's motion. After the trial court entered an order convicting defendant of public drunkenness, defendant appealed. The first issue raised on appeal was whether the Georgia public drunkenness statute was constitutional. The second issue raised on appeal was whether the evidence supported a finding of guilt. The court held it was unnecessary to pass on the constitutionality of the public drunkenness statute because the evidence was insufficient to sustain defendant's conviction. Furthermore, the court held that mere public drunkenness was not enough to sustain a conviction. Moreover, the court held that to complete the offense, the State was required to prove not only that defendant was drunk in public, but that he also committed some indecent act.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, the indictment charged defendant, a licensed physician, with prescribing prescription drugs to individuals when such actions were not in the ordinary and authorized course of his profession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that O.C.G.A. &sect; 79A-907(a)(5) specifically exempted licensed physicians from &sect; 79A-907(b), which prohibited persons from selling, delivering, or otherwise disposing of any depressant or stimulant drug to any other person. The court disagreed and affirmed the overruling of defendant's motion to quash. The court explained that the only reasonable interpretation &sect; 79A-904(a)(5) was to limit the exemption to physicians so that the only occasions when physicians did not incur a criminal penalty when prescribing stimulant or depressant drugs was when they were acting in the course of their professional practice. The court opined that, construing O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 79A-904(b) and 79A-907(a)(5) and (b) together, the Georgia Drug Abuse Control Act prohibited physicians from selling, delivering, or otherwise disposing of any depressant or stimulant drug to any other person except while acting in the course of their professional practice.
