</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father alleged that the son was a person in need of supervision in that he was beyond the lawful control of his parents. Moreover, the father contended that his son threatened him with a knife and damaged household property. Thereafter, the son had been &quot;voluntarily&quot; placed in a residential treatment center, at which time he ran away and returned home. The father then amended his petition to add an additional allegation that the son truanted from school for over two years and truanted while in placement. The court held that a general allegation that the son was beyond the lawful control of his parents could not be utilized as a predicate to subject the son's life to parental attack. Furthermore, the court held that the son's liberty interest suffered substantial infringement by his placement at the residential treatment center against his will. Additionally, the court held that the father failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the son was sufficiently truant from school prior to the placement in order to sustain a finding that he was incorrigible, ungovernable or habitually disobedient and beyond the lawful control of his parents. Thus, the petition was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The due process rights accorded to a respondent in a juvenile delinquency proceeding apply with equal force to a respondent in a person in need of supervision (PINS) proceeding since a PINS proceeding is quasi-criminal in nature, involving the potential for significant governmental interference in the liberty of the child (Family Ct Act, &sect;&sect; 754, 756) and, therefore, a general allegation in a PINS petition that a respondent is beyond the lawful control of his parents does not afford a PINS respondent adequate notice of the charges (Family Ct Act, &sect; 732, subd [a]) and may not be utilized as a predicate to subject the child's life to parental attack; the parents' voluntary placement of the 13-year-old respondent in foster care (Social Services Law, &sect; 358-a) against his will at a residential facility housing voluntarily placed children, PINS and juvenile delinquents creates a sufficient deprivation of liberty so as to require review by a neutral fact finder and since the failure to hold such review for over seven months violated respondent's constitutional rights to due process of law, respondent was legally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  justified in absconding from the placement and his refusal to return to the facility cannot constitute behavior sufficient to sustain the PINS proceeding; accordingly, the PINS petition is dismissed and a final order of protection issued to the child directing petitioner father to cease and desist in his efforts to have respondent return to the facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Person in Need of Supervision -- Truancy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The failure of the 13-year-old respondent to attend school at a foster care residential facility where he was placed against his will by his parents in violation of his constitutional due process rights due to the lack of a review by a neutral fact finder for over seven months cannot be grounds to sustain a person in need of supervision (PINS) proceeding since respondent lacked the requisite intent to be truant from school or to disobey the mandates of article 65 of the Education Law inasmuch as his truancy was a manifestation of his deep-seated desire not to be at the facility, a desire that was never evaluated in a manner consistent with constitutional due process; respondent's sporadic absences from school prior to his placement are insufficient to support a PINS&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  finding since, in order to sustain a PINS finding on the basis of truancy, there must be a substantial and intentional failure to attend school and such has not been established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Person in Need of Supervision</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Where a child is placed at a foster care residential treatment center pursuant to a voluntary placement (Social Services Law, &sect; 358-a), it is inappropriate for that facility to suggest the filing of a person in need of supervision petition (Family Ct Act, &sect; 732, subd [a]) because of behavior that presumably led to the child's placement there in the first place since the function of such facilities is to treat such behavior and not complain about it.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss a petition designating him as a predicate felon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his conviction for robbery, when he was 18 years old and without any prior felony convictions, was unconstitutional. Specifically, he argued that the sentencing court failed to enter an express finding as to his possible youthful offender status. The state supreme court held that this did not constitute a &quot;constitutional infirmity&quot; for purposes of using such conviction in calculating his subsequent predicate felony status. Defendant further argued that his defense counsel failed to request youthful offender treatment. The court found that his counsel's actions did not violate his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance where the conviction resulted from an indictment including both robbery in first-degree count and robbery in second-degree count. The court also noted that, at such time, defendant already had a prior record of eight arrests and five misdemeanor convictions. Moreover, the alleged robbery involved the use of a gun, and defendant, under a plea arrangement obtained by counsel, was permitted to plead to a single D felony to cover the indictment and received only a five-year probationary sentence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Second Felony Offender -- Validity of Predicate Offense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The failure of the sentencing court, in 1974, to enter an express finding regarding defendant's eligibility for youthful offender status does not constitute such constitutional infirmity as would nullify his conviction for purposes of enhancing the penalty upon a subsequent felony conviction ( CPL 400.21, subd 7); furthermore, although defendant had a constitutional right to reasonably competent legal representation, his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was not violated on the predicate charge, since his attorney's failure to request youthful offender status for defendant during plea bargaining negotiations was knowing and strategic, resulting in a lenient sentence under circumstances where youthful offender status was unlikely in light of defendant's prior record. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate proceedings under N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law art. 7, petitioners, taxpaying veterans, appealed an assessment of their real property by respondent assessors on the ground it was overvalued by reason of the operation of N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 458(5) as interpreted by the N.Y. Board of Equalization and Assessment. The veterans also sought a declaratory judgment that such statute, as interpreted, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The veterans all qualified for the veterans' exemption under N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 458. Section 458(5)(a) provided an automatic proportionate tax exemption to veterans residing in a tax district where the change to full value assessment was court ordered while &sect; 458(5)(b) gave the same exemption to veterans living in tax districts where the change was voluntary only if the tax district so provided by local law. The Board issued an opinion that &sect; 458(5)(b) operated prospectively and that the only tax districts that could pass local laws giving veterans the same increase in exemption provided for in &sect; 458(5)(a) were those tax districts that changed to full value assessment after a certain date. The court entered judgment in favor of the veterans, declaring unconstitutional as violative of the Equal Protection Clause that portion of &sect; 458(5) that required the passage of a local law in order for some veterans to gain the exemption and directed the assessors to change the veterans' assessments. Applying a rational basis test, the court could not conceive of any justification for distinguishing between veterans based solely upon geographical location.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While section 458 (subd 5, par [a]) of the Real Property Tax Law grants an automatic proportionate tax exemption to veterans residing in a tax district where the change to full value property assessment was court ordered, section 458 (subd 5, par [b]) makes the same exemption for veterans residing in tax districts where the change was voluntary contingent upon the tax district so providing by local law and, thus, is unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause since there is no rational basis for such inconsistent application of the exemption to similarly situated veterans and the court cannot conceive of any state of facts that would justify distinguishing between veterans solely upon the basis of whether the tax districts in which they reside went to full value assessment by court order or voluntarily.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner interested parties appealed a decision by respondent New York City Board of Standards and Appeals (board), which refused to revoke a certificate of occupancy issued by the buildings department to respondent non-profit company, which ran drug rehabilitation facilities. Petitioners claimed that the certificate was contrary to the Zoning Resolution of the City of New York (resolution) and that the resolution was void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buildings department concluded, and the board agreed, that under the broad language of the resolution the premises involved could be operated as a drug-abusers' rehabilitation center as a matter of right, without any need for a special permit from any agency. Petitioners' case was essentially that the resolution was so broad and all-encompassing that it was unconstitutionally void for vagueness and overbreadth, and hence rendered any action taken under it as void. The court affirmed the decision that upheld the resolution and the decision to issue the certificate of occupancy. Petitioners did not have standing to challenge the zoning resolution under a void-for-vagueness argument because they did not claim that they were performing any act regulated by the resolution, and they had no standing to claim that it was void as to third parties by reason of vagueness. Even if they had standing, the resolution was not vague or ambiguous; although the resolution was broad, it was not vague, as those were two separate concepts. Although the statute swept a wide path, it swept it very neatly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The determination of the board was upheld, and the petition was dismissed, in petitioners' challenge to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy to a non-profit company that operated drug-abusers' rehabilitation facilities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a CPLR article 78 proceeding, petitioners lack standing to seek an annulment of the certificate of occupancy granted to respondents for premises to be operated as a drug-abusers' rehabilitation facility on the ground that the language of the Zoning Resolution of the City of New York under which the certificate was granted is so broad as to make it unconstitutionally void for vagueness since such an argument is only available to one who acknowledges that his own conduct falls within the ambit of the statute he attacks, either on its face or as it is interpreted by those charged with its enforcement, and petitioners do not claim that they are performing any act regulated by the statute in question.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to four years with no minimum term specified. After his conviction but prior to the sentence, the Legislature amended N.Y.

However, in defendant's case, the statutory minimum would have been one month longer than the minimum imposed by the Parole Board.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was properly sentenced to serve an indeterminate term of imprisonment not to exceed four years, with no minimum term specified, although section 70.00 (subd 3, par [b]) of the Penal Law was amended, following his conviction of a class E felony but prior to sentencing, to provide for a minimum term of imprisonment of one year but not more than one third of the maximum imposed, since the statute is silent as to retroactive application and should only be applied retroactively where it ameliorates the sentence; in the instant case, fixing the minimum sentence at one third of the maximum, or 16 months, is a greater punishment than a sentence fixing no minimum, since the Parole Board fixed a minimum of 15 months.  In any event, the sentence was reviewed by the Appellate Division after the effective date of the statutory amendment and unanimously affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife sued defendant husband, alleging cruel and inhuman treatment and abandonment. Husband filed a motion to preclude evidence going to the cruelty claim on equitable distribution issues. The wife sought to withdraw her abandonment action so that only the issue of cruelty remained. In addressing the parties' motions, the court focused on the issue of whether to consider marital fault under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 236(B)(5)(d), cl. 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reviewing the parties' equitable distribution, the court held that equitable distribution was premised on a concept of partnership. Because a partner in a business enterprise still received his or her share on dissolution of a partnership, so should a partner in marriage. The court found that the dissolution of the marriage itself acted as relief for the &quot;innocent&quot; partner. Accordingly, the court held that fault was not a consideration under &sect; 236(B)(5)(d), cl. 10, and evidence of fault was inadmissible in the determination of equitable distribution. In so holding, the court concluded that (1) any additional consideration of fault went beyond the reasonable interpretation of the language of &sect; 236(B)(5)(d) cl. 10; (2) consideration of fault caused lengthy, burdensome, excessive, and ultimately inconclusive litigation; and (3) assigning fault resulted in impermissible punishment for protected private activity, or resulted in invidious gender discrimination of a sort the legislature specifically excluded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;fault&quot; of one spouse may not be considered with respect to equitable distribution of marital property in a matrimonial action under section 236 (part B, subd 5, par d, cl [10]) of the Domestic Relations Law; equitable distribution is premised on the concept of partnership and, as would the partner in a business enterprise who commits adultery, who drinks excessively or, as here, is allegedly homosexual, the &quot;guilty&quot; spouse still receives his or her share of the assets on dissolution of the partnership, with the termination of the marriage itself comprising the relief for the &quot;innocent&quot; spouse. Accordingly, on defendant husband's motion, plaintiff wife is granted a judgment of divorce upon the uncontested ground of abandonment ( CPLR 3212, subd [b]) and plaintiff's motion at trial to withdraw the abandonment cause of action is denied ( CPLR 3217, subd [b]); although plaintiff might have sustained her burden of proof on a second cause of action for cruelty, she would ultimately be entitled to no more than a judgment of divorce and would have gained no further rights or benefits by pursuing said claim, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  since evidence of cruelty would not be admissible upon the only remaining issue, equitable distribution of the parties' marital property. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action to recover moneys claimed due and owing on a promissory note executed by defendant corporation and a guarantee executed by defendant guarantor, plaintiff promisee moved to confirm an order of attachment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The promisee brought an action to recover moneys claimed due and owing on a promissory note executed by the corporation and a guarantee executed by the guarantor. The issue raised in the case was whether the five-day period to confirm an attachment order pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 6211(b) ran from the date the first levy occurred regardless of whether the garnishee was in possession of the property or debt sought to be attached or if it ran from the date the order was served on a garnishee who was actually in possession of property belonging to the guarantor. The court concluded Rule 6211(b) was to be interpreted to require the promisee to move to confirm the order of attachment within five days from the date the order was served on the first garnishee regardless of whether the garnishee was then holding property belonging to the guarantor. Upon finding that the promisee did not move to confirm the order within five days after the order was first served, his motion to confirm was denied and the guarantor's motion to vacate the order of attachment was granted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The failure of a plaintiff to make a motion on notice to confirm an ex parte order of attachment within five days of levy as required by CPLR 6211 (subd [b]) is fatal and invalidates the order and, furthermore, where an ex parte order of attachment is levied at different times on several garnishees, the five-day period to confirm the order runs from the date of the first levy, regardless of whether the garnishee first served is in possession of the property or debt of the defendant sought to be attached for jurisdictional or security purposes; if the five-day period to confirm did not begin to run until the order was served on a garnishee presently holding property belonging to the debtor defendant, an unknowing debtor defendant could have his assets placed in jeopardy of immediate attachment for an extended period of time ( CPLR 6214, subd [b]) and, knowing that any assets received from the defendant might have to be transferred to the Sheriff, it is unlikely that a garnishee not holding property belonging to defendant would continue to transact business with him once served with the order of attachment, thus depriving the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of his ability to transfer or alienate his property without notice or an opportunity for an immediate hearing, which would undermine the purpose of CPLR 6211 (subd [b]) and jeopardize the constitutional validity of the statute as applied.  </SPAN></P>

The court denied the owner's motion and granted the commission's motion, with the exception of certain documents. The court held that the commission was empowered to conduct the investigation under 1958 N.Y. Laws ch. 989 and N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 3. The court found that the owner's due process rights were satisfied by the commission's compliance with N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 73. The court found that the records sought bore a reasonable relation with the matter under investigation and the public purpose served. The court found that the subpoenas sought relevant information relative to the ownership interest, value and insurance claims, but not relative to corporate minutes, tax returns and financial statements, thus, limited the requested order to compel compliance.</SPAN></P>

The rent-controlled tenant executed a renewal lease for three years. During the lease, the landlord entered into a modest rehabilitation contract with D.H.P.D. The tenant remained in his apartment during the rehabilitation project. Under the newly-enacted &sect; 608 and after the rehabilitation project was completed, D.H.P.D. set the initial rent that the landlord could charge. The landlord filed a petition against the tenant when the tenant remitted the rental amount specified under his lease. The initial rent increase was three times the amount of the tenant's rent. The court noted that there was no caselaw interpreting the application of a rent increase to a pre-existing lease. It held that the initial rent increase granted by D.H.P.D. to the landlord did not affect existing leases. It found the tenant's rent remained the same amount found in the unexpired lease agreement. The increase was to be held in abeyance until the lease expired, at which time the landlord could offer the tenant a new one or two-year lease with the new rental amount specified in it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The store owners sold smoking accessories that could be considered drug paraphernalia. Although the store owners had filed an action challenging the constitutionality of art. 39 in federal court, the parties vacated the federal court order and dismissed the action by stipulation. Therefore, the court held the state action was not barred by res judicata. The store owners also stopped selling single-use items after a state court decision that those items were validly prohibited under an ordinance with provisions similar to art. 39. The only issue remaining was the application of art. 39 to multi-use items. The court held that art. 39 was constitutional under both the federal and New York Constitutions, because it could be applied validly to the sale and display of single-use items and, under the court's construction, it mandated post-seizure hearing and notice. The court granted the store owners' request for a preliminary injunction regarding the sale and display of multi-use items and ordered an expeditious trial of the factual issues involved.</SPAN></P>

However, an application by plaintiff boutique and novelty shop owners, who sell and display only multiuse items, for a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the statute pending a trial on the issue of the constitutionality of the statute as applied to the sale of items suitable for legal or illegal purposes, is granted; plaintiffs are not barred herein from litigating claims which were raised or which could have been raised in a prior Federal action, since said action terminated in a stipulation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of dismissal and was not a final judgment against plaintiffs on the merits.  </SPAN></P>

The radar detector clearly obstructed only the driver's view of an area of the auto's hood. The State asserted that &sect; 375(30) forbade any obstruction of the windshield. At trial, the arresting officer testified that he had interpreted the law as having been violated if the object was of sufficient size to obstruct vision through the windshield and the road ahead. Objects such as Kleenex boxes, dice from the mirror, cigarettes, sun glasses, gum, candy, pencils, and toll receipts did not violate the law. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional. Although it specified that the window obstruction had to have prevented a full and clear view of the road and condition of the traffic behind the vehicle, it contained no such standard for the more important view to the front. The arresting officer had added his own interpretation of the statute with an intent to arrest defendant for having a radar detector.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 8-100(2) provided, in part, that the polls would be open for voting in State primary elections between noon and 9:00 p.m. in all counties except in the City of New York and selected urban counties, where the polls would be open between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. Plaintiffs contended, among other things, that &sect; 8-100(2) denied them the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city abandoned a portion of a public street in connection with a plan to promote the expansion of the corporation's business. The church, whose parking lot abutted the abandoned street, claimed that the ordinance was invalid. The court granted summary judgment to the city and corporation, holding that the city provided the appropriate notice for amending its official map under N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 29 and that there was no requirement that the church be directly notified. Further, &sect; 29 authorized the city to close existing streets whenever and as often as it might deem it for the public interest, and there was evidence supporting the city's conclusion that closing the street would promote the expansion of business and job opportunities, increase the city's tax base, and lead to an improvement of traffic conditions. The abandonment did not deprive church members of suitable access to the church because its parking lot could still be entered from another street. The fact that access was made more circuitous by an additional four tenths of a mile, upon paved city streets, did not render such access unsuitable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners brought an action under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 against respondents, the Board of Estimate of the City of New York (New York), a corporation, and another party, seeking judicial review of the Board's actions in amending the New York City Zoning Resolution and in amending the zoning map.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought review of the Board's actions creating a special zoning district and amending the zoning map to delineate the district's boundaries. They argued that the form of notice given to the public by the Board violated the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court stated that a merely formal notice, not calculated to reach the members of the community affected, did not fulfill the legislative intent behind New York City, N.Y., Charter &sect; 197-c. Publication in obscure publications much more likely to be read by some lawyers, professional planners, and real estate developers than by the man or woman in the street, completely failed to provide adequate notice to the community. If residents of a local community were to be put on notice, the notice ought to have been placed in a newspaper of general circulation within the community. Because of inadequate notice, the Board's actions in amending the zoning map and in granting a special permit could not stand. It was constitutionally impermissible to grant by law a right to be heard at a public hearing on the one hand, and on the other to adopt a notice procedure that rendered that right utterly meaningless.</SPAN></P>

The voters brought an action challenging the statute as violative of equal protection, and the court declared the provisions extending the polling hours to be unconstitutional. The court held that the provisions struck at the very heart of a person's voting rights because every person should have been entitled to the same opportunity to vote. The state failed to meet its burden of showing a justification for the extensions, which presented the danger of discouraging voter turnout. However, because only the extension provisions were unconstitutional, the proper remedy was to strike only those provisions from &sect; 8-100(2).</SPAN></P>

Fixing hours for voting is a legislative task and, as such, the court cannot extend the voting hours in the three counties represented by petitioners; the only alternative is to excise the unconstitutional exception in the statute, thereby leaving all polling places open from noon until 9:00 p.m. </SPAN></P>

The bank sought to recover for monies advanced to the borrower for credit card purchases made by the borrower and/or his designees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borrower contended that the bank was a nonresident corporation within the meaning of &sect; 8501(a). The bank asserted that it was exempt from the requirements of &sect; 8501(a) and that the application of &sect; 8501(a) against it was unconstitutional. The court noted that the bank removed itself from the State to South Dakota for the purpose of charging higher interest rates to its customers than was permitted by New York law. Although Congress had the authority to regulate all national banks, it had not preempted the application of State law to national banks to exempt them from &sect; 8501(a). The National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C.S &sect; 24, empowered the bank to sue in the New York but did not mandate the bank's exemption from N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 8501(a). There was no federal or State legislative intention to exempt the bank from &sect; 8501. The filing of security costs under &sect; 8501(a) did not expressly conflict with federal law, frustrate the bank's purpose, or impair the efficiency of the bank's discharge of its federal duties. The bank had voluntarily chosen nonresident status and was not permitted to circumvent the constitutional provisions of &sect; 8501(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the children had a guardian. The parents and the guardian filed separate actions to require the department to furnish services to the handicapped children without termination of their custody of the children. The department failed to answer. The court consolidated the actions. A prior federal court had held in a class action on behalf of all handicapped children that N.Y. Soc. Serv.

The court found no evidence that the federal case was not still good law. Therefore, the children were members of the class, and N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect;&sect; 358-a; 384-a were without effect.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court was a paternity proceeding instituted by petitioner, a child's maternal grandmother, against respondent, the alleged father, to have the alleged father declared to be the father of the child. The child's mother had died. Respondent, the named father on the birth certificate, was joined as a necessary party. Both respondents acknowledged the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandmother also filed a petition for custody against the named father, who was directed to file a custody proceeding since the mother was deceased. Therefore, the named father filed a petition against the grandmother. The named father then moved to dismiss the paternity petition on the grounds that the action had abated by reason of the mother's death. The court found, however, that it had the statutory authority to proceed upon the death of the mother by virtue of N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 522, which authorized the guardian or next of kin to initiate a paternity action on behalf of the child. To accept the named father's construction of N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 518 to require the abatement of the action because of the mother's death would have run counter to United States Supreme Court holdings, and to hold that the child's right to status or to support abated and that his grandmother, as his next of kin who had the responsibility for his care, could not file the action less than a year after the death of the mother would have been unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The marshal had been terminated from office after he was convicted of certain crimes relating to official duties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The marshal began working for another city marshal sometime after his removal from office. Respondent department alleged that the marshal's new duties went beyond clerical. The marshal alleged that the directive was unfair and its application to him was unreasonable. The court held its final determination in abeyance until a referee reported the acts that constituted the marshal's offenses and the nature of his new duties. The court held that the department was empowered to issue the directive and the directive itself was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The court determined that the directive did not violate equal protection when applied to the marshal because he forfeited his right to hold such an office and did not have a right to be employed in the specific position from which he had been lawfully removed. The court concluded, however, that without information as to the underlying acts and the nature of the marshal's duties, it could not determine whether the department had acted arbitrarily and capriciously.</SPAN></P>

In denying the applicant's petition to annul the board's decision, the court held that the board's conclusion that the applicant was a tout, as that term was defined in the context of racing, and that his activities were not in the best interests of racing was neither arbitrary, capricious, nor an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners challenged the constitutionality of the reapportionment plan found in 1982 N.Y. Laws 111, and sought injunctive relief. Respondents filed cross motions for dismissal or for summary judgment. The court held that the challenges were justiciable because pursuant to N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 5 and 1911 N.Y. Laws 773, &sect; 1 an apportionment by the legislature was subject to immediate judicial review. The court granted summary judgment for respondents, holding that 1982 N.Y. Laws 111 was in accord with all of the subsisting provisions of N.Y. Const. art. III, and thus was a valid and constitutional apportionment statute. The court rejected petitioners' contention that the oddly shaped designs of the reapportionment plan violated the State Constitution's antigerrymander provisions, which required that legislative districts were &quot;compact&quot;, &quot;contiguous,&quot; and &quot;convenient.&quot; Petitioners' challenge on the ground of &quot;partisan gerrymandering,&quot; raised a &quot;nonjusticiable issue.&quot; Petitioners did not contest that the plan complied with the overriding principle of &quot;one person, one vote.&quot; Moreover, the court noted that with respect to Assembly districts there was no county line requirement.</SPAN></P>

A reapportionment plan for State legislative districts (L 1982, ch 111, as amd) is subject to immediate judicial review (NY Const, art III, &sect; 5) and the fact any reapportionment plan affecting Kings County must be submitted to the United States Attorney General for approval under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 does not make a challenge to the reapportionment plan premature and thus nonjusticiable; a judicial review of a State reapportionment statute is not a contest to select the &quot;best&quot; reapportionment but is limited to the sole question as to whether the statute passes constitutional muster with due regard to the rule that a presumption of constitutionality attaches to every statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court awarded the wife a judgment of divorce. The primary issue that remained was the valuation of the husband's interest in a closed corporation.

The court found that N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect;&sect; 236(B)(5)(d) and (6)(a) were not unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the effective date for evaluation of marital property was the date the husband began his divorce action. The method of valuation found in the Rev.

Defendant wife has failed to establish her right to a constructive trust on plaintiff husband's interest in a closely held corporation, a claim she interposed in the parties' divorce action; defendant is unable to sustain her burden of proof, as there is no evidence of a promise, or any testimony of a reliance on any promise implied or otherwise, and the marriage of the wife and husband does not by itself provide a basis for an implied promise which would support the imposition of a constructive trust. Furthermore, the action is barred by the six-year Statute of Limitations pursuant to CPLR 213, as the statute runs from the commission, rather than the discovery, of the alleged fraud in an action to impose a constructive trust.</SPAN></P>

The date on which to base valuation of marital property under the Equitable Distribution Law is upon &quot;the execution of a separation agreement or the commencement of a matrimonial action&quot; (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 236, part B, subd 1, par c); thus, where the parties never executed a separation agreement and the only prior court proceeding was a Family Court proceeding instituted by the wife for support, the commencement of the husband's action for divorce in February of 1979 is the date on which to base valuation of marital property, notwithstanding the withdrawal without prejudice of the husband's action at the trial of the wife's divorce action, which she commenced in August of 1980.  Accordingly, the husband's share of certain rental property, acquired after the date he commenced his action for divorce, is not marital property; however, said property is considered by the court in connection with the husband's ability to pay maintenance and child support.</SPAN></P>

The court valued the husband's interest in a closely held corporation as marital property for purposes of equitable distribution in a divorce action (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 236, part B, subd 1, par c) utilizingRevenue Ruling 59-60 of the Internal Revenue Service to capitalize earnings, with certain adjustments: (1) the weighted average income of the company over the five years preceding the valuation date was arrived at after the income reported for each year was increased by 13% to reflect the percentage of variance between actual and reported profit determined by the court after certain corporate business deductions were disallowed as unverified in the most recently reported tax year, and (2) an earning&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  power multiplicant of 6, rather than 8 as proposed by the wife, was applied to the resulting average weighted income to reflect a lower capitalization rate appropriate to the &quot;key man&quot; character of the husband's business.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to the offense of attempted robbery in the first degree with an option to withdraw the plea if he were determined to be a second felony offender. The People filed a statement of predicate felony conviction alleging that defendant was convicted of housebreaking in South Carolina. The South Carolina court suspended defendant's five-year prison sentence and placed him on probation for five years with the additional condition that he was banished from South Carolina during the probation period. Defendant alleged that the sentence was unconstitutional. The court found that defendant received two sentences: (1) a five-year prison term, which the South Carolina court suspended, and (2) a five-year probation. The court held that even though the banishment portion of defendant's sentence was illegal as cruel and unusual punishment, the remainder of the judgment and sentence were valid. The court rejected defendant's argument that the South Carolina sentence violated his right to interstate travel, holding that a convicted felon's right to travel was not absolute. Jail sentences and certain probation conditions were permissible restrictions on travel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's conviction, upon his plea of guilty, to a felony in South Carolina, is valid and may serve as the predicate felony for sentencing defendant in New York as a second felony offender, despite the fact that the suspended sentence of five years' imprisonment and five years' probation imposed in South Carolina was illegal, void and unenforceable to the extent that, as a condition of probation, it was agreed that defendant would go to New York and would not return to South Carolina during the period of probation; although a conviction requires a valid sentence for second felony offender purposes (Penal Law, &sect; 70.06, subd 1, par [b], cl [ii]), here, the invalid &quot;banishment&quot; portion of the sentence is separable from the valid portion of the sentence. </SPAN></P>

The appeal was confined to only that portion of the trial court's order dismissing the charge under &sect; 240.20(2) as unconstitutional. The court reversed the dismissal of that part of the indictment because the city court, as a court of first instance, should not have set aside as unconstitutional that statute as such conclusion was not inescapable, particularly as a court of appeals had implicitly, if not explicitly, upheld the validity of the statute. There was a strong presumption of constitutionality of statutes and the unconstitutionality of the statute had to be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt.The statute prohibited making unreasonable noise with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance, or claim or recklessly creating a risk.

The court stated that it had to be determined whether or not all prospect of the nonmarital child's eventual success under N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 4-1.2(a), para. 2, cl. C, was foreclosed as a matter of law by the enactment's provision that it would take effect on the first day of September next succeeding the date on which it would have become law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed a petition pro se to enforce his rights allegedly violated when he was a prisoner in the county jail. The inmate sought the institution of criminal charges against a correction officer he claimed struck him with a ring of keys. The court appointed an attorney to represent the inmate. Respondent sheriff and former county district attorney filed a motion to dismiss the petition under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7804(f).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the petition brought under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 was an appropriate procedural vehicle and that the technical procedural shortcomings did not call for dismissal. The court pointed out that it could not have ordered the former district attorney to file criminal charges. The court added that the sheriff undertook an investigation of the prisoner's complaint with timely dispatch, and the court found his actions commendable. The court further found no basis for concluding that the manner in which sheriff delivered a report of investigation to the prisoner, orally, was arbitrary, capricious, tyrannical, unreasonable, or not in the exercise of honest discretion. Although the court denied the inmate's request for orders directed at the sheriff and the former district attorney, it issued a declaratory judgment on what it determined was a justiciable controversy. The court held that the inmate had a right to request a criminal proceeding, and noted that the same books, forms, and personnel which were previously available to prisoners to initiate proceedings to get out of jail would henceforward have been available to initiate proceedings to get others in jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a declaratory judgment that the inmate had a right of access to the state criminal courts for the purpose of initiating a criminal proceeding against the correction officer he accused of hitting him with a set of keys.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A petition brought pursuant to CPLR article 78 is an appropriate procedural vehicle to compel the District Attorney and the County Sheriff to take what petitioner contends to be officially required action in criminal court in connection with petitioner's allegation that a correction officer struck petitioner with a ring of keys while he was incarcerated in the county jail since such a petition does not seek a review of a determination in a criminal case but rather seeks to compel performance of an act which the court is empowered to do by means of an article 78 proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pleading -- Petition -- Form of Verification</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A petition in a CPLR article 78 proceeding which did not contain the formal language of a verification but which was sworn to by petitioner before a notary public and bore the signature and stamp of the notary is sufficient to satisfy the verification requirement of CPLR 7804 (subd [d]).</SPAN></P>

Petitioner prisoner's request for a written report of an investigation conducted by a County Sheriff into alleged mistreatment of the petitioner by a correction officer is denied since there is no requirement under State law that prisoners' complaints be investigated and, furthermore, there is no authority which obligates the Sheriff to deliver a written report of such investigation if conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Due Process -- Prisoner's Right of Access to Courts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A prisoner has a constitutional right of access to the courts for the purpose of instituting a criminal charge on his own initiative against a correction officer who is alleged to have committed a criminal act against him since a denial to a prisoner of freedom to communicate to the courts serves no public interest and, therefore, would be an arbitrary exercise of power prohibited by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; moreover, such holding is buttressed by the fact that the criminal act complained of, being struck by a ring of keys, could, if proven, constitute a violation of the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment provided by the Federal and State Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Anyone who is directly harmed by alleged criminal conduct can file an accusatory information unless the statute defining the illegal conduct specifically states otherwise, or the asserted illegal conduct is too remotely connected to the interest to be protected and, therefore, prisoners should be included among those so eligible since deprivation of access to the courts is not a necessary or reasonable concomitant of incarceration.  </SPAN></P>

The court denied the accused's motion for summary determination of an order of mandamus without prejudice to renew and denied the NYPD's motion to dismiss. It found that various factual questions were unanswered which precluded summary disposition. The NYPD did not plead that the property was suspected of being employed in the criminal mischief alleged and the seized property did not reasonably appear to be contraband or instrumentalities to commit a crime. Further, the NYPD did prove that any of the seized property was held as evidence in any pending criminal investigation or proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brought a motion to dismiss an indictment against him for burglary in the second-degree, pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 140.25(2), on the grounds that a recent amendment to the burglary statute, which reclassified a daytime burglary of a dwelling as a violent C felony with a mandatory prison sentence, was violative of defendant's right to due process and constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the daytime burglary of a dwelling unconstitutionally constituted the commission of the crime of burglary in the second-degree, a violent C felony, after an amendment to &sect; 140.25(2) removed the requirement that the offense occur &quot;at night.&quot; Prior to the amendment, the acts alleged in the indictment against defendant would have only constituted the commission of the crime of burglary in the third-degree, a class D felony. On consideration of defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment, however, the court instead ordered the indictment amended to charge defendant with burglary in the third-degree. Specifically, the court held that the amendment to &sect; 140.25(2) violated defendant's right to due process of law and made defendant's conduct disproportionate to his offense, thus constituting cruel and unusual punishment. Nevertheless, the court held that the conduct alleged in the indictment still constituted the crime of burglary in the third-degree, pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 140.20, before or after the amendment at issue. Accordingly, the court ordered the indictment amended to charge defendant with burglary in the third-degree.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An indictment charging defendant with burglary in the second degree in that he knowingly entered or remained unlawfully in a dwelling during the daytime on February 6, 1981, is amended to read burglary in the third degree, since the September 1, 1981 amendment to subdivision 2 of section 140.25 of the Penal Law, which deleted the phrase &quot;and the entering or remaining occurs at night&quot; from the statute and reclassified a daytime burglary of a dwelling from a class D felony to a class C felony with a mandatory State prison sentence violates defendant's rights to due process and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment; the sentencing implications of the amendment were not foreseen and other crimes which the Legislature has classified as violent C felonies all involve either the actual use of force against a person or the potential for such force and violence by the possession or display of a weapon. A legislative act must bear a rational relationship between the classification employed in the statute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and some legitimate State purpose and by making a daytime dwelling burglary a violent C felony the Legislature has failed to acknowledge the difference in culpability and potential for personal confrontation between a day and night burglary and has thus mandated a punishment greatly disproportionate to the offense actually committed. </SPAN></P>

The court held that a town councilman was not employed to sue the board of appeals and such an action was not within the scope of his employment or duties unless he has been directed to bring the action in the name of the town by the town board.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties' argument centered on the constitutionality of N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 182. The court found that the amendment to &sect; 182 resulted in the taxation of certain oil companies, but not others. In defining vertically integrated companies for the purposes of &sect; 182, no tax was imposed upon the activity of production and refining. The tax was not enacted solely upon volume of sales of certain oil companies rather than others. Because there was no evidence of an arbitrary classification in the statute, the taxpayer's argument that certain oil companies were not subject to the tax was a question for the legislature to decide rather than a court. The taxpayer failed to demonstrate that the creation of the class of vertically integrated was without a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

Two defendants were convicted of the offense while the third defendant's charge was dismissed upon a determination, following a hearing, that &sect; 240.53, subd. 3 violated her constitutional rights. Defendants appealed claiming that &sect; 240.35, subd. 3 violated their rights protected by the Federal and State Constitutions because it prohibited lawful conduct. In addition, the State appealed the dismissal of the third defendant's case claiming that &sect; 240.35, subd. 3 was valid. The court ruled that the issue was not whether the prohibited act under &sect; 240.35, subd. 3 was criminal but whether its proscription was rationally related to the interests of public morality.

The court held that defendant's contention with regard to the robbery conviction was without merit. However, the court held that the convictions could not be used as predicate violent felonies because the statute on its face did not provide for the use of a conviction that was obtained prior to the enactment of the violent felony statute.

Exec. Law &sect; 63(12) in seeking fraudulent church-related charitable income tax exemptions, violating N.Y. Bus. Law art. 23-A et seq. by engaging in an unlawful pyramid scheme, and violating N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an initial matter, the court held that purported religious foundation and members had engaged in fraud by claiming certain charitable federal income tax exemptions, as both the inurement and operational requirements of 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 501(c)(3) were violated by the operation, in whole or part, of sanctioned subsidiary churches for the private purposes of members. The court thus held that any attempt to deduct non-exempt contributions to the parties was a fraudulent and deceptive practice in violation of N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 63(12). The court further found that attorney general was authorized to seek relief on proof of a pyramid scheme in violation of N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 359-fff, additionally noting that the giving of tax advice constituted the unlawful practice of law in violation of N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 478. Although the court did dismiss the petition with respect to members for whom no prima facie case was made, it then granted the requested relief as to the remaining parties, concluding that the claim of free exercise of religion was not a shield to an unlawful claim of tax exemption, the improper holding out as an attorney, and the fraudulent pyramid scheme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both charges were based upon the contention that defendant was a recipient of the food stamp program and failed to disclose the receipt of an educational loan in the amount of $ 2,470. In determining that the indictment required dismissal, the court held that although it entertained serious reservations about the constitutionality of N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect;&sect; 147, 95, insofar as they represented penal statutory provisions, it was unnecessary to decide those issues. The court found that whether based upon constitutional grounds or not, it was clear that in order for &sect;&sect; 147, 95 to take on any meaning, reference to federal and/or state regulations, or the federal statute was necessary. The court found that the Grand Jury was not provided with sufficient information as to the regulations to enable it to intelligently decide whether or not a crime had been committed. The falsity of the information provided by defendant was based upon a definition of income as specified in the regulations or 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2014, the substance of which was not provided to the Grand Jury.

An indictment charging defendant, a recipient of food stamps, with misuse of food stamps (Social Services Law, &sect; 147) in that she failed to disclose the receipt of a New York State Higher Education Service Corporation loan is dismissed; although section 147 of the Social Services Law purportedly makes the acquisition of food stamps with a value more than $ 250 a felony if done in a manner not authorized by section 95 of the Social Services Law, which merely places certain affirmative duties upon the Commissioner of Social Services, the statute fails to give notice that a recipient of food stamps is required to report income, or assuming such a duty, that income would encompass an educational loan.  Additionally, to the extent that sections 147 and 95 of the Social Services Law incorporate Federal and State regulations, criminal prosecution raises serious constitutional questions concerning due process and delegation of legislative powers (see NY Const, art III), and in any event, the Grand Jury was not provided with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sufficient information to enable it to intelligently decide whether or not a crime had been committed because it was unaware of the substance of any of the applicable regulations.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, one of the Grand Jury witnesses testified that State and Federal regulations required the defendant to report her loan as income, and CPL 190.25 (subd 6) expressly provides that the only legal advisors of the Grand Jury are the court and the District Attorney.  </SPAN></P>

The indictment charged the weapon counts as felonies rather than misdemeanors because of defendant's prior conviction for misdemeanor assault.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state had filed a motion to amend the date on the special information of defendant's previous conviction, stating that the incorrect date was a typographical error.

There was no statutory authority for the challenge, and the evidence did not fall into any of the enumerated categories of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 710.20. Therefore, the court treated the challenge as a motion to controvert, found the plea unconstitutional, and held that it could not be used against defendant on the charges for possession of weapons. Defendant could not have commenced the challenge before trial of his weapons charges because he did not have actual knowledge that the state was relying on the conviction until after trial began. The court could not have delayed the motion because the issue went to the nature and degree of the crime, a decision that was necessary before defendant commenced his defense. The guilty plea for assault was unconstitutional because it was apparent to the that court that defendant was delusional and incapable of assisting his counsel.</SPAN></P>

A special information filed after the commencement of trial, which alleges the defendant's conviction of a prior crime so as to elevate a misdemeanor to a felony, such as criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (Penal Law, &sect; 265.02, subd [1]), may be amended to reflect the correct date of the prior conviction notwithstanding the fact that there is no express statutory authority for amending a special information as there is with an indictment or a bill of particulars since a special information is in the nature of a bill of particulars and logic and reason dictate that the court has the inherent power to permit the amendment of a special information after first inquiring into and confirming that the Grand Jury did in fact indict defendant for a felony by reason of the proper prior conviction; legislative action is recommended to provide for the amending of a special information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a jury verdict, the court convicted defendant of manslaughter in the first degree. Before the court was the issue of whether defendant's two previous felony convictions were unconstitutionally obtained and therefore could not be used to sentence him as a persistent violent felony offender pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.08 and N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 400.16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his Utah conviction for assault with a deadly weapon by one convict upon another and his federal guilty-plea conviction for bank robbery were unconstitutionally obtained. The court disagreed and held that the convictions could be used for sentence enhancement purposes. The absence of the Utah trial transcript, which was destroyed after 10 years as a result of established administrative procedure in Utah, did not constitute denial of due process because defendant had been afforded his right to appeal. Under principles of collateral estoppel and full faith and credit, defendant could not contest an alleged Miranda violation in the Utah proceedings because the issue had already been resolved by the highest Utah appellate court. Moreover, defendant had failed to overcome the presumption of regularity of the Utah proceedings. The 10-year tolling provision of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.06 did not violate defendant's equal protection rights because it was not irrational to distinguish between a prisoner and a non-prisoner. The federal guilty plea was not improper because the record indicated that it was knowing and voluntary and that defendant was competent to plead guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defendant's prior felony convictions could be used for sentence enhancement purposes and that the court was thus mandated to sentence defendant as a persistent violent felon.</SPAN></P>

While a defendant is entitled to the transcript of a trial or its reconstructed equivalent for the purpose of implementing a clear right to appeal, there is no concomitant right to preserve a trial transcript long after the defendant has been afforded the right to appeal; accordingly, in a proceeding to determine whether defendant's previous felony convictions require that he be sentenced as a persistent violent felony offender ( CPL 400.15, subd 7, par [b]; 400.21, subd 7, par [b]), the absence of the transcript of a 1966 Utah trial, which resulted in defendant's felony conviction for assaulting another prison inmate with a knife, does not constitute denial of due process of law that automatically precludes a fair assessment of the events surrounding the Utah trial since the facts have otherwise been adequately reconstructed and defendant's allegation that additional constitutional errors would become apparent if the trial transcript were available is pure speculation and is no basis for controverting the Utah conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first denied a change of venue because there were no facts in questions, only questions of law, and no hearing was necessary. The court then held that the State of New York mandated that full-time district attorneys be paid certain minimum salaries, based on the population of the county. Allegany County had enacted a law stipulating a lower salary. The court held that N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 183-a was not a special law and that it applied to all full-time district attorneys. Thus, Allegany County's attempt to amend &sect; 183-a was invalid. That certain counties with a small population could choose to make the position part time did not effect the statutory compensation scheme. The salary of a district attorney was not just a matter of local concern. Effective fighting of crime in one county inured to the benefit of the whole State. Finally, the court held that it was not an arbitrary act on the part of the legislature to insist that full-time district attorneys make at least as much as the judges before whom they practice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner, the full-time District Attorney of Allegany County, is granted judgment ordering the county board of legislators and the County Treasurer to pay him the minimum salary mandated by section 183-a of the Judiciary Law. The statute is a general law, which applies to all full-time District Attorneys in the State (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 3, subd [d], par [1]), not a special law, and an attempt to amend section 183-a by a local law setting petitioner's salary at a lower figure is invalid; respondents failed to sustain the heavy burden of proving the statute unconstitutional, as it was not an arbitrary act on the part of the Legislature to insist that full-time District Attorneys make at least as much as the County Judges before whom they practice, and although the variation and disparity amongst the County Judges' salaries as established by the Legislature may be irrational, unfair or even unconstitutional, it does not invalidate that section requiring District Attorneys to be paid as much as those Judges.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, who were adjacent property owners, brought an N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 action against respondent, a town's superintendent of highways, seeking a judgment prohibiting the creation of a private road that was requested by intervenors, who were property owners, pursuant to N.Y. High. Law &sect; 300 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenors applied for a private road link between their property and a public highway that would pass across petitioners' property. Petitioners' property contained no right of way for the benefit of intervenors' property. In their action to prohibit the superintendent from creating the private road, petitioners contended that the state and federal constitutions prohibited the taking of private property for the gain of private interests and that &sect; 300 et seq. authorized private individuals to use the public power of eminent domain to take private property for exclusively private use. In denying petitioners' requested relief, the court held that the connecting of private property with the public highways was in the public interest; the taking of private property for such a purpose was a public use sufficient to sustain &sect; 300 et seq. as constitutional even in the absence of N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 7(c), which authorized the construction of private roads. The court also determined that the underlying petition was not defective for failing to provide a survey of the proposed roadway in courses and distances because N.Y. High.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The public benefit to which the taking of property by eminent domain is constitutionally limited is not restricted to sole occupancy and use by the public.

Further, with respect to plaintiff's contention that the regulation violates sections 200 and 204 of the Civil Service Law by changing the terms and conditions of employment, a change that can only be effected through the collective bargaining process, the Supreme Court lacks jurisdiction to resolve the claim, as the Board of Collective Bargaining has exclusive, nondelegable jurisdiction over improper labor practice charges.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first action, the patient claimed that the anesthesiologist's delay in reporting to the delivery room compelled her to give birth without any anesthesia.

In the third action, the patient claimed that he was misinformed about the malignancy of a node in his left groin. In the fourth action, the executor claimed that the doctor refused to hospitalize the patient, despite the fact that the patient had a tumor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city filed a motion for summary judgment to dismiss an action initiated by plaintiff landowners who alleged that they suffered damages due to a delay in construction that was negligently or maliciously wantonly, and unlawfully caused by the city, depriving the landowners of their civil rights under the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners applied to the city to rezone their property. The city council eventually voted in favor of the rezoning after hearing both opposition and approval of the rezoning. The mayor vetoed the action and the city council voted to override the mayor's veto. The city's corporation counsel filed an opinion with the county clerk, stating that the veto override was invalid. As a result, the landowners were denied a building permit. A proceeding was held, finding that the override vote was valid, which was affirmed on appeal, and a building permit was eventually issued. The landowners brought an action against the city for damages, alleging that due to a construction delay negligently or maliciously, wantonly, and unlawfully caused by the city, they were deprived of their constitutional civil rights. The city filed a motion for summary judgment. The court granted the city summary judgment, ruling that the evidence established that although the landowners may have experienced some deprivation of their property interests due to the opinion of the city's corporation counsel, there was no intrusion on their right to contract and no denial of any of their constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

In granting the requested relief, the court held the action was not time barred because: 1) the district attorney had not known of the refusal until the year's final paycheck; and 2) the time barrier had been inapplicable as the county had failed to comply with a continuing statutory duty. The court also rejected the contention that &sect; 183-a was an unconstitutional exercise of legislative authority in that it did not qualify as a general law under N.Y. Const. art.

Furthermore, said compensation plan is not inconsistent with section 201 of the County Law, which authorizes the county board of supervisors to set the salaries of county officers, inasmuch as, even assuming that section 201 applies to petitioner's position, the board is still free to set his salary above the minimum level established under section 183-a of the Judiciary Law.  </SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the company failed to carry the burden to show that the enactment violated the United States Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a class action suit brought by plaintiff city, defendants, individual and corporate taxpayers, filed a motion for summary judgment against the city for the refund of real property taxes paid from 1974 through 1978.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city commenced a class action against the taxpayers. The court certified two major classes of taxpayers: those who allegedly paid their taxes under protest and those who did not. The taxpayers answered and counterclaimed for a refund of their taxes illegally collected by the city from 1974 through 1978. The city uniformly replied to each counterclaim by asserting the affirmative defense of the one-year limitation in the city charter. First, the court held that the taxpayers' claims for tax refunds were timely asserted because an action to recover taxes paid on an unconstitutional levy was based upon an implied contractual obligation that was subject to a six-year statute of limitations which accrued when the taxes were paid. Second, the court held that only those taxpayers who paid their taxes under appropriate legal protest were entitled to refunds. Illegal taxes voluntarily paid were not recoverable. Moreover, taxpayers could recover refunds for each year that their checks or receipts were stamped &quot;paid under protest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted summary judgment to those taxpayers who could prove that they paid their taxes under protest, but the city was entitled to summary judgment against those taxpayers who did not make appropriate legal protest of their taxes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Inasmuch as an action to recover taxes paid on an unconstitutional levy is based upon an implied contractual obligation and thus subject to a six-year Statute of Limitations, a provision of the Charter of the City of Buffalo which provides a one-year limitation period for the commencement of an action to test the validity of a tax does not bar an action in which defendants seek a refund of property taxes which the city had unconstitutionally levied from 1974 through 1978, since the action is not one to test the validity of the tax but rather to recover taxes paid which had already been held unconstitutional for each of the four years in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments -- Collateral Estoppel -- Application to Multiple Taxpayer Suits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The doctrine of collateral estoppel has no application to multiple taxpayer suits; accordingly, although the City of Buffalo failed to assert a defense of a one-year Statute of Limitations contained in its city charter in any prior taxpayer suits, it is not collaterally estopped from asserting that defense in a pending multiple taxpayer suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Illegal Taxes -- Payment under Protest or Duress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A taxpayer may not recover for payment of illegal taxes unless they were paid under protest or duress; accordingly, defendant taxpayers who failed to protest their payment of taxes unconstitutionally levied by the City of Buffalo are not entitled to refunds since the city's knowledge of the illegality of the tax does not obviate the protest requirement and the nonprotesting defendants did not pay under duress since they were neither confronted with a severe interest penalty nor was their liberty or the immediate possession of their property threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Illegal Taxes -- Manner of Protest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The protest required of a taxpayer in order to recover for payment of an illegal tax must be made in writing, at the time of payment, in each year for which recovery is sought, but need not specify the legal basis upon which the taxes are involuntarily paid; accordingly, in an action to recover for payment of taxes unconstitutionally levied by the City of Buffalo, taxpayers who sent letters of protest with their checks, indorsed &quot;paid in protest&quot; on their checks or requested that the taxing authority similarly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  stamp their tax receipts are entitled to refunds for the tax years in which protest was made.  </SPAN></P>

The court further noted that it could not ignore the obvious meaning of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 314. The court recognized that Rule 314, which authorized out-of-state service in certain actions, applied only to in rem actions. The court further noted that if it applied petitioners' interpretation of Rule 314, the statute would be rendered unconstitutional. The court also recognized that Fam. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed a motion to suppress physical evidence obtained by the police pursuant to a search warrant they obtained after determining that a defendant that owned an auto salvage yard did not have a dismantler's license as required by N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 415-a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A defendant that owned the auto salvage yard argued that N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 415-a was unconstitutional. The court rejected the argument because pursuant to that law the auto dismantling industry was pervasively regulated, and therefore warrantless administrative searches were an exception under U.S. Const. amend. IV. Furthermore, &sect; 415-a was not vague because it gave notice to auto dismantlers that their premises were subject to inspection. Thus a search of the auto salvage yard upon the police observing the dismantling of a car and finding that the defendant owner of the salvage yard did not have a dismantler's license was proper. One defendant that was physically made to return to the salvage yard, prior to the police observing the dismantling of the car, was seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and the seizure was unlawful because at that point there was no reasonable suspicion that a crime had been committed. A search warrant obtained by police was not defective for having the wrong address when it contained the right name of the business, and even though undated it was executed within 10 days of issuance as required by N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 690.30(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the constitutionality of the Vehicle and Traffic Law as it permitted warrantless administrative searches of auto dismantlers. The search warrant obtained by the police was deemed valid. The court found one defendant who was arrested before evidence of a crime was found had his constitutional rights violated and the seizure of property against him was improper and suppressed. Otherwise, the motion to suppress was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Legislature has demonstrated its intention to pervasively regulate the vehicle dismantling industry by the enactment of section 415-a of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, and since the performance required under the statute is set forth with sufficient clarity so that a person of common intelligence can ascertain its meaning, said statute is constitutional and a warrantless administrative search conducted pursuant thereto was proper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The seizure of defendant's person as he was walking away from a vehicle dismantling shop which was suspected of operating illegally, by a police officer who was investigating the shop, was unlawful and the fruits thereof must be suppressed where the officer did not have probable cause or even a reasonable suspicion to believe that defendant had committed a crime.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Search Warrant -- Technical Errors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A search warrant which improperly listed the premises to be searched as &quot;Jasons II Auto Salvage&quot; at &quot;94-40 Merrick Blvd.&quot; instead of &quot;Jasons Auto Salvage II&quot; at &quot;94-04 Merrick Blvd.&quot; was proper and valid where it was clear that the premises were authorized to be searched, that they could be identified with reasonable effort and that there was no probability of a search being made of premises other than those intended to be searched under the warrant, since technical errors in a portion of the description of the premises to be searched will not invalidate a warrant under those circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was given the Miranda warnings, followed by a breathalyzer test and completion of an alcoholic influence report form. Defendant claimed that when the police officer stopped his vehicle to issue him an appearance ticket for speeding, he was in custody and entitled to Miranda warnings. The People argued that a stop of this nature did not constitute custody. The court found that the issuance of a speeding ticket was not tantamount to an arrest and, therefore, the Miranda warnings were given at an appropriate time.

The medical board of the police pension fund examined the officer and determined that he was disabled to due a knee injury; the medical board unanimously recommended that he be granted accidental disability status. The board of trustees denied the officer's application for an accidental disability retirement pension on the ground that his injury was not accidental because there had been no intervention of an external fortuitous event, proximately causing the injury. In annulling the board of trustees' determination, the court held that the board of trustees acted capriciously in failing to rely on the unanimous findings of the medical board and in relying upon a standard that had no statutory basis. Specifically, the court found that the board of trustees' standard that an injury be caused by the intervention of an external fortuitous event flew in the face of New York City, N.Y., Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding against respondent correctional superintendent seeking to expunge a disciplinary report against him based on statements made by the inmate in a grievance filed against a correctional officer. The petition was initially dismissed, but the court sua sponte granted reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The initial dismissal of the petition was based on a finding that the disciplinary report had not been filed as a reprisal, but because the officer had sincerely believed the inmate's statements in the grievance to be lies. The grievance had been based on the allegation that the officer was failing to consistently honor a pass authorizing the inmate to go to certain areas. The court found that: (1) the disciplinary report had been based solely on the grievance statements; (2) a grievance was privileged and immune from use as the basis of a disciplinary report for lying; (3) the potential to use a grievance as the basis of a disciplinary report would threaten the inmate's First Amendment rights; (4) the filing of the grievance was protected under N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 139; and (5) it was therefore proper to expunge the disciplinary report.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the disciplinary report based on the grievance should be expunged from the inmate's record and that any material drawn from the grievance should be barred from use as the basis of a disciplinary report or sanction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A disciplinary report for lying filed by a correction officer against a prisoner based solely upon alleged false statements made by the prisoner in a grievance filed against the officer is an unconstitutional abridgement of First Amendment rights and thus cannot stand since, although the State has an interest in protecting the integrity of its correctional system through disciplinary reports, there is no showing that the concomitant effect of discouraging the filing of grievances provided for by statute (Correction Law, &sect; 139) is necessary to that purpose; material contained in a grievance must be privileged and immune from use as a basis for a disciplinary report for lying since any possibility of reprisal must be avoided in order to have the system of informal settlement of inmate grievances operate smoothly. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner religious diocese and intervening petitioner disabilities agency filed an action seeking to overturn respondent government agents' denial of a use permit applied for by the diocese and disabilities agency. The purpose of the use permit was to change the program of a building from a residential care institution for predelinquent and delinquent young men to an intermediate care facility for the developmentally handicapped.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The diocese and disabilities agency argued that the proposed use permit did not constitute a change in use that required approval of the government agents. They also argued that the denial of the use permit contravened the state's policy of favoring implementation of intermediate care facilities and that denial of the permit unconstitutionally interfered with the diocese's religious function. The court rejected such arguments and upheld the denial of the use permit. The court found that the proposed change in use was not a more restrictive change under the zoning ordinance. Also, the court rejected the argument that the proposed use was not a change in use at all, as the facts and circumstances demonstrated that the use of the facility would be changed. The court also noted that a state policy favoring implementation of programs such as the one at issue did not require that local laws be disregarded. Finally, the court noted that the denial of the proposed use permit did not unconstitutionally interfere with any religious function because the proposed use was not actually a religious use.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner's application for a use permit to change the program of a building from a Boys Town, a permissible nonconforming use, to an intermediate care facility for the developmentally disabled was properly denied by the Buffalo Zoning Board since the Buffalo Zoning Ordinance prohibits a change in use of a building devoted to a nonconforming use unless the change is to a more restrictive use classification and a change in use from one nonprofit institution, permitted in zone R4, to another such institution, also permitted in zone R4, is merely a change to an equally restrictive use; moreover, such change does not entail a change to a more restrictive use classification since, although the use of the particular building as a Boys Town might not be permitted in zone R4, the use of a building as a Boys Town is permitted and thus the use of the premises before was one permitted in zone R4 and the use proposed is permitted in zone R4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Change in Use of Nonprofit Institution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A provision of the Buffalo Zoning Ordinance which governs changes in nonconforming uses is applicable to a proposed change of the program of a building from a Boys Town to an intermediate care facility for the developmentally disabled since, although a change from one type of nonprofit institution to another does not constitute a change in use classification under the ordinance, the proposed change would result in an increase in the intensity of supervision and activity and, therefore, does constitute a change in use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Input of Municipality into Site Selection of Intermediate Care Facility</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Buffalo Zoning Board's denial of a use permit for an intermediate care facility intended to house 30 developmentally disabled persons with 53 supervisory attendants on the ground that the proposed change in use violates the city's zoning ordinance does not contravene State policy favoring implementation of such facilities since the statutes which form the basis of that policy do not expressly or by any reasonable inference require that local law be disregarded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and, since it is the policy of the State as evidenced in section 41.34 of the Mental Hygiene Law to allow municipalities input into the site selection of all intermediate care facilities which are to house 4 to 14 mentally disabled persons (14 NYCRR 681.3 [c]), a municipality must have at least as much input into a facility intended to house 30 developmentally disabled persons and 53 supervisory attendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Religion -- Constitutional Protection of Use Instituted by Religious Society</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Buffalo Zoning Board's denial of a use permit for an intermediate care facility for the developmentally disabled does not unconstitutionally interfere with petitioner Diocese of Buffalo's religious function because constitutional protection is afforded only to religious uses, not all uses instituted by a religious society and petitioner's proposed use is not religious, since it is not simply ancillary or accessory to a traditionally religious use by petitioner, but solely charitable and therefore subject to the same regulations as any other charitable organization.  </SPAN></P>

However, the service occurred on a Sunday. The husband filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, which was denied. The appellate division ordered a jurisdictional hearing on review of the supreme court's decision. The court reversed and granted the husband's motion to dismiss. The court held that N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 11 directed that Sunday service in a civil action was absolutely void for any and every purpose and service on the husband in a foreign state on a Sunday did not give the court jurisdiction even if Sunday service was not prohibited there. When service was authorized to be made outside New York it must be made in the foreign state or country as though that foreign state or country were New York. The court also held that the prohibition against Sunday service was not unconstitutional. The statute was not ambiguous and was related to its avowed purpose and there was a strong presumption of constitutionality to which the statute was entitled which had not been overcome by the wife.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter before the court involved a delinquency case in which respondent was charged with possession of a dangerous knife by a person under the age of 16 in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.05. Respondent raised several constitutional challenges to the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was arrested in a subway station after a police officer found an ordinary, unmodified kitchen knife tucked in respondent's waistband. Respondent was charged under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.05, which prohibited possession of a dangerous knife by a person under the age of 16. Respondent challenged the statute's constitutionality. The court held that the statute did not deny respondent due process of law as a finding of a violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.05 was the predicate to a dispositional hearing under Fam. Ct. Act &sect;&sect; 731, 746. Also, the statute's prohibition against a child's possession of a dangerous knife did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment as the legislature had the power to make certain rights unavailable to minors. The court, however, held that the portion of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.05 that referred to dangerous knives, and under which appellant had been charged, was void for vagueness. The statute failed to define what constituted a dangerous knife, and the prohibition itself was so essentially vague that it could only be remedied by inserting an intent requirement, which the court was not free to do. Thus, the petition against respondent was dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the petition against respondent because that portion of the penal statute that referred to dangerous knives, and under which she had been charged, was void for vagueness because it failed to give ready notice to children of the prohibited action and the vagueness of the statute was inseparably linked to the absence of unlawful intent.</SPAN></P>

Section 265.05 of the Penal Law which prohibits possession of a dangerous knife by a person under the age of 16 has been consistently interpreted as incorporating the requirements of article 7 of the Family Court Act, so that a finding of a violation of section 265.05 is simply the predicate to a dispositional hearing pursuant to sections 731 and 746 of the Family Court Act to establish that a child charged with being a juvenile delinquent is, by a preponderance of the evidence, in need of supervision, treatment or confinement, and therefore the statute does not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

Any sharp knife is dangerous if used with intent to do harm, but without unlawful intent, the term dangerous is so vague as to make it impossible to know whether a knife may or may not be so described; thus, section 265.05 of the Penal Law, prohibiting possession of a dangerous knife by a person under the age of 16 without a showing of unlawful intent, is unconstitutionally vague and intertwined with a denial of equal protection of the law since unlawful intent is explicitly required before adults can be held criminally liable for possessing dangerous knives. Section 265.05 which fails to give notice as to what knives are prohibited can only be remedied by inserting a requirement of intent, and legislation may not be reworded by a court to remedy a flaw.</SPAN></P>

Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 230 occurred entitling the court to assert jurisdiction. The wife sought a judgment for obligations that accrued following the entry of the California judgment. In order to grant such relief, the court would have been required to make a finding that the husband failed to make certain payments and that the payments aggregated a specific sum of money for which a further judgment would have been entered. Thus, in personam jurisdiction was required.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Yonkers, N.Y., City Code &sect;&sect; 38.40, 38-44, provided that parties responsible for heating any building occupied as a home or a place of business had to heat such buildings to 70 degrees at all times when the street temperature was below 55 degrees during the day, and provided for civil and criminal fines and up to 10 days' imprisonment for violations. The court found that the burden imposed upon one asserting the unconstitutionality of a statute was heavy, that unconstitutionality had to be shown beyond a reasonable doubt, and that as a court of limited jurisdiction it should not set aside a statute unless a statute was facially invalid. The court denied the motion and found that the heating regulations were a valid exercise of the city's police power and that duties flowed from ownership of real property. The court ruled that the potential punishment associated with &sect; 38-44's criminal sanctions did not give defendant the right to a jury trial because they were violations pursuant to N.Y Penal Law &sect; 10.00(1), (3), and the right to a jury trial did not extend to crimes classified as less than misdemeanors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife and husband entered into a separation agreement in 1973, which was incorporated into a judgment of divorce the following year. At the time of the divorce judgment, the parties were residents of another state. Approximately six years later, the wife sought enforcement of provisions within the divorce decree, including child support arrearages owed by the husband. In particular, the wife requested the court make the judgment of the out-of-state court a judgment of a state court. On the wife's motion for summary judgment, filed in lieu of a complaint, the court stated the out-of-state decree was considered as a judgment of the state because the husband did not provide a reason why conversion should have been denied. The court also found the decree was not dormant because the wife had shown that she intended to keep the action alive. The court then held the wife was not collaterally estopped from bringing the action because the issue earlier considered by family court was distinct from the issue of her right to child support under the out-of-state decree.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff is permitted to convert a Georgia divorce decree, which incorporated the parties' separation agreement, into a New York judgment in the exercise of permissive full faith and credit, where there is no showing that this would be violative of defendant's rights or against the public policy of this State, notwithstanding the fact that the Georgia decree may be modifiable and nonfinal; the finality of a sister State decree is a condition precedent to its mandatory recognition in this State under the full faith and credit clause (US Const, art IV, &sect; 1), but is not a condition to permissive recognition.  Further, plaintiff's action to enforce the Georgia decree is not time barred by a provision of Georgia law that a bona fide effort to enforce the judgment and an entry of such effort on the execution docket be made within seven years of the judgment date or the judgment becomes dormant and unenforceable, as plaintiff's New York action was commenced within seven years of the judgment date and, despite her failure to enter the pendency of the instant action on the docket in Georgia, she has substantially&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  complied with the terms of the statute; plaintiff's action is also not barred by laches.</SPAN></P>

In granted the alleged father's motion to dismiss, the court held that the mother's allegations of fraudulent inducement were irrelevant because the statute limited acknowledgement to two forms: a writing or a showing of support. Because the mother had presented neither form of acknowledgement, her action was time-barred.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent mother filed a motion to dismiss petitioner putative father's complaint in his paternity action. The mother argued that the action was barred by the Statute of Limitations in N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 517(c), which she alleged was unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For four years, the putative father regularly supported and visited the child.

In denying the mother's petition to dismiss the paternity action, the court held that &sect; 517(c) was constitutional and that the paternity action could not be dismissed on the ground that the mother was not seeking support from the putative father. The reasonable basis to justify a different time for instituting a paternity proceeding for a father included: the putative father's knowledge of the child depended on being told by the mother and the putative father's objective to establish his right to visitation differed from the mother's objective to seek support. The putative father's paternity action was a separate proceeding that could cumulate in an order of filiation separate and apart from any order of support, visitation, or protections.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that the district court action had been adjourned pending criminal actions and that a judgment in the district court would not be dispositive of the issue. The court granted the motion to reargue and granted summary judgment in favor of the company and president. The statute was invalid as it attempted to alter the statutorily created powers of the district attorney. The state, by statutorily defining the rights and duties of a district attorney, preempted the possibility of local regulation relating to the duties of the office. While the district attorney was a constitutional officer chosen by the electors of a county, the duties of the office were prescribed by statute as opposed to the state constitution. The county could not, by local law, expand those duties in order to give the district attorney the power to litigate actions outside the scope of his duties as defined by statute. The court determined that the federal action, now stayed, would not adjudicate the validity of the local law and, thus, would not provide the company with an adequate remedy.

As a general rule, it is an abuse of discretion for a court to entertain jurisdiction of a declaratory judgment action when another action is pending in which all factual and legal issues can be determined but a declaratory judgment may not be refused because of the pendency of another suit if all legal and factual issues cannot be determined in such suit and a declaratory judgment action may be maintained notwithstanding the availability of another remedy where such remedy is not as adequate or effective; accordingly, plaintiffs' action to declare invalid a Suffolk County local law authorizing the District Attorney to prosecute civil actions under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) (US Code, tit 18, &sect; 1964, subd [c]) need not be dismissed because of the pendency of the county's Federal civil action against plaintiffs for treble damages in connection with the construction of a sewer project since all legal and factual issues will not be determined in the pending action and the remedy sought there is not as adequate or effective as that sought here inasmuch as plaintiffs' &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  counterclaim in the Federal action might not meet with much success.</SPAN></P>

An action to declare invalid a Suffolk County local law authorizing the District Attorney to prosecute civil actions under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) (US Code, tit 18, &sect; 1964, subd [c]), the county having brought a Federal RICO action against plaintiffs in connection with the construction of a county sewer project, need not be dismissed because of the failure to join the other defendants in the RICO action since the missing defendants are not indispensable parties ( CPLR 1001) inasmuch as their interests can be adequately protected by the instant plaintiffs nor should the action be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action since the issue of the power of the county legislature to enlarge the scope of the District Attorney's statutorily prescribed jurisdiction and duties presents a justiciable controversy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action against defendants, a town board and a municipality, concerning rate fixing, plaintiff sewage corporation sought an order for a declaratory judgment that certain sewage rates proposed by the corporation were fair and reasonable, a judgment pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and a judgment declaring N.Y. Transp. Corp. Law &sect; 121&nbsp;unconstitutional and ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sewage corporation made an application for a preliminary injunction establishing interim rates. The defendants contended that there was no authority to set interim rates nor to impose a one-time special assessment to recoup past unrealized revenues. The court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the sewage corporation because preliminary injunctive relief had to be granted when necessary to prevent intervening irreparable damage. Furthermore, the court reasoned that although a court had no rate-fixing power per se, it had the right and the duty to prevent the confiscation of the sewage corporation's property without due process of law. Finally, the court determined that a refusal of defendants to allow collection of even the amount it considered fair and reasonable under the guise of statutory sanction could bankrupt the sewage corporation and defeat the intended purpose of the enactment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion for an order suppressing the statements made by him because the statements were obtained during a custodial questioning on less than probable cause for arrest and were involuntary under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 60.45. Defendant was charged with the crime of manslaughter in the first degree. The statements were made after several polygraph tests were administered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was questioned about his whereabouts on the date that the victim was stabbed to death in her apartment. Each time, defendant told the same story. He had seen the victim that night, but then left the apartment. Defendant agreed to a lie detector test. The first test results were inconclusive, but the test giver told defendant that he had failed. Several subsequent tests were given, which defendant &quot;passed,&quot; although each time defendant was told that he had failed. Finally, after a lengthy custodial interrogation, defendant confessed. The court decided that the interrogation was without probable cause for arrest and had violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. Because of the close causal connection between the illegal seizure of defendant and the subsequent &quot;confessions,&quot; the statements were suppressed. The seizure, because it was not supported by probable cause, was unreasonable. The same rule applied to the custodial interrogation. The confession was involuntary under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 60.45 because of the improper conduct that impaired defendant's mental condition. The court looked at the totality of the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner brought a paternity proceeding against the alleged father, who requested and paid for a blood grouping test. The results were admissible only to exclude him as the father, and the Commissioner requested a more sophisticated test. The alleged father did not object, but stated that he could not afford to pay for the second lab test. The court directed that the Commissioner pay for the second test, holding that it would not impose on the alleged father the burden of paying for the production of evidence sought by the Commissioner. There was no requirement in N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 532 that the less expensive test be ordered first, and no requirement that the mother present evidence of a relationship with the alleged father before obtaining the more expensive test at his expense, but a totally innocent alleged father could be taxes with a substantial expense, over and above the cost of appearing in court and contesting the petition, and that was not the legislature's intent. The alleged father was a working man with a wife and two children and was significantly in debt because of medical expenses.

However, the church's petition was sufficient to raise the issue of whether the zoning code was applied unconstitutionally by alleging that the board's decision was affected by errors of law to the extent that it imposed unconstitutional restrictions on the church. The board's conclusions were arbitrary, irrational, and affected by errors. It made factual findings as to the increased traffic and noise, effect on use and enjoyment of the neighboring properties, aesthetics, change in character of the neighborhood, and diminished property values.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A defendant's motion for reargument and renewal that is supported by additional decisions and orders in the companion Federal litigation which were unavailable upon the defendant's original motion for summary judgment wherein it sought and was granted a declaration that a certain gross receipts tax on corporations doing business within the State is constitutional and validly enforceable for a limited time ending November 10, 1980, is granted to the extent that it seeks deletion of reference to the validity of the tax through November 10, 1980 only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed a suit against the State, challenging a retroactive franchise tax. The court denied the taxpayer summary judgment as to certain counts and granting summary judgment to the State to the extent of declaring the tax constitutional from its effective date through a certain date. The parties moved for reargument and renewal. The taxpayer sought to shorten the cessation date of the tax and oppose summary judgment to the State because the taxpayer's motion had been limited to certain counts; the State sought to lengthen the valid period from the effective date to the current date. The court granted the State's motion to the extent of lengthening the valid period because the tax was valid until there was a final order from the temporary emergency court of appeals or the federal supreme court; The court then held that the taxpayer's remaining counts were meritless. The tax did not violate the Import-Export Clause under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10(2) because it was not directed at imports based on their place of origin; further, the tax did not violate due process because its retroactive application for a short period was valid absent of proof of inequity to the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that there was a presumption of constitutionality to all legislation and that a party that attacked the constitutionality of laws must demonstrate the invalidity beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found (1) that &sect; 436 was not void for vagueness because it gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice as to what was required and what was forbidden; (2) that it met time, place, and scope guidelines and was not overbroad because the police commissioner did not have unfettered discretion to conduct administrative searches but rather was restricted to reasonable times by New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; B32-132.0(d); and (3) that auto junk yards were pervasively regulated businesses and that anyone who chose to engage in the business did so with the knowledge that the business was subject to inspection and supervision under the police power, so that consent to warrantless searches was implied.

The court, therefore, concluded that defendant's two prior felony convictions, subsequently reclassified as violent felonies, were properly considered predicate offenses to his being sentenced as a persistent violent felony offender. The court rejected defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of his first conviction.

The court granted the motion to convert the proceeding and declared that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 340.40(2) was constitutional. The court reasoned that the state had the right to limit the availability of jury trials to preserve the benefits that resulted from speedy and inexpensive nonjury adjudications. The court found that the statute's classification of a &quot;serious offense&quot; as one that was punishable by more than six months in prison was reasonable.

Law &sect;&sect; 84-90. When the ordered discovery was not completed the administratrix filed a motion to compel. The court granted the motion because the personnel records of a court officer was not entitled to the protection or benefits of the N.Y. Civ.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. According to section 50-a of the Civil Rights Law, a privilege does exist with respect to discovery of personnel records of police officers and correction officers but it does not extend to personnel records of court officers since they are not police officers by definition and though generally regarded along with correction officers as peace officers, the Legislature did not intend that that similarity entitle their records to be privileged from discovery; if the section 50-a privilege were made available to court officers, discovery of personnel records would still be available under certain circumstances upon the express written consent of the subject officer or as mandated by lawful court order or under the State's Freedom of Information Act (Public Officers Law, art 6, &sect;&sect; 84-90).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a male homosexual, was arrested after he solicited an undercover policeman on a public street. Defendant argued that &sect; 240.35(3) was unconstitutional because people had lawful right to engage in deviate sexual intercourse. He also contended that homosexuals had a right to associate with one another in public and one aspect of this right was the opportunity to make discreet inquiries of a prospective companion to have sex in private. The court found defendant guilty as charged. The court held that &sect; 240.35(3), as applied to male homosexuals, was constitutional. The court found that (1) male homosexuals who solicited in front of and near neighborhood residents' homes and businesses significantly interfered with the use and enjoyment and worth of the property of those in the neighborhood, and (2) there was a sufficient connection between the public's loss of the use and enjoyment of its streets, businesses, and homes and the activity at issue to warrant the ban. The court stated that the activity of homosexuals who loitered on the streets to solicit one another was akin to the loitering of prostitutes in its effect on the public.</SPAN></P>

The decedents' representatives opposed payment on grounds that a requirement of payment under &sect; 369(1)(b) would have represented a denial of equal protection of the laws in violation of provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, as they were transposed to N.Y. Const. art. I &sect; 11. The court held that there was no abridgement of the decedents' rights because they, from whom recoupment had been authorized by the state legislature, were not similarly circumstanced to those under 65 from whom recoupment was not permitted. Further, the court found that the legislature's classification, although made unknowingly, nonetheless had a reasonable basis.

Those convictions were vacated. However, those convictions had been admitted in a third case of drug dealing. The trial court permitted the district attorney to introduce evidence of prior convictions in the third case for three reasons: to demonstrate the predisposition of defendant to commit the crimes charged in the indictment, to attempt to overcome the entrapment defense raised; to demonstrate defendant possessed the requisite criminal intent, to attempt to overcome the agency defense raised; and to help establish the identity of defendant as the perpetrator of the crimes charged. The court held that the introduction at trial of the uncounseled convictions did not automatically warrant a reversal because the overwhelming evidence of guilt was decisive. The incredibility of defendant's testimony, the fact that defendant's testimony was discredited by other evidence, and the limited use of the uncounseled convictions at trial were sufficient to render the error harmless.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the compensation provisions of &sect; 183-a, which equated the salaries of certain district attorneys to those of a county court judge lacked a rational basis and must be declared unconstitutional. Therefore, the court held that the county was not obliged to pay the district attorney in accordance with the salary provisions of &sect; 183-a and N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 221-d.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had prior convictions for robbery in the second degree, a class C felony, and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, a class D felony.

The State argued that the instant charge of criminal possession of a weapon in the first degree coupled with the prior convictions for violent felonies required defendant to be sentenced to a maximum term of life imprisonment. The court held that insofar as N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.02 was retroactively applied to make offenses which at the time of commission were only felonies into violent felonies (for purposes of finding defendant a second violent felony offender or a persistent violent felony offender) it was unconstitutional as ex post facto and in violation of U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother, an unmarried airline flight attendant, lived with the father and thereafter saw him approximately once a year. Besides her testimony that she had sexual intercourse only with the father during the period for conception of the child, the blood-matching test showed the high probability of the father's paternity. The mother, before the parties had sexual intercourse, advised the father that she was using birth control pills, when she was not using them or any other contraception. However, she denied recollection of any question by the father about contraception. The court determined that the mother's planned and intentional deceit barred her from financial benefit at the father's expense. Thus, it was constitutional to deny her application for child support, provided that the basic objective of satisfying the child's fair and reasonable needs could have nevertheless been met.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On a motion for summary judgment, plaintiff express bus companies asked the court to declare that defendant city and related officials had violated the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions by selectively enforcing the utility tax, New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; QQ46-1.0(10). The city's cross-motion asserted tax deficiencies, argued a rational basis for the tax, and cited pending administrative actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; QQ46-1.0 (10) imposed a utility tax on the revenue derived by bus companies solely within the city; but limited fare bus companies were excluded from the tax. In practice, the tax was imposed on express bus companies and not on non-express bus companies. The city then allowed both kinds of companies to raise their rates in excess of the fare limit imposed by the tax law but collected the tax only from the express bus companies. The express bus companies filed an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and under the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The city argued that there was a rational basis for its application of the tax and that the express bus companies were bound by administrative review. The court disagreed. To challenge a specific assessment, the administrative hearing was an appropriate forum. To challenge a taxing authority's jurisdiction on the grounds of a statute's unconstitutionality, the court was the correct forum. Review of the legislative history of the statute in light of the highly unequal application of the law proved a discriminatory motive. The court granted judgment for the bus companies.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the express bus companies' motion for summary judgment and enjoined tax enforcement against them.</SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 217. The property owners possessed real property within the village and requested a declaratory judgment that the water rate structure passed by the village board of trustees was void and ineffective and to restrain its enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village had not board of water commissioner, but the activities of such a board were carried out by the village board of trustees by simple resolution. The property owners brought the declaratory judgment action after the village board of trustees at a special meeting increased the water rate. Defendants claimed that the four-month statute of limitations of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 217 was applicable and therefore that the action was untimely filed. The court disagreed and denied defendants motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. The court held that N.Y. C.P.L.R. 217 was not applicable. The court held that the village's action, whether labeled as a resolution or otherwise, completely altered the water rate structure for the entire village on a permanent basis, and the fixing of rates was a legislative act not subject to review by way of a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding. The court further held that the action was governed by the statute of limitations in N.Y. C.P.L.R. 213(1) and that the action was therefore timely commenced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was transferred in May 1978.

The 30-day period expired and no motion was made in the supreme court to remand the case and the decision was never appealed. The court held that with the failure of compliance with N.Y. C.P.L.R. 1012(b) and N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 71 the constitutionality of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 325(d) was not fully tested by inasmuch as it deprived the Attorney-General an opportunity to intervene in support of the constitutionality of that statute; therefore, the courts April 1981 decision was null and void. The court denied the motion, holding that: (1) the matter must be retained as a transfer pursuant to Rule 325(d) with the amount of recovery limited to that demanded in the complaint; and (2) N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 15(d) related to those actions initiated and originating in the lower court and that section was not applicable to cases transferred to the court pursuant to N.Y. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Commissioner of Social Services, filed an action seeking support from respondent husband for his wife and unborn child. The husband alleged that he was not the father of the unborn child and requested, pursuant to N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 418, a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) blood grouping test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that pursuant to a recent amendment to &sect; 418, 1981 N.Y.

The court further noted that the amendment failed to address the issue of who was responsible for the payment for such test. The husband contended that N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 418, as amended, was unconstitutional in that the payment provisions as applied to the husband were discriminatory and denied equal protection of the law in that they were gender based and not based on an important governmental objective nor substantially related to an important governmental objective. The court rejected the husband's contention, holding that &sect; 418, as amended, was constitutional. The court granted the husband's request of the HLA test and determined that the husband was financially able to contribute towards the cost of the test.

The payment provisions of section 418 as applied to the respondent are constitutional and do not deny equal protection of the law in that they are gender based and not based on or substantially related to an important governmental objective; the purpose of the statute is not to provide a means by which a respondent can be cleared of a false claim of paternity, but rather the discretion given the court in allowing the test and determining whether its results should be received in evidence indicates a legislative purpose of protecting the children of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  parties from spurious claims of a father designed to avoid or delay paying support, a legitimate governmental objective, particularly where, as here, mother and child are recipients of public assistance. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff board of education filed a motion for summary judgment in its declaratory judgment action challenging changes in New York statutes that affected the funding of the state's health insurance fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Various boards of education filed a declaratory judgment action seeking to withdraw from the state's health insurance fund (HIRRF) and claiming that the impact of a new statutory scheme designed to fund the state's employee health insurance fund was to force a school district to remain in the state health insurance plan or be faced with a &quot;two-fold&quot; decrease in their state aid occasioned by a reduction in aid equal to the HIRRF funds and by the state withholding moneys to repay the amount of the school district's default. The court held that another statute, enacted the same day as the funding statute, did not effectively repeal the funding statute. The court noted that no cogent reason was advanced for the application of the middle tier scrutiny, and therefore the case should have been determined after due inquiry as to whether there was a rational basis for the distinction between school districts which remained in the health plan after March 25, 1977 and those who withdrew prior to that date.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapter 55 of the Laws of 1977 (State Finance Law, &sect; 99-c), which provides for the withholding of State aid upon the failure of municipalities or school districts to repay moneys advanced from the health insurance reserve receipts fund (HIRRF), was not repealed by implication by chapter 71 (&sect; 8, subd b) of the Laws of 1977, which was enacted on the same day and provides for a reduction in State aid to school districts electing after March 25, 1977 not to receive such funds in the amount of the distribution they would have received and for an annual reduction in aid to those districts receiving HIRRF moneys; in fact, the enactments indicate a harmony of purpose, since chapter 71 provides for a loss of State aid if the school district does not accept a distribution from the HIRRF, thereby placing that body in no better position than one who accepts the distribution and, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 55, is later required to return some or all of that portion of the aid it represents.  Further, summary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judgment is inappropriate on the constitutional challenge addressed to the distinction drawn between school districts that elect not to participate in the insurance plan prior to March 25, 1977 and suffer no reduction in State aid and those which so elect after said date and have their State aid reduced; accordingly, the matter should be determined after due inquiry as to whether there was a rational basis for the distinction.  </SPAN></P>

The court found that the term &quot;deviate sexual intercourse&quot; was defined only once in the Penal Law and that was as certain types of sexual conduct between persons not married to one another. Therefore, the court concluded that what is proscribed &sect; 240.35, subd. 3, was loitering involving parties not married to one another.The court held that &sect; 240.35, subd. 3, was unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in that it prohibited such conduct between unmarried persons but not married persons. The court also found that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because, by allowing the police wide discretion in implementing the statute, it encouraged arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first degree robbery, second degree robbery, first degree criminal use of a firearm, and fourth degree criminal use of a weapon. At defendant's arraignment, the State brought an oral motion for an order authorizing the in-court seizure of defendant's sneakers. Defendant opposed the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that the sneakers were required for the purpose of enabling the police department to make a comparison with a sneaker print left atop a bank counter at the crime scene. Defendant argued that the proper procedure for seizing the sneakers as evidence was by written demand to produce pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 240.30, that it was not the proper function of the court to assist the State in preparing and prosecuting the case, and that the seizure would have been violative of defendant's Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. The court rejected defendant's contentions and granted the State's motion. The court said that, in light of the existence of exigent circumstances, in-court seizure of the sneakers was appropriate. The court noted that &sect; 240.30 was inapplicable because it permitted discovery on demand only where a defendant was charged by indictment, superior court information, prosecutor's information, or information. The statute was not available to the State in the instant matter because defendant was charged by felony complaint and was awaiting possible felony hearing or grand jury consideration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court, upon the prosecutor's arraignment-stage oral application, may properly order the postarrest, preindictment in-court seizure of defendant's sneakers without a written demand to produce ( CPL 240.30) for comparison with a sneaker &quot;print&quot; allegedly left atop a bank counter during the commission of the robbery since, given both the urgency of the seizure and its in-court nature, any court-imposed requirement that the People proceed by written search warrant to seize evidence in plain view is inappropriate inasmuch as such an application would impede the truth-finding function by exposing potentially admissible evidence to loss or alteration; the seizure order in open court did not constitute improper judicial assistance to the People in preparing and prosecuting the case against defendant; the seizure of defendant's sneakers falls outside the scope of Fifth Amendment guarantees against self incrimination since the seizure does not involve testimonial compulsion nor did the seizure violate defendant's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures since&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant had no logical expectation of privacy. </SPAN></P>

Not-For-Profit Corp. Law &sect; 511. Prior to the petition, the seller commenced an action for specific performance of the contract but different appraisals of the property were submitted. The court held a hearing on evidence offered by the church, the purchaser, and another potential buyer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seller, pursuant to &sect; 511, which provided that a religious corporation could not sell any real property without leave of court, submitted an application for approval of a contract to sell a building to the purchaser for $ 2 million, with an amendment for an additional $ 200,000 to be paid by the purchaser if the transfer occurred by a specific date. The purchaser filed an action for specific performance and a hearing was held. Upon review of the petition, the court approved the amended petition and ordered for the transfer of title to the purchaser. The court held that the Not-For-Profit Corporation law set forth two issues to be considered by the court: (1) the fairness and reasonableness of the terms of the transaction, and (2) whether the sale would benefit the petitioner or promote the interests of its members. The court, after evaluating the appraisal reports and testimony related to other offers, ruled that the offer by the purchaser was within the range of the fair market value of the property and that the conveyance would benefit the parish because the property was underutilized and been shown to many other prospective purchasers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted on charges of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. The weapon was a .12 gauge Browning semiautomatic shotgun loaded with four live rounds. Both the barrel and the stock had been cut down. The barrel was 13 3/8 inches in length and the over-all length was 26 3/8 inches. Both defendants were 5 feet 4 inches tall. The primary question on defendants' motion to inspect the grand jury minutes was what size a sawed-off shotgun had to be before it qualified as a prohibited &quot;firearm&quot; under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.00(3). Defendants claimed that the statute was unconstitutionally vague, and that the evidence before the grand jury was insufficient as a matter of law to show that the weapon in question was capable of being concealed upon the person. The court concluded that the law in New York as to the concealability of sawed-off shotguns was unclear. Therefore, the grand jury minutes were legally insufficient to establish concealability with respect to each of defendants and the indictment was therefore dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A previous reapportionment case that involved the board had proceeded through the New York courts and the United States Supreme Court. The board had adopted a resolution that provided for five legislative districts based upon the existing boundaries of five towns, with each town to elect a varying number of legislators based upon their respective populations. Although the plan permitted a total voting inequality of 11.9 percent, it was approved by all of the courts that considered it. It changed each time census results were published. When the changes required by the census results were made the total voting inequality had increased to 29.3 percent. Plaintiffs sought to prevent the election and to have the court impose a plan of reapportionment or order the board to produce one. The court granted plaintiffs summary judgment to the extent that the plans were unconstitutional violations, ordered the board to produce a constitutional plan, but allowed the election to proceed because there was no effective method of timely relief.

A plan to implement court-ordered reapportionment of county legislative districts, which was passed by resolution of the county board of supervisors following court disapproval of the board's original proposal 10 days prior to the effective date of section 10 (subd 1, par [ii], cl a, subcl [13]) of the Municipal Home Rule Law, which permits the county to reapportion itself subject to a permissive referendum, is not subject to section 10 (subd 1, par [ii], cl a, subcl [13]), section 23 (subd 2, pars f, g) or section 24 (subd 2, par j) of the Municipal Home Rule Law, is valid under subdivision 2 of section 22 of that law and, further, does not deprive plaintiffs taxpayers of a franchise right, to wit, the right to vote at a referendum; as of the effective date of the legislation calling for a permissive referendum, the judicial process which culminated in the approval of the resolution was extant and the court had already disapproved one reapportionment plan and, in addition, although section 23 of the Municipal Home Rule Law required a mandatory referendum thereon, the final plan, which was approved by the court and was affirmed in all&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  New York appellate courts and in the United States Supreme Court, did not so provide.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A court-approved formula for reapportionment of county legislative districts that attempts to preserve traditional town boundaries within the county and which, as originally adopted, resulted in an 18-member legislature and an 11.9% total voting inequality deviation, but results in a 26.4% deviation for an 18-member legislature when applied to 1980 census figures and a deviation of 29.3% for a 20-member legislature, violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and sections 1 and 11 of article I of the New York Constitution; however, although the plan is constitutionally unacceptable, the court will not enjoin the imminent election of a 20-member legislature, nor will it mandate that the county adopt a specific alternate plan without affording the legislators an additional opportunity to discharge this obligation themselves.  Accordingly, the county legislature is ordered to adopt a plan of reapportionment which will comply with constitutional standards within 90 days.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagee alleged that the city's claim of title was a nullity, so such claim could not defeat the action to foreclose the mortgage. The court granted summary judgment to the city, dismissing the complaint. The court determined that notice requirements were in conformity with constitutional due process. The court concluded that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was not entitled to have tax bills or notice of foreclosure action mailed to it because of its failure to register its interest in the property. The court noted that the city did not violate due process requirements because the recording of the deed under the old block designation should have brought realization to any interested party that the subject premises could be involved and affected. Therefore, the city's error in recording the tax foreclosure deed was not of such magnitude as to mislead a person making a diligent title search. The court determined that the right to foreclose vested before the FDIC held the mortgage lien and thus the foreclosure could nullify the lien, so the assignment from the FDIC to the mortgagee conveyed nothing more than a nonexistent mortgage.</SPAN></P>

The issue before the court was whether &sect;&sect; 966 (1976), 55 (1979), and 881 (1980) violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and state constitutions by providing the former and present judges lower salaries than granted to other judges of the same courts performing identical duties.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Unified Court Budget Act (L 1976, ch 966; L 1979, ch 55; L 1980, ch 881) violates the equal protection clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions insofar as plaintiffs, 109 named Judges who hold or held the positions of Family, County and/or Surrogate Court Judge in various counties throughout the State, are provided lower salaries than granted to other Judges of the same courts performing similar duties, and plaintiffs are entitled to receive retroactive salary payments from April 1, 1977 to the present in order to correct the disparity. Pursuant to the Unified Court Budget Act, it was provided that, commencing April 1, 1977, salaries of Family, County and Surrogate Court Judges would be placed on the State payroll and judicial personnel henceforth would be State employees (L 1976, ch 966, &sect; 2, adding Judiciary Law, former &sect; 220, subd 6, renum &sect; 39, subd 6); the differences in pay attributable to local government discretion and funding prior to the takeover were continued and the disparity increased by subsequent legislation (L 1979, ch 55; L 1980, ch 881).  The basis for classification of salaries contained in the Unified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Court Budget Act is purely a vestige of local politics unrelated in a rational manner to population, case load, jurisdiction or any other relevant criteria; moreover, no legitimate governmental objective is advanced by the classification, which directly contravenes the purpose behind the movement to a unified court system and the enactment of a unified court budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Proper Parties</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action to declare a judicial salary plan enacted by the Legislature unconstitutional, the Supreme Court lacks jurisdiction of a claim for money damages against the State, and a claim against the State Comptroller should be dismissed; however, the State is a proper party to an action to declare a statute unconstitutional, and, therefore, the Chief Administrator of the Courts is an appropriate party to an action by Judges to declare a legislative classification to be in violation of the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner village commenced a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding that sought to vacate the imposition of real estate taxes levied by respondent town and its officials upon an approximately five-acre parcel of property located in the village. The village further sought that it be granted an exemption from real estate taxes, and to stop any tax sale of the real estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a preliminary issue on personal service, the court determined that although personal service upon a town could be obtained by service on the supervisor or clerk pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 311(5), a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding could be commenced by an order to show cause pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7804(c), and notice could be given in the manner specified by the court pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 2214(d). Service was properly made pursuant to an order to show cause issued by a justice of the supreme court. Although the acreage at issue was initially taken by the village's condemnation proceedings, the condemnation was set aside upon application of a mortgagee, which order in turn was reversed by the appellate division. The court held that when the condemnation was first set aside the property did not revert to the prior owner's non-exempt use, because the order of the appellate division would have dated back to time from which the order was appealed; that is, the intervening order that set aside the condemnation was void, and in no way affected the village's title or their tax exempt ownership of the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the village's action that sought to vacate the imposition of real estate taxes against it by the town, the court canceled all such taxes assessed and the property at issue was stricken from the assessment rolls of the town.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowners filed a motion for summary judgment and to strike defendants' answer in an action seeking a declaratory judgment to void the Ramapo Town Zoning Local Law &sect; 376-33.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowners filed a suit against defendants, a town and the town board, alleging that the Ramapo Town Zoning Local Law &sect; 376-33 was in violation of N.Y. Town Law &sect; 262. However, defendants claimed that N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 10(1)(ii)(d)(3) granted defendants the ability to amend or supersede the provisions of N.Y. Town Law. The court found that the provisions of the Ramapo Town Zoning Local Law &sect; 376-33 were inconsistent with the provisions of N.Y. Town Law &sect; 262. Further, &sect; 376-33 violated N.Y. Town Law because it did not apply uniform regulations for two-family semiattached residences within the R-15 district or for uniform regulation of the same structures throughout the remainder of defendants' R-15 districts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment because there were no triable issues of fact as defendants did not have the authority to enact a town law inconsistent with the provisions of another town law. The court submitted judgment on the notice declaring the zoning local law void and illegal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A town zoning law, which authorizes the erection of two-family, semiattached residences in one portion of the town's R-15 districts but makes no similar provision for the other R-15 districts in the town, is void, since the provisions of the zoning law are &quot;inconsistent&quot; with the provisions of section 262 of the Town Law, which requires that a zoning ordinance be uniform throughout a district, and a town lacks the power to enact local zoning laws that are inconsistent with the general laws of the State; the State has specifically circumscribed a town's zoning power by requiring uniformity both within and throughout identical zoning districts and absent an express statutory delegation, a town lacks the power to enact, amend or enforce zoning or other land use regulations and it must strictly adhere to the State-wide statutory zoning mandate; the power delegated to local governments to enact local laws which relate to their &quot;property, affairs or government&quot; (Municipal Home Rule Law, &sect; 10, subd 1, par [ii], cl d, subcl [3]) does not constitute a delegation of authority to the local government to enact zoning&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  regulations and therefore does not grant respondent town the power to amend or supersede the provisions of the Town Law which relate to zoning. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court could not agree with the contention of the residents and dismissed the complaint. The court found that the statute complied with the constitutional mandate of N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 1. The court determined that the state constitutional classifications based on size and nature of the municipalities and school districts were not of the suspect type and, the appropriate standard being the rational basis test, a rational basis existed for the differences in classifications between a city school district and a noncity school district. The court found that the mere existence of voter approval or disapproval did not necessarily guarantee that a student would be provided the right to participate in interscholastic sports, additional library programs, marching band activities, etc. The court concluded that such activities or programs were not required by statute to be provided and the decision to make such additional activities available was discretionary with each individual board of education.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Section 2023 of the Education Law, which specifies that in the event the voters refuse to vote the sums estimated to be necessary for teachers' salaries or &quot;ordinary contingent&quot; expenses, then the board of education may levy a tax for same, is not an unconstitutional delegation of taxing powers to a school district in violation of section 1 of article XVI of the New York State Constitution; a tax may be levied for legal obligations of the district and those items necessary to maintain the educational program, preserve property and assure the health and safety of the students and staff.  Moreover, the classifications based on size and nature of the municipalities and school districts set forth in section 10 of article VIII of the New York State Constitution are not inherently suspect so as to require utilization of the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard of review; the appropriate standard is the rational basis test and a rational basis exists&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to justify the distinction between sections 2516 to 2519 of the Education Law, where city school districts are allowed to appropriate funds and levy taxes for &quot;ordinary contingent&quot; expenses without voter approval, while under section 2023, noncity school districts require voter approval. Nor does section 2023 amount to a deprivation of due process and a denial of plaintiffs' right to an education, since the mere existence of voter approval or disapproval does not necessarily guarantee that a student will be provided the right to participate in activities such as interscholastic sports, marching band and additional library programs, which are not statutorily required.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of making a $ 3,500 loan at an interest rate of approximately 208 percent per annum. He filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that prosecution under this statute violated the constitution. The trial court denied the motion in all respects. It held that he had failed to meet his burden of demonstrating the unconstitutionality of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 190.40 beyond a reasonable doubt. The court used the rational basis test. It could not say that treating this defendant differently from a large corporate lending institution was wholly irrelevant to achievement of the statute's objectives. As there were valid state objectives and a rational basis for distinguishing between the two classes of lenders, defendant's constitutional attack based on equal protection was rejected. The court held that no fundamental sense of justice had been denied the defendant by subjecting him to prosecution. In affirming, the court held that merely subjecting a defendant to a possible hard result based upon the legislation involved did not constitute any violation or deprivation of any of fundamental, statutory or constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had multiple sclerosis. Defendant filed a motion to show cause seeking to have the temporary protection order vacated or modified.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CPL 530.12, which empowers the court in a criminal proceeding involving certain family offenses to issue a temporary order of protection without a prior hearing, is not constitutionally defective since the temporary order of protection is issued as a condition of bail or pretrial release and requiring that a hearing be held before any such issuance would be onerous, impractical and in most instances inappropriate; a defendant's right to due process is adequately protected since a defendant who is the object of a temporary order of protection may at any time request a hearing for the purpose of determining the merits of such an order notwithstanding that such a procedure is not specifically provided for in the statute; accordingly, in order to avoid an injustice under the circumstances, the temporary order of protection directing defendant, a victim of multiple sclerosis who is charged with assaulting his wife, to stay away from his home, which is equipped with special facilities to accommodate his physical incapacity, is modified to the extent of permitting defendant to re-enter his own residence without interference.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant is not a proper party to raise the constitutionality of the statute as applied to third persons, i.e., the juvenile performers, since he is not a member of the class of child performers, nor does the record warrant the conclusion that he is entitled to any representative standing, inasmuch as there is no agency relationship between defendant and the child performers, nor does defendant appear to have any personal, parental or substantial economic relation to any child performer. </SPAN></P>

The court found that there was no allegation that the legislature acted in an impermissible or unconstitutional manner in enacting the HLA legislation and therefore deferred to the legislative determination on the reliability of the HLA test and did not engage in further scrutiny of the procedure's scientific reliability. The court held that the HLA test did not violate the Fourth Amendment's right to privacy or the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination. The court also determined that &sect; 532 mandated that the putative father pay for the test because he was not indigent. The court recognized that making the putative father bear the cost of the HLA test led to inequitable results, but the court concluded that &sect; 532 mandated that he pay for the test because he was not indigent.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A motion by the Commissioner of Social Services, as the assignee of petitioner mother, for an order directing the mother, her child, who was born out of wedlock, and respondent putative father to submit to a Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) blood tissue test pursuant to section 532 of the Family Court Act is granted; the statute leaves no discretion in the court to deny motions by either party for such tests.  Further, respondent's challenge to said HLA test on the grounds that it is not sufficiently reliable and that submission to the test violates his right to privacy under the Fourth Amendment and his privilege against self incrimination under the Fifth Amendment is dismissed; the court will defer to the legislative determination on the reliability of the HLA blood test and must also reject respondent's constitutional objections, since the minimal privacy intrusion involved is justified by the significant State interest in the welfare of children born out of wedlock and the blood test does not implicate the Fifth Amendment privilege, which is limited to criminal cases.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 532 of the Family Court Act, when amended to allow the Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) blood tissue test into evidence to aid in the determination of whether the alleged father is or is not the father of a child, was otherwise unchanged and, therefore, the existing provision that the cost of a blood grouping test be borne by respondent putative father unless he is indigent is also applicable to the HLA amendment; while it was fair to have a nonindigent putative father bear the cost of the original standard blood grouping test permitted by the statute, since it was only admissible to exclude the respondent as the father, the apparent oversight in the amendment of the statute may lead to the inequitable result that respondent will have to pay for the newer HLA blood test, which must be ordered on the mother's motion for said test and is admissible as evidence that respondent is the father.  However, upon the consent of the movant Commissioner of Social Services, petitioner mother's assignee, the cost of said test will be borne equally by the nonindigent respondent and the Department of Social Services.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss an indictment charging defendant with the crimes of robbery in the third degree and grand larceny in the second degree based upon an alleged lack of speedy trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The period of time elapsed from the issuance of a warrant of arrest and the announcement by the People of their readiness for trial totaled 269 days. This was three months past the six-month standard required by N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect; 30.30, 210.20(1)(g). However, from the time the arrest warrant was issued in August 1980 and this final arrest in February 1981, defendant's whereabouts were unknown as he was avoiding apprehension. Also, the police were unable to determine his location by due diligence. The court made the factual finding that the period of delay related to the defendant's voluntary absence from the local jurisdiction was excluded under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 30.30(4)(c) as the delay was caused by the absence or unavailability of defendant. Accordingly, the People was regarded as being ready for trial within the six-month provisions of &sect; 30.30(1)(a). On a further motion to reargue its decision, the court ordered a rehearing to determine whether the police exercised due diligence in attempting to locate defendant. If so, the prior holding that such period was chargeable to defendant would remain in effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment, but subsequently granted his motion for a rehearing on his unavailability.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the ordinance lacked a rational purpose in permitting occupancy in one instance based upon the relationship of the occupants and in another based upon attainment of a certain age. The court held that the effect of the ordinance was to discriminate in the occupancy of one-family housing solely on the basis of age. The court directed that the ordinance was not enforceable against two unrelated persons who resided in a one-family dwelling as a single housekeeping unit within the town's unincorporated areas. The court also found that the ordinance conflicted with N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 296(5)(a)(1), which prohibited discrimination in housing on the basis of marital status.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because of lack of evidence, the court rejected the petitioner allegation that a closed executive session prior to adopting, by majority vote in open session, a resolution authorizing the sale of county-owned lands violated the Open Meetings Law, N.Y. Pub. Off. Law art. 7. The permissible limited judicial review of legislative acts did not permit the court to substitute its judgment for that of the legislature as to the price or the adequacy of the consideration for the bona fide sale of the properties. The lack of a legislative resolution stating that the property was no longer needed for public purposes was not void for violation of N.Y. County Law &sect; 215 as the county operated under an optional or alternative form of county government. The county legislature did not meet the legal requirement of determining that its action had no environmental significance on the area merely by passing a local law authorizing the sale of the county-owned property.

The fact that the Orange County Legislature improperly conducted a closed 30-minute executive session prior to adopting by majority vote in open session a resolution authorizing the sale of county-owned property pursuant to a local law is an insufficient ground to annul the action taken by the legislature since, although it has not been demonstrated that publicity would have substantially affected the value of the property so as to justify the closed executive session under the Open Meetings Law (Public Officers Law, &sect; 100, subd 1, par h), petitioner legislator has failed to prove that good cause exists to invoke the granting of judicial relief (Public Officers Law, &sect; 102) nor has sufficient proof been presented that improper informal private meetings occurred to such an extent as to place the validity of the legislative process in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Limited Review of Legislative Acts -- Sale of County-Owned Property</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The court cannot review the question of whether the Orange County Legislature properly placed a resolution authorizing the sale of certain county-owned property&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the legislative agenda after the legislative session had commenced since the placing of items on the agenda is within the exclusive prerogative of the legislature and the court cannot interject itself into the internal procedures of the legislature or review the acts of another co-ordinate and equal department of government; the permissible limited judicial review of legislative acts does not permit the court to substitute its judgment for that of the legislature as to the price or the adequacy of the consideration for the bona fide sale of the subject parcel of property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Counties -- Private Sale of County Property</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A local law adopted by the Orange County Legislature which authorizes the county to conduct private negotiations for the sale of certain county-owned property without public bid and without the necessity of a legislative resolution stating that the property is no longer needed for public purposes is not void for violating section 215 of the County Law since Orange County is operating under an optional or alternative form of county government and, thus, its local law supersedes the provisions of the County Law which are in conflict with it (County Law, &sect;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2, subd [b]).</SPAN></P>

Orange County did not comply with the requirements to the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) and the regulations promulgated thereunder ( ECL 8-0113, subd 3, par [a]; 6 NYCRR 617.12 [b]) when it determined that the proposed sale of more than 100 contiguous acres of county-owned land did not require an environmental impact statement without identifying the relevant areas of environmental concern or making a reasoned elaboration of the basis for its determination that the proposed sale would have no &quot;significant&quot; environmental effect on the area; accordingly, the proposed sale is stayed pending compliance with the applicable provisions of SEQRA and a final determination by the appropriate county authorities as to the environmental significance of the proposed sale. </SPAN></P>

The candidate challenged provisions of N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 58 as unconstitutional and invalid. The commissioner moved for summary judgment. The state attorney general intervened and sought judgment dismissing the petition with regard to the constitutional challenge. The court found that the commissioner refused to put the candidate's name on the eligibility list for two reasons: age and place of residence. The court found that N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 58(1) precluded appointment of police officer candidates more than 29 years of age. The candidate reached his 29th birthday but was not yet 30. The court held that the candidate should be considered 29 until his next birthday, and that he fell within the age limitations of the statute. The court also held that the durational residency requirement imposed on civil service applicants by a county rule penalized nonresidents without adequate justification and violated the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The statutory mandate did not require a hearing. The court held that the directive in &sect; 3450(4)(a) was clear and unqualified in that a license should be revoked upon the holder's conviction of a felony. The conviction constituted an abridgement of the license automatically terminating its duration. The statute struck a balance in favor of the public's right to rest assured that its funeral directors were individuals of moral integrity in whom they could place their confidence and trust.

The inmate cited a case wherein the natural parent was notified and advised of her legal rights to determine whether or not she wished to oppose a petition.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Near the end of trial in the contested paternity case, legislation became effective authorizing the admission into evidence in family court paternity proceedings of the HLA test. The court determined that the HLA test results were in the nature of rebuttal evidence that would have been particularly appropriate because of its independence from the conflicting testimony. The court determined that the HLA test was constitutional. The court explained that there was no evidence that was comparable to an HLA test in effectiveness to prove paternity. The court noted that the HLA test involved only the withdrawal of a small amount of blood from the alleged fathers. The court concluded that a justification for the imposition of the HLA test was the state's deep, persuasive, and abiding interest in the welfare of its children. The court explained that the slight intrusion on individual privacy resulting from the HLA test was justified by the public interest in reliable evidence of paternity, both for the sake of child welfare and of conservation of public assistance funds, and it was also justified by the interest in equality of discovery devices for both parties in paternity litigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that because the appointment of the supervising judge of the Criminal Branch of the Superior Courts in Suffolk County was not properly filed with the office of the Secretary of State of New York, that the judge's assignment of his case to the court should be declared null and void. The court disagreed and held that N.Y. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8 did not set forth any &quot;textual commitment&quot; which required the judiciary to file rules or regulations made in the course of its operation and administration of New York State's Unified Court System. The court noted that the chief administrative had determined that the designation of an individual as an administrative judge was neither an &quot;initial assignment of judicial personnel&quot; nor a &quot;substantive court procedure&quot; which needed to be filed under N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 22, &sect; 20.8, which was an internal &quot;housekeeping&quot; rule. The administrator's powers regarding assignments were complete and needed no approval.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211(a)(7), defendant Town of North Hempstead (town) filed a motion to dismiss the complaint filed by plaintiff injured person, under which the injured person sought to recover damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained as a result of the negligence of the town in failing to inspect and prune a tree located in the public way.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured person sought to recover damages for personal injuries sustained when, while riding in a truck, he was struck by the branch of a tree located in the public way. He claimed that the town had allowed a nuisance and failed to take reasonable measures to avoid the claimed accident. The town argued that the action was barred due to the failure to comply with N.Y.  Town Code &sect; 26-1, which required actual written notice by the town as a condition precedent to a civil action for personal injury damages sustained in consequence of any highway, bridge, or culvert being defective, out-of-repair, unsafe, dangerous or obstructed. The court further held that that more relevant and applicable statute was N.Y. Town Code ch. 20A also know as Local Law No. 2-1978. The statute created in the town a specific duty concerning trees in or adjoining public rights of way in order to protect the public against tree-caused unsafe or hazardous conditions. N.Y.  Town Code &sect; 26-1 did not apply to defeat the claim merely because the tree was near a highway, bridge, or culvert. Therefore, the court denied the motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the town's motion to dismiss the injured person's complaint, under which the injured person sought damages for injuries allegedly sustained as a result of the town's negligence in failing to inspect and prune a tree located in the public way.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Trees on Public Way -- Nuisance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A local law wherein defendant town specifically assumes the duty to regulate and control all trees in or adjoining public rights of way in order to protect the public against tree-caused unsafe or hazardous conditions throughout the town, creates a specific duty owed to all persons, which duty is not contingent upon the town's prior receipt of written notice of such a condition, as it is required under another local statute where a defective or otherwise unsafe, dangerous or obstructed highway, bridge or culvert might be involved.  Accordingly, said highway provision cannot be made to apply so as to defeat a valid claim for personal injuries allegedly sustained as a result of the negligence of the defendant in failing to inspect and prune a tree located in the public way, thereby allowing a nuisance, simply because the offending tree happens to be near a highway, nor is lack of actual written notice to the town of the condition prior to plaintiff's accident fatal.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted criminal mischief and sentenced to a conditional discharge and a fine. He was brought before the court on a warrant when the fine remained unpaid. The state requested incarceration. The court found that defendant was indigent. Defendant sought either revocation of the fine pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 420.10(4)(c) or not to be resentenced to the possible prison term authorized under &sect; 420.10(4)(d).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence for his attempted criminal mischief conviction included a conditional discharge and a $ 250 fine. He failed to pay the fine and the state requested incarceration. After a hearing, the court concluded that defendant was indigent. Defendant then sought either total revocation of the fine under &sect; 420.10(4)(c) or not to be resentenced to the possible prison term authorized by &sect; 420.10(4)(d). It was not clear whether the conditional discharge was independent of the fine or whether the fine was a term of the discharge. The court held that in either instance vacating the entire fine or resentencing to a term of imprisonment was not proper. Therefore, the court lowered the amount of the fine pursuant to &sect; 420.10(4)(a) and resentenced defendant to a conditional discharge plus a $ 50 fine separate and apart therefrom. The court concluded that resentencing defendant to the original term of incarceration because of clear financial inability to pay would have been legally inequitable, constitutionally impermissible, and socially undesirable. Moreover, it would have been tantamount to the court sitting as an appellate court on the judgment of the sentencing judge.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, defendant is resentenced to a conditional discharge plus a lower fine, separate and apart from said discharge.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with the violation of Town of Smithtown, N.Y., Code &sect;&sect; 54-12(A), 54-140(3), which prohibited the use of portable signs in filling stations. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 170.35(1)(c), and alleged that the offense charged was unconstitutional or otherwise invalid. The town submitted no opposing papers to the motion, apparently relying on the presumption that a statute was constitutional until proven otherwise beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant's main claim was that the ordinance was discriminatory and was an unconstitutional regulation of commercial free speech as protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The court noted that only filling stations had a prohibition against portable signs. The court found that a repair shop could have a portable sign, and since the main difference between the two activities was the retail sale of gasoline, the court concluded that the ordinance was an unconstitutional restriction on protected commercial speech aimed specifically at retail gasoline price information.</SPAN></P>

The county filed a motion for an order granting summary judgment and dismissing the complaint and cross- claims against the county. Plaintiff, the MTA, and the MSBA filed cross-motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a handicapped person, alleged that after he boarded a bus with a half-fare identification card issued by the City of New York, the bus driver refused to honor the card and had plaintiff arrested and prosecuted for theft of services. After the charges were dismissed, plaintiff filed an action against the county under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 based on an alleged &quot;policy&quot; which deprived plaintiff of his constitutional rights. The court determined that plaintiff failed to show that the county had a policy that proximately caused the alleged incident. The court found that a policy of charging full fare to handicapped non-county residents could not be a proximate cause of the incident, that there was no proof that the county had a policy of enforcing its regulation by causing non-county bus riders to be arrested, that plaintiff had not even demonstrated that the county had jurisdiction or undertook to formulate such a policy with regard to buses, and that an &quot;official policy&quot; could not be inferred from a single incident. The court did not grant the county's motion for summary judgment in order to permit plaintiff to take oral depositions of county supervisory employees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the county's motion for summary judgment with leave to renew the motion at the conclusion of depositions of its supervisory employees.

As defendant exited the car and began walking away, a police officer called to him. Defendant then began to run, and the police officer pursued him. The police officer followed defendant's footprints into an apartment building and found him in an unlocked apartment. The police officer placed defendant under arrest. Defendant physically attempted to prevent his arrest. Defendant was subsequently charged with operating an unregistered vehicle and with resisting arrest. Defendant moved to dismiss the resisting arrest charge, and the court granted the motion. Pursuit was justified only if a police officer was endeavoring to complete the arrest of an individual the officer had probable cause to believe had committed or was about to commit a crime.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where a police officer attempts to question a suspect in regard to a traffic infraction, the suspect flees and is followed into an apartment by the officer, and while being placed under arrest, pushes the officer, a charge of resisting arrest cannot be sustained since a search or seizure carried out on a suspect's premises without a warrant is per se unreasonable, absent exigent circumstances; although hot pursuit of a suspect is such a circumstance, it is only justified when the suspect is fleeing the scene of a crime, and neither flight from the attempted questioning of a police officer nor a traffic infraction constitutes a crime.  No other exigent circumstances are present; therefore, the arrest of defendant was unlawful and violative of his Fourth Amendment rights.  An authorized arrest is an indispensable element of a resisting arrest offense.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former husband alleged conversion by the former wife of personal property belonging exclusively to him. The former wife was awarded possession of the property in the divorce. The third cause of action was based on the judgment of divorce, which directed the parties to execute documents enabling a bank to split their joint bank account between them. The fourth and fifth causes of action were based on the alleged conversion by the former wife of half of the parties' 1977 joint income tax refund. The sixth cause of action was based on a judgment obtained by a department store against the former husband following the divorce. A decision on the posttrial motion regarding the tax refund did not constitute law of the case and neither it, nor the judgment of divorce, barred the interposition of the first three causes of action. Dismissing the third cause of action, the court noted that the action regarding the joint bank account was an action on a judgment, which, under the circumstances, was impermissible. Summary judgment was denied because N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 176 was found unconstitutional. Accordingly, the personal property could have been awarded to the former husband.</SPAN></P>

The right to damages for wrongful death accrued at the moment of the decedent's death.

The court summarily declared that the law applied only to services rendered in connection with their employment as teaching professionals, but the appellate court reversed and remanded for trial. On remand, the court declared that article 8-AA encompassed a doctor's fees from private practice as patient care was an integral part of a doctor's teaching responsibilities, and the law was meant to implement a collective bargaining agreement intended to apply to all patient care services. The court further held that article 8-AA did not violate any constitutional rights because the law was rationally related to the legitimate state and university interests of fostering full-time devotion to teaching duties, and the doctors had no constitutional right to engage in the private practice of medicine while holding a public position of employment as teachers at the university.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the rule regulating the admissibility of a toxicological report, which was found in N.Y.

The rental service was engaged in the business of providing relevant information concerning the availability of rental housing to prospective tenants in exchange for an agreed upon fee. The legislation and accompanying regulations were enacted in response to complaints about referrals to nonexistent or inappropriate apartments and to prevent the use of misleading advertisements. In denying the injunction and upholding the constitutionality of the contested statute and regulations, the court held the regulations were reasonably related and made uniformly applicable to a type of business conduct which the state could constitutionally limit or proscribe. Commercial speech enjoyed a more limited form of constitutional privilege than other types of protected expression and was subject to the strict requirements of truthfulness, and if found to false or misleading, could be totally prohibited.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the request for the &quot;other documents&quot; because there was not a sufficient showing as to need and justification, and the request was too broad. As to the requested letters, the court was convinced of the specificity, special need, and justification for them, and ordered their production. There was little dispute of the possible probative value of these documents to the charges; their inaccessibility through other sources, primarily the hospital itself; and the reasonableness of the request. The court was satisfied that the U.S. Const. amend.

Respondent objected and challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Fam. Ct.

The court agreed with respondent and held that the state constitution prohibited a state from removing a child from parental custody absent a judicial finding of unfitness or neglect.

He moved to set aside the verdict on the grounds that the chain of custody on the substance was not established, that the evidence against him was insufficient to support conviction and that the court's instruction shifting the burden to him to prove that he legally possessed the controlled dangerous substance violated his due process rights. Defendant argued that the proof of two of the elements of the crime charged, ownership of the car in which the controlled substance was found and his knowledge of the substance, were circumstantial in nature and that they fell short of the proof required. The court rejected defendant's arguments and denied the motion because the chain of custody adequately established the identity and unchanged condition of the substance, the jury was properly instructed on its right to make or reject inferences based upon the evidence presented, and defendant failed to raise the issue regarding the burden shifting at trial.</SPAN></P>

The court held that under &sect; 622 and the constitutional guarantees of due process, clear and convincing evidence was required to support a finding of permanent neglect. The court had jurisdiction over the matter notwithstanding the fact that the absent father was not served, because under N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 1001 he would not be adversely affected as his consent to the adoption would not be required under &sect; 111 of the Act.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A guardian cannot be appointed for the purpose of a child's adoption (Social Services Law, &sect; 384-b, subd 4, par [d]) unless a successful permanent neglect proceeding or other proceeding to terminate parental rights has been brought against an unwed father whose consent to the adoption is required (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 111) and a named father should be served if the known facts or gaps in knowledge show even a slight likelihood that he has a right to be heard in a proceeding to transfer a child's guardianship for the purpose of adoption but when it is established with complete clarity that a man is outside the classes of unwed fathers with a right to be heard because of his failure to maintain any contacts with his child, he need not be joined and served as a necessary party merely because the mother has named him; accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to entertain a guardianship proceeding initiated by petitioners foster parents despite their failure to serve the named unwed father.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Although the statute provides that a &quot;fair preponderance of the evidence&quot; suffices for a fact finding of permanent neglect (Family Ct Act, &sect; 622), a parent's constitutional due process rights require the application of the higher &quot;clear and convincing&quot; standard of proof in a permanent neglect proceeding; accordingly, on the basis of such &quot;clear and convincing&quot; evidence, permanent neglect is found in that respondent mother &quot;failed * * * substantially and continuously * * * to maintain contact&quot; with her child for over a year of the child's foster care although financially able to do so (Family Ct Act, &sect; 611; Social Services Law, &sect; 384-b, subd 7, par [a]), the availability of public funds constituting financial capability from the standpoint of permanent neglect inasmuch as the purpose of the financial ability clause is to preclude a permanent neglect finding only when the parent's failure to maintain contact is attributable to external impossibility, and the fact that the respondent reestablished contact with her child after the statutory one-year &quot;critical period&quot; does not preclude a permanent neglect finding nor was the foster&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  care agency, which made good faith efforts to encourage respondent's relationship with her child, under a duty to pressure respondent to visit her child during the &quot;critical period&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Abused or Neglected Child -- Permanent Neglect</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Due process of law does not require that a foster care agency warn a parent of the possibility of a permanent neglect proceeding (Family Ct Act, &sect; 611) prior to the acts of neglect thereafter alleged and, in any event, the requirement of an advance warning cannot be judicially imposed as a condition of the rights of the other parties in the proceeding since it would frustrate the foster care review statutory scheme (Social Services Law, &sect; 392); relegating major considerations of the child's best interests, including a purported desire for adoption by the foster parents, to the second stage of a permanent neglect proceeding so that it becomes the central focus only if the court first finds neglectful conduct by the parent, is a constitutional &quot;attempt to balance the rights of the parents against those of the child&quot;.  </SPAN></P>

Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 384-b. The mother's attorney filed a motion for an order dismissing the petitions on the ground that &sect; 384-b was unconstitutional. The court denied the motion. Many decisions had established the power of the state to deprive a parent of the custody of his or her child where there would be a danger of neglect to the child if the parent were allowed custody. A parent could be deprived of custody for the entire minority of the child. A child who was made a ward of the state could thus be kept in indefinite foster care. If the state could deprive such a parent of custody through annual proceedings, then the state may deprive such a parent who may be free of fault of the custody of his child for all time where the proof was clear and convincing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class members sought attorney's fees on behalf of a nonprofit group that had served as their counsel. The legislators and county officials contended that any grant of attorney's fees was inappropriate and that even if they were in fact proper, the amount requested was excessive. The court held that only a showing of minimum causality between the class members' lawsuit and achievement of the remedy sought was necessary to trigger an award of fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The court found that because the class had in fact substantially prevailed, compensation even for time spent on the unsuccessful issue of punitive damages was within the ambit of &sect; 1988. Further, the court ruled that an award of attorney's fees was not any less appropriate because the class members' attorney was a nonprofit legal organization which did not charge for its services.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court was a motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint brought under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3213 by plaintiff third assignee of a promissory note, based on a cognovit judgment from the state of Pennsylvania. The issue was whether the judgment should have been entered in New York in accordance with the full faith and credit provisions of U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A cognovit judgment was entered by a Pennsylvania court prior to defendant debtor's default. The third assignee of the promissory note then filed a motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint on the cognovit judgment. The debtor contended that if entered in New York, the judgment was almost certain to have become a lien on her principal residence, in contradiction to the agreement of the parties and the warrant of authority to confess judgment. The court denied the motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint and dismissed the proceeding, finding that there were no issues of fact to be resolved and no valid basis for enforcement of the foreign judgment. If the judgment was entered in New York, there may never have been a determination of the dispute on the merits and the effect would have been deprivation of property without due process of law. As the Pennsylvania judgment lacked the degree of finality that it would have been given in New York, the court questioned whether it had the conclusiveness to evoke the full faith and credit requirement. The court also questioned whether Pennsylvania had constitutional jurisdiction to render the judgment initially.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a cognovit clause in a promissory note that gives an unlimited warrant to a third party to confess judgment at any time without prior notice even before an action is commenced is not per se violative of due process, a foreign cognovit judgment that is found to result in a denial of due process because of a significant deprivation of a property interest without an opportunity to be heard is not entitled to full faith and credit in New York and will not be enforced; accordingly, a Pennsylvania cognovit judgment entered by the clerk of a Pennsylvania court prior to defendant's default on a promissory note which contained a cognovit clause excluding the debtor's &quot;principal residence&quot; from the lien of any confessed judgment, is not entitled to enforcement in New York since a significant deprivation of a property interest occurs upon the entry of judgment and, inasmuch as defendant has not yet been given an opportunity to be heard in Pennsylvania where a court may open the judgment if there is sufficient evidence to go to a jury, the entry of the judgment in New York and the resulting lien on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  real property ( CPLR 5018, subd [a]; 5203, subd [a]) would be an unconstitutional violation of defendant's due process rights and, in addition, the Pennsylvania judgment lacks the degree of finality and conclusiveness necessary to entitle it to full faith and credit.  </SPAN></P>

The psychiatrist felt that the mother would not be able to tolerate the stresses of parenthood, with or without medication. Her potential for relapse represented a clearly dangerous situation to which young children should not be exposed. The court found the grandparents well-meaning but not viable resources to assist the mother. While the court had no doubt that the mother was sincere in her desire to do whatever the court required of her, the court found that the dispositional alternative attended by the fewest harmful effects on the children would be to terminate the mother's rights and commence adoption proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Social Services Law and the Family Court Act do not make special provision for a separate dispositional hearing in a proceeding to terminate parental rights based on allegations of mental illness, it is wholly within the sound discretion of the Judge to order such a hearing in appropriate cases; the statutory distinction contained in section 384-b of the Social Services Law between mentally ill or retarded parents and neglectful or abusive parents is rational considering the potential damage to a young child exposed to a mentally ill parent.  Accordingly, a termination of respondent's parental rights is in the best interests of her children where the evidence at the dispositional hearing reveals that she would not be able to tolerate the stresses of parenthood due to schizophrenia. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The natural parents never married, but they maintained a close relationship for several months after the birth of the child. The natural father had been adjudicated the father and had paid support until the mother ended visitation rights when the adoption proceedings were initiated. Although the amended N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 111 did not equalize the rights of all fathers of children born out of wedlock with the rights of the mothers, it did provide two categories of fathers whose consent was required. Section 111 required the court to distinguish between unconcerned fathers and concerned fathers who had accepted responsibility. Since the child was over six months of age, the father fell within &sect; 111(d), and his consent was required for the proposed adoption. Substantial uncontroverted testimony showed that the father held himself out to be the child's father and that he maintained a close and loving relationship with the child. Although the discontinuance of child support was improper, there was no evidence of abandonment of his financial responsibility toward the child. Further, petitioner failed to disprove the fact that respondent was a concerned father.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the consent of the putative father was not required under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 111(1). The court noted that it was impossible to tell when the child in question was placed with her grandparents for the purpose of adoption because the grandparents had raised the child since birth.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney sought original probate (New York) of decedent's last will and testament and requested to be appointed executor and trustee pursuant to N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc. Act &sect; 1605. Decedent died a domiciliary of Florida but she was buried in New York and had approximately half of her assets in New York. The will was drafted and executed in New York while she was a domiciliary, prior to her move to Florida.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney could not be appointed in Florida as the personal representative of the decedent's estate because Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 733.304 prohibited a nonresident from qualifying as a personal representative, executor, or administrator unless that person was related to the decedent. The attorney did not qualify under &sect; 733.304 and so he could not qualify in Florida under its statutes. The court found that whether or not the Florida statute was constitutional, an issue that was up for debate, original probate could be granted under N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc. Act &sect; 1605. Section 1605(2)(c) permitted original probate where the laws of a testator's domicile discriminated against domiciliaries of New York either as a beneficiary or a fiduciary. The court concluded that because the Florida law discriminated against nonresidents such as the attorney, the proceeding came within the purview of &sect; 1605. Additionally, the court noted that no probate proceeding had been commenced in Florida. Consequently, the will could be originally probated in New York even if Florida did not discriminate, pursuant to &sect; 1605(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator was indicted on numerous counts of larceny based on charges that he, inter alia, commingled personal allowance funds, and committed thefts of certain Supplemental Security Income checks and Social Security checks from former residents. The operator filed a motion to inspect the grand jury minutes and a motion to dismiss the indictment, or alternatively, for certain specified items of discovery and a bill of particulars. The court denied the motions. The court held that the operator had no good faith claim of right to retain and possess the checks in question, and the operator did not have lawful possession of them. The proof at the grand jury appeared legally sufficient to support each and every count charged, and the operator's motion to dismiss for lack of evidence was denied on that ground. The court also found that the prosecutor did not fail to provide the grand jury with proper legal instructions, and the operator failed to demonstrate that the prosecutor knowingly withheld any evidence which could lend support to the operator's claim of right argument.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a sufficient defense to a larceny charge that the property was appropriated openly and avowedly under a claim of title proffered in good faith, even though such claim is untenable; however, the theory of claim of right, now contained in subdivision 1 of section 155.15 of the Penal Law, does not excuse the retention of the property of another to offset or pay demand held against him.  Accordingly, the contention of defendant, the operator of a home for adults who was charged with the theft of certain Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security checks from former residents of the home, that he is entitled to the checks in question under a claim of right arising from his &quot;substantial reliance&quot; upon information contained in a civil audit showing outstanding moneys allegedly owing to him by New York State and, alternatively, that under an unsubstantiated &quot;30-day rule&quot; the owner of an adult home may keep open a bed upon discharge of a resident for 30 days beyond the actual discharge date, which rule affords him a lawful claim to take those SSI and Social Security checks which were issued for the month covered by this alleged&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;grace period&quot;, is without merit; clearly, lacking any basis in law giving him a good faith claim of right to retain and possess the checks in question, defendant here did not have lawful possession of them and, in the absence of such a claim of right, any claimed &quot;offset&quot; is irrelevant.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being voluntarily placed in foster care, the child was placed in the custody of the foster parents, who continuously cared for the child since he was three months old. At the time the related petitions were filed by the DSS and the foster parents, the natural father was incarcerated in another state for an aggravated robbery conviction. The court granted the DSS's petition and subsequently granted the foster parents' petition for direct adoption. The court held that N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 111(2)(d) dispensed with the natural father's parental consent to the adoption because the natural father had been deprived of his civil rights by virtue of his assault conviction. The court further held that the application of &sect; 111(2)(d) did not violate substantive due process or equal protection because the state had a compelling interest in achieving permanency in the parent-child relationship for children whose natural parents were unable or unwilling to provide continuous, stable, and long-term care and because the adoption without the natural father's consent was substantially related to the legitimate state interest in achieving such permanency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An out-of-State felony conviction and sentence results in a loss of civil rights (Civil Rights Law, &sect; 79) for purposes of a statute which dispenses with parental consent to an adoption for a parent &quot;who has been deprived of civil rights pursuant to the civil rights law and whose civil rights have not been restored&quot; (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 111, subd 2, par [d]) since dispensing with parental consent in an adoption proceeding on the basis of a non-New York State conviction which would be a felony in New York furthers the legitimate State objective of achieving permanency for children by removing legal barriers to their adoption; in addition, the statute eliminating the need for parental consent because of incarceration is not unconstitutionally overbroad on its face since termination of parental consent requirements for adoption because of a criminal conviction and sentence has no &quot;chilling effect&quot; on the exercise of parental rights and, in any event, constitutional issues concerning parental rights must be determined on the basis of the application of the statute to the actual facts of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  each case rather than on the basis of facial validity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. When there has been a separation of parent from child at early infancy, followed by an extended prison sentence of the father and an integration of the child into the family unit of foster parents, the State can validly terminate the father's parental rights and grant an adoption to the foster parents based solely on the child's best interests without a specific finding of unfitness; accordingly, in light of respondent's 1979 Texas robbery conviction and 5- to 15-year prison sentence, the absence of any functional relationship between respondent and his child, the substantial future period before respondent could begin to create such relationship and the close familial ties between the child and the foster-adoptive parents, dispensing with respondent's consent to the adoption because of his incarceration (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 111, subd 2, par [d]) does not violate due process or equal protection inasmuch as granting the adoption is in the child's best interests and bears a substantial relation to the legitimate State interest&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of achieving permanency for children whose parents are unable or unwilling to provide stable long-term continuous care and superimposing a constitutional requirement of a preliminary finding of parental unfitness would not accomplish any greater protection of respondent's rights without sacrificing or unduly postponing achievement of the goal of permanency. </SPAN></P>

However, the school board could not terminate her services for a constitutionally impermissible purpose.

If petitioner was in fact dismissed solely due to her attempt to adhere to statutory mandates and her own professional standards as a psychologist, her dismissal would be arbitrary, capricious and unconstitutional, and accordingly, the matter is remanded to the Commissioner of Education to resolve the issues of alleged neglect of statutory duties regarding handicapped children in the district and whether said neglect resulted in the termination of petitioner's services for a constitutionally impermissible purpose.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant was an employee of a textile manufacturer and was responsible for setting prices for goods sold. Defendant sold goods below the retail value to third parties that in turn re-sold the goods sharing a portion of the profits with defendant personally. Defendant moved to dismiss the larceny charges contending that conduct, which constituted commercial bribe receiving, could not also constitute larceny. The court denied the motion, saying that the same conduct may constitute more than one crime and that they may all be charged in the same indictment. The court defined the elements of larceny by embezzlement, which required a conversion of property belonging to another, which had been entrusted to the embezzler. Although defendant was authorized to sell the goods, he was not authorized to sell the goods below their market value and receive kickbacks for his own account. Selling the goods on the terms he did was an unauthorized assumption of rights of ownership over goods belonging to another, which constituted conversion.</SPAN></P>

The United States government took an assignment after paying off the bank. Four days after such assignment, a county tax lien arose. The county tax lien was sold to the claimant. Before delivery of the tax deed, however, the United State's foreclosed on the property. The condemnor received a deed through the foreclosure sale. No notice of the foreclosure was given to the claimant, although the United State's was aware of the tax sale. In denying claimant's motion to compel the condemnor to make an offer of payment, the court held that the condemnor's title was superior. In so ruling, the court stated that the United State's lien, which arose upon assignment, was first in time to the county's tax lien. As such, the condemnor, whose title derived from the United States, prevailed. The court rejected the claimant's contention that his lien was superior because the condemnor did not exercise its right of redemption under N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 1020(1). In so ruling, the court held that, under the Supremacy Clause of the United State's Constitution, the state was not permitted to impair the United State's lien.</SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding to annul a determination of respondent Adirondack Park Agency (New York), which disapproved the property owner's application for approval of a three-lot subdivision and a shoreline variance, and for an order directing the Agency to approve the plan as submitted by the landowner and to grant the variance requested. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner sought subdivision approval and a shoreline setback variance for a six-acre lot he owned on the Hudson River. When permission was denied, he brought an action against the Agency. He alleged that there was an unconstitutional delegation of police power when the legislature delegated to the Agency the authority to promulgate setback requirements. The court held that because N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 15-2701 et seq. contained sufficiently clear standards and guidelines within which the Agency could properly exercise its discretion, the delegation was proper. The setback restrictions were not unconstitutional, illegal, or invalid although they were not promulgated for the purposes of public health, safety, and morals; aesthetic principles were an acceptable basis for land use restrictions. The regulation was entitled to a strong presumption of constitutionality, and the property owner did not meet his burden of establishing that the setback restriction was irrational and unconstitutional. The Agency's action did not effect an unconstitutional taking of private property; the owner was not deprived of the reasonable use or of a reasonable return on his property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the property owner's motion for summary judgment and granted the Agency's summary judgment motion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner cigarette wholesaler commenced suit against respondent Commissioner of the Department of Finance of New York City (finance commissioner) and sought judgment declaring New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect;&sect; D46-15.0 and D46-17.0 unconstitutional, annulling certain warrants, restraining notices of sale, and annulling a notice of postseizure hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The finance commissioner seized 2,300 cartons of cigarettes, three tax meters, and all the tax stamps in possession of a cigarette wholesaler on the basis that the cigarette wholesaler forged the tax meter imprints on the cartons. The cigarette wholesaler commenced suit, and sought judgment declaring New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect;&sect; D46-15.0 and D46-17.0 unconstitutional, annulling certain warrants, restraining notice and notices of sale, and annulling a notice of postseizure hearing. The court granted the motion and held that the cigarette wholesaler was entitled to a hearing. The court held: (1) the seizure, and proposed sale of the unstamped cigarettes was an invalid act by the finance commissioner because the cigarette wholesaler was entitled to a hearing before the cigarettes were sold; (2) the seizure of the items prior to a hearing was not required, however, the imposition of the payment of the tax prior to a hearing was tantamount to the preclusion of the right to due process; and (3) the statutory scheme was not required to be invalidated because the court had the power to disregard provisions of the statute that was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the cigarette wholesaler's petition and issued a judgment that portions of a state statute were unconstitutional, but refused to strike the whole statutory scheme, and held that the cigarette wholesaler was entitled to a hearing on the merits of the seizure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Since the appointment of petitioner, a licensed cigarette wholesaler, as an agent to affix tax stamps to cigarette packages does not amount to a franchise or license, both of which cannot be suspended or revoked without a hearing, petitioner's status is no more than an agent whose agency is terminable at will and, therefore, the suspension of petitioner's agency by respondent New York City Department of Finance without a hearing because of alleged forgeries is valid; however, the seizure, and proposed sale of unstamped cigarettes in petitioner's possession (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; D46-17.0) is invalid as a violation of due process even though petitioner has been offered a postseizure hearing since there is no statute nor any departmental rule requiring a postseizure hearing except at the whim of respondent; the seizure of the tax meters used by petitioner is likewise invalid since no arrest has been made nor any judicial warrant issued and the fact that the meters may have been evidence of the alleged crime of forgery does not give respondent any right to seize them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent New York City Department of Finance, based upon a determination that petitioner, a licensed cigarette wholesaler and appointed tax agent to affix tax stamps to cigarette packages, owed taxes, acted lawfully in issuing an immediate tax warrant, filing it as a judgment and then seizing all of petitioner's assets by way of a levy prior to a hearing; however, since due process requires that a prompt postseizure hearing subject to judicial review be made available and that access to judicial review not be unduly burdened, the statutory provision requiring the full payment of the tax as a precondition to the allowance of judicial review of the propriety of the determination after hearing (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; D46-11.0), effectively deprives petitioner of the opportunity to obtain any judicial review and is thereby violative of due process; granting petitioner access to the courts for a review of the tax determination without the imposition of the improper burden satisfies the demands of due process without having to invalidate the entire statutory scheme.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured sustained fire losses at his premises. She sought to recover on his insurance policy, which contained a standard provision that prohibited an action unless it was commenced within two years of the loss's inception. The insurer filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the claim was time-barred under the contract. The adjuster sought dismissal for failure to state a claim, and for untimeliness. The court granted the insurer's motion and the adjuster's cross-motion to dismiss, concluding that N.Y. C.P.L.R. 214(4) was inapplicable to the insurance policy because that limitation period applied to actions for property damage, not one for breach of an insurance contract. Thus, the two-year limitation period of the policy governed the insured's action because it did not violate public policy or constitutional law. Allegations of estoppel were rejected for lack of evidence, and for failure to raise the issue in the complaint. Finally, the negligent appraisal claim against the adjuster failed because it was untimely, and the adjuster owed no duty to the insured.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An insured's action against an insurance company to recover for a fire loss under the terms of a fire insurance policy is governed by the policy's two-year limitation period which prohibits any action for the recovery of a claim upon the policy unless commenced within two years after inception of the loss (Insurance Law, &sect; 168, subd 5); the shorter limitation period is not prohibited by public policy and is not constitutionally infirm; plaintiff insured's allegations that defendant insurer should be estopped from asserting the limitation period are insufficient to defeat defendant's dismissal motion since estoppel was not pleaded in the complaint and the affidavit of plaintiff's attorney containing conclusory allegations does not supply the requisite evidentiary showing; the agent of the insurer who allegedly negligently conducted an appraisal of plaintiff's loss has the benefit of the short limitation period specified in the insurance agreement and, thus, the action is dismissed as to him also.  </SPAN></P>

Law &sect; 99-c allowed school districts to receive health insurance reserve funds, but if the school district cancelled its health insurance with the State and defaulted in its obligation to repay the health insurance funds, its State assistance was to be reduced. 1977 N.Y. Laws 71, &sect; 8(b) directed the commissioner of education to reduce a school district's budget by an amount of health insurance reserves unreimbursed if the school district filed a notice of intent to leave the State employee health plan. The school district in the instant case received health insurance reserve funds and later withdrew from the State health plan. The district's State aid was reduced by the amount of the health insurance reserves, and the comptroller also wanted to reduce a subsequent year's State aid. The court held that 1977 N.Y. Laws 71, &sect; 8(b) prevailed over inconsistent provisions of N.Y. State Fin.

After the state legislature declared an abnormal disruption for the 1979-1980 heating season, the attorney general brought the action against the corporation. The corporation denied the allegations of the petition and challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 396-r. The corporation asserted &sect; 396-r was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, was pre-empted by Federal statutes and thus in violation of the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution, and otherwise in violation of the due process clauses in the State and Federal Constitutions. On the corporation's motion to dismiss, the court held &sect; 396-r was a price control statute and was therefore unconstitutional in that it conflicted with the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 751 et seq. and its implementing directives and regulations which exempted home heating oil from price regulation, an area in which Congress intended to occupy the entire field.</SPAN></P>

Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 76. The churches sought a further judgment requiring the applicable domestic utility rate to be charged to churches operating adjunctive religious schools.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each of the churches was duly organized and existing under state law and each conducted a school on church premises. The utility, which furnished gas and electric services, notified the churches that the operation of their schools was for other than religious purposes, because secular subjects were being taught as well as religious subjects. The churches appealed to the commission seeking a determination that the utility's practice was improper and not in accordance with &sect; 76. At issue was whether the existence of a church-operated school, teaching secular and religious subjects, within the physical confines of the premises utilized as the church, was an operation so as to remove that church from the statutory mandate of &sect; 76. The court granted the churches' petition on both accounts and held that: (1) because the interpretation of &sect; 76 was one of pure statutory reading and analysis the court was not bound by the commission's interpretation; and (2) to apply the commission's interpretation would be to subvert the &sect; 76 expressed public policy recognizing that the churches should have received the benefit of a lower gas and electric rate in order to foster their general well-being.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The university requested that the trial court dismiss the student's defamation actions on the ground that they were barred by the statute of limitations. The student's first cause of action arose on or about April 24, but he did not file his notice of intention until December 21. The court noted that a claim that arose out of a tortious act had to have been filed within 90 days of the act, unless notice of intention to file such claim was filed within that time period. The court dismissed the first cause of action because the student exceeded the 90-day period and the action could not be maintained. The court found that the student timely filed his second notice of intention. However, the school claimed that the student's action was not commenced within one year of the occurrence and was, therefore, time-barred. The court noted that N.Y. C.P.L.R. 215 required that libel and slander actions had to be commenced within one-year of the occurrence. The court dismissed the student's second cause of action because it was commenced beyond the one-year limitations period, and held that the student's notice of intention was not a claim because it failed to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

Ordinance ch. 70, &sect; 16(17)(e) was unconstitutional in that it required the theater owner to obtain an &quot;adult&quot; permit under his own name and to provide any information required by the director, in order to operate his movie theater. Because &sect; 16(17)(e) subjected the exercise of the First Amendment freedom of speech to the prior restraint of a use permit without narrow, objective, and definite standards by which the director was to exercise his power, it was thus unconstitutional and was not a proper exercise of the police power. The other ordinance provisions were found to be legitimate enactments under the city's police power.</SPAN></P>

The teenager and the child's father were subsequently married and initiated an action to set aside the consent to adopt form and the adoption proceeding. The child's father contended that his consent to the adoption was required under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 111. The court granted the petition to set aside the consent to adopt form, dismissed the adoption proceeding, and referred the matter to the family court. The court found that the child's father did not intend to abandon the child or to rid himself of parental obligations and parental rights. The court held that the child's father attempted to visit the child in the hospital, to be designated on the birth certificate, and to stop the adoption proceedings.

Defendants contended that the local law was unconstitutional. Upon appeal, the court agreed and held that defendants sustained their burden of demonstrating that Town of Gardiner, N.Y., Local Law &sect; 20, No. 3 (1972), was an unconstitutional consent requirement. The court converted the action into one for a declaratory judgment and held that the local law which defendants violated was void and not enforceable.

Conducting civil Family Court child abuse proceedings concurrent with or prior to a criminal prosecution concerning the same underlying acts as provided by statute (Family Ct Act, &sect; 1013, subd [b]; &sect; 1014, subd [c]) is constitutional and does not impose an unconstitutional penalty upon a respondent's constitutional privilege against self incrimination since the choice imposed on a respondent by a forthwith child abuse trial between the right to testify therein and the right against self incrimination is constitutionally permissible in that the choice against testifying in the child abuse trial and risking self incrimination will not result in a direct and automatic loss of a benefit; burdening a respondent with the difficult choice between the right to testify and the right to silence is justified by profound considerations of public policy since delaying a child abuse trial for the period required to resolve the criminal case would leave the child's care in a suspended state for many months and prevent for an incalculable time the long-term planning essential for the child's welfare; in any event, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Family Court's authority to grant a respondent &quot;testimonial immunity in any subsequent criminal court proceeding&quot; (Family Ct Act, &sect; 1014, subd [d]) provides all the protection of the privilege against self incrimination to which a respondent is constitutionally entitled.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A town ordinance, which provides that parking in spaces designated for handicapped persons is by permit only, and which may be enforced in private parking areas upon written request of the owner, may not be enforced against a driver who parked his vehicle in a private parking area in a space designated for handicapped parking since the signs indicating the restricted nature of the space do not conform to State standards and the written request of the owner to enforce handicapped parking constitutes an implicit consent to abide by State law as well as the town ordinance which the signs failed to do; furthermore, the nonconformity of the signs to those used by governmental authorities causes a failure to apprise citizens of the enforceability of the signs by fine or penalty, constituting a trap for the unwary; therefore, the proceeding against the driver must be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved the court for an order dismissing the information charging her with a violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.37(2) on the grounds that the information was insufficient to constitute a violation of &sect; 240.37(2) and that &sect; 240.37(2) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that her prosecution for a violation of &sect; 240.37(2) was unconstitutional because the overwhelming majority of those prosecuted for prostitution were women rather than men. The court found that, although the circumstances of defendant's arrest and the fact that almost all the people arrested in the city for prostitution-related offenses were women would seem to suggest that defendant and other women were victims of bias, a comprehensive view of the prosecutions on prostitution charges showed that there were good and sufficient reasons, mainly problems with manpower, to justify the police on concentrating on the arrest of female prostitutes. The court held that the information was sufficient because all the areas described were public places and the conduct otherwise fell within that which was proscribed under the applicable and statutory case law. The court found that the conduct proscribed was sufficiently delineated to put the public on notice, and thus the law was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Finally, the court ruled that there was a valid public interest and purpose in prohibiting sex for money as opposed to sex that was offered freely.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the fact that almost all the persons arrested in Buffalo for prostitution-related offenses are women is based on good and sufficient reasons, mainly problems with police manpower justifying the police in concentrating on the arrest of female prostitutes rather than their male customers, defendant has failed in her burden of proving that her prosecution for loitering for the purpose of engaging in a prostitution offense (Penal Law, &sect; 240.37, subd 2) violates her rights as a woman under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; the conduct proscribed by the statute is sufficiently delineated to put the public on notice and thus the law is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad and there is also a valid public interest and purpose in prohibiting sex for money as opposed to sex which is offered freely. </SPAN></P>

The decedent's children also sought leave to file a jury demand nunc pro tunc. Although the court denied summary judgment to each of the parties on most of the claims because triable issues of fact existed, it concluded that the validity of payments made to the executors was an issue of law that depended entirely on the constitutionality of N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc. Act Law &sect; 2307. The court determined that the statute, which directed a uniform rate of compensation for executors, was constitutional because it treated those similarly situated equally; thus, objections to the payments were dismissed. The court denied the request by the decedent's children for leave to file a jury demand nunc pro tunc because the proceeding was essentially equitable in nature and historically and traditionally no jury trial was available under any statute or constitution.</SPAN></P>

Under the lease, the house was to be demolished and the lessee was going to construct an office building (office). A statute was passed to save the house, authorizing the superintendent of buildings to refuse to issue a demolition permit. The statute was declared unconstitutional, but the lessee was deprived of it's intended use of the premises for eight months. The appellate court determined that the lessee was entitled to the fair rental value of the property, as determined by what a willing lessee would pay and a willing lessor would accept for the use of the premises for the eight months of the taking. The court computed the fair rental value by estimating the operating expenses and the projected income using both the state's and the lessee's methods. The court used future projections of income in determining the fair rental value because the property was intended to be developed. Because damages were incurred continuously during the course of the taking period, interest was computed from the midpoint of the taking period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Termination of the mother's parental rights was ordered because of mental illness, and the court of appeals reversed, referring the case for a new trial. The mother filed a motion for dismissal challenging the constitutionality of N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 384-b, which permitted termination on grounds of mental illness or mental retardation. The court denied the motion for dismissal and held that &sect; 384-b was constitutional. The court found that the classifications did not violate equal protection, that there was no presumption that the parent was unfit, and that the statute required a higher standard of proof of clear and convincing evidence that the parent was mentally ill. The court found further that the statute required a showing that termination was in the best interest of the child and that the fundamental rights of the parent ware clearly balanced against the child's fundamental rights.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the preamble was clear and concise, providing that &sect; 236(A) was applicable to actions previously filed. The legislative intent was to create a new system for maintenance and distribution of assets only with respect to those actions commenced after the effective date of the statute. The only exception was for agreements the parties made between themselves so as to relieve them of the strict interpretation of the legislation.

The company sought a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction. The company objected to a certain commissioner's participation in the rate case proceedings. The commission contended the company's sole remedy was found in N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 and that the declaratory judgment action was so inappropriate as to warrant a dismissal. The commission also argued the action before the court was premature as it was brought before the determination of administrative proceedings in violation of the finality requirement of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7801. The court determined that the commission was entitled to judgment dismissing the complaint for the reason that the complaint failed to state a cause of action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were granted adjournments in contemplation of dismissal (ACD) upon their promises to make restitution. Upon failure of restitution, plaintiff had the matters restored. Defendants' dereliction was due to indigency occasioned by the loss of their jobs subsequent to the restitution agreement. Defendants brought a motion to dismiss the renewal of criminal prosecutions against them, arguing that the renewal of criminal prosecution by the restoration of an ACD because of the failure of restitution due to indigency in the six-month period between disposition and final dismissal was not permissible. The court ruled that restitution became inappropriate when defendants' financial condition was such that a civil judgment against them would be incapable of satisfaction by virtue of indigency. Further, the court held that indigency precluded revocation of probation for inability to pay a fine, it precluded incarceration for inability to pay court costs, and there was no distinction between the deprivation worked upon defendants when inability to make restitution payments triggered renewed prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restoration of an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal to the Trial Calendar ( CPL 170.55, subd 2) on the basis of defendant's failure to make restitution to the victim, due to defendant's indigency, is improper and impermissible since restoration on these grounds will have an unconstitutional effect; once the prosecutor has determined that a matter merits dismissal, defendant's inability, due to indigency, to complete restitution payments is an illegitimate basis for reversing the decision since to mandate restoration of a case on this basis is to create a class of status offenders, namely the impoverished; there should be no distinction made between the deprivation worked upon a defendant when inability to make restitution payments triggers renewed prosecution and when inability to pay a fine causes revocation of probation, which is precluded by the indigent status of the defendant.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were issued summonses alleging that they operated an unlicensed cabaret in violation of the city administrative code. The people alleged that the establishment in question featured a five-piece band and that the patrons engaged in dancing on the premises where drinks were sold. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss all of the summonses on the grounds that they were unconstitutional as violative of U.S. Const. amend. I, XIV. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional because it clearly banned dancing. The court noted that the ostensible purpose of the licensing ordinance was to give the Department of Consumer Affairs the power to regulate certain kinds of establishments where the health and safety of the people may need to be protected. The court further noted that the portion of the statute that allowed music by mechanical devices, while live music was subject to licensing was outdated. The court reasoned that because of technology advances, mechanical devices could now sound like an orchestra and that the distinction between live and mechanical music had become obsolete.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A portion of the Administrative Code of the City of New York (Administrative Code, &sect;&sect; B32-297.0, B32-296.0, subd 3), which prohibits the operation of an unlicensed cabaret, is capable of a broad interpretation which the legislature may not have intended and the citizen who runs an establishment providing amusement not specifically prohibited by the statute is left at his peril, not knowing if he has violated a penal statute and, likewise, that portion of the statute which creates an exception to the licensing requirement could conceivably mandate a result not intended by the legislature in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  view of modern technology; accordingly, inasmuch as judicial self-restraint and due deference for the separation of powers doctrine dictate that a trial court's determination of invalidity be made only when such construction is inelectably inescapable, the ordinance need not be declared unconstitutional as applied to defendants where it is alleged that the establishment in question featured a five-piece band with brass and percussion instruments and that the patrons engaged in dancing on the premises where drinks were sold since the part of the statute that requires an establishment with dancing to obtain a cabaret license is clearly acceptable as the kind of activity that can be regulated.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner candidates filed an action against respondent board of election seeking to require that the candidates for two vacancies for the public office of judge of a civil court from a certain district to run together in a primary election for a certain political party, with the two receiving the greatest number of votes to become the nominees of such party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When one of two civil judges assigned to a district retired, creating a vacancy for which a nomination had to be made at a primary election, the board of elections made available a list of all vacancies in the office of civil court judge, and designating petitions for such vacancy were circulated and filed for four candidates. Then, the remaining judge was removed, creating a vacancy seven days before the last day to circulate designating petitions and requiring a nomination at the primary election. Two candidates for the first vacancy sought to require the candidates for both vacancies to run together, with the two receiving the greatest number of votes being the nominees of the party. The court held that: (1) where the vacancy had not occurred within such time as to permit the designation of the vacancy upon the list required by N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 6-168(1), &sect; 6-168(3), giving a nomination without participation in a primary election, was not effective; and (2) instead, &sect; 6-168(4) applied, requiring that candidates for both vacancies be listed on the primary ballot without reference to the seat designated, and the two highest number of votes would be nominees for such office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the candidates' petition to the extent that the board of elections should arrange the ballot for the political party's primary election in such a manner as to reflect two vacancies for the public office, to place upon said ballot the names of all persons whose petitions had been validated for either vacancy, and to declare as the nominees those two candidates receiving the highest number of votes in said primary election.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the teacher presented no evidence that the discontinuance or termination reviews, which were held pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, were wrongful, illegal, or improper. Respondents acted completely within their discretionary authority when they discontinued the teacher's probationary employment. The decision to reinstate the teacher was also within respondents' discretionary authority and was not an admission of wrongdoing or an adjudication on the merits of the teacher's earlier discontinuance.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A probationary teacher, reinstated by the Chancellor after termination, is not entitled to back salary for the duration of her termination, since, pursuant to section 2573 of the Education Law, the school board may dismiss the probationary teacher at any time; she therefore has no property rights attaching to her employment; the board's discontinuance of the teacher's probationary employment and its subsequent reinstatement of the teacher were completely within its discretionary authority, and not an admission of wrongdoing or an adjudication on the merits of her discontinuance; accordingly, the teacher has no basis for her claim of back pay upon reinstatement, and since neither the Constitution nor New York law recognizes the right of a reinstated probationer to an award of back pay, such a payment would be an unconstitutional gift of funds.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency instituted a proceeding under N.Y. Soc. Serv. Laws &sect; 384-b to terminate the father's parental rights. The father was served by publication, a default inquest was held, and an order of termination was entered. By order to show cause, the father sought to set aside the order and have a hearing on the ground that he had received no notice of the proceeding. The father alleged that when the agency brought the action, he was in a state correctional institution and no research or diligent effort was made to contact him there to give him notice of the proceeding before jurisdiction was obtained by publication. He also said that he was on parole and had learned of the proceedings for the first time. The agency argued against reopening the hearing because the father's confinement at a state correctional facility for a felony conviction meant that his consent to an adoption was not required under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Laws &sect; 111(2)(d). The court reopened the case. The court held that section 111(2)(d) as applied to parolees was unconstitutional because the lack of distinction between parents who were on parole and parents who were incarcerated made no rational sense.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The default of a respondent father in a proceeding to terminate his parental rights on the ground of abandonment pursuant to section 384-b of the Social Services Law must be vacated and a hearing must be held to determine whether there are grounds for termination on the merits; the father, who was incarcerated in a State correctional institution at the time that the default occurred, was served by publication, and no inquiry was made to the New York State Department of Correctional Services, under whose jurisdiction he was held; therefore, his default must be vacated in the interests of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Termination of Parental Rights -- Dismissal of Proceeding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The petition of a child welfare agency brought to terminate the father's parental rights on the ground of abandonment may not be dismissed since a dismissal would implicity determine that section 111 (subd 2, par [d]) of the Domestic Relations Law, pursuant to which the agency claims that the father, by operation of his incarceration in a State correctional institution and subsequent parole, is not entitled to a hearing on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the merits of his fitness as a parent, is valid and, therefore, acts as a bar to a further proceeding; furthermore, dismissal is improper since it would prejudice the rights of the child who would necessarily remain in limbo while a new proceeding is begun; therefore, the validity of section 111 (subd 2, par [d]), as limited to the father's situation, must be determined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Consent of Parolee Father</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. As applied to parolees, section 111 (subd 2, par [d]) of the Domestic Relations Law, which provides that the consent of a parent sentenced to a term of imprisonment is not required for the adoption of his child is unconstitutional since the lack of distinction between prisoners, who are being punished for their crimes, and parolees, who are considered worthy of rehabilitation, has no rational basis; the punishment aspect of dispensing with a parolee's consent to the adoption of his child makes successful rehabilitation more difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The strict scrutiny test must be applied in determining whether section 111 (subd 2, par [d]) of the Domestic Relations Law, which provides that the consent of a parent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sentenced to a term of imprisonment is unnecessary for the adoption of the child, is violative of the equal protection clause, since the fundamental right of a parent to rear his child is involved; no compelling State interest exists to apply section 111 (subd 2, par [d]) to parolees since the parent is no longer incarcerated, may be beginning to rehabilitate himself and can play an active role in the rearing of his child; denying the father this right does not serve the compelling State interest of providing the child with a stable and permanent home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Due Process of Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A parolee father, whose parental rights are sought to be terminated without his consent on the basis of section 111 (subd 2, par [d]) of the Domestic Relations Law, is denied procedural due process since the presumption of unfitness, used solely, in this instance, because it is more convenient to presume than to prove, is insufficient to justify denying the father a hearing when the issue is the dismemberment of his family.  Since both the interests of the parent and the child must be balanced, as in New York the best interests of the child standard may only be applied in extraordinary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  circumstances, the parolee father is entitled to a hearing to ascertain whether or not extraordinary circumstances are present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Due Process of Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A parolee father is denied procedural due process of law by operation of section 111 (subd 2, par [d]) of the Domestic Relations Law, which provides that the consent of a parent sentenced to a term of imprisonment is not required for the adoption of the child, since parole status is distinguishable from incarceration and application of the statute to a parolee father would deprive him of his parental rights simply because of his status as a felon parolee without reference to his fitness as a parent; accordingly, a hearing on the ground of abandonment, the ground on which the petition was originally instituted, is mandated.  </SPAN></P>

Local Law No. 3, 1980 of the Town of North Greenbush which made the &quot;veterans' exemption&quot; of section 458 of the Real Property Tax Law subject to increase or decrease in the same proportion as the assessed valuation of &quot;any real property&quot; in the Town of North Greenbush is increased or decreased on the assessment roll to be finally completed and filed in 1980 by reason of real property being assessed at full value on such assessment roll, and was passed by the town board without a vote by the taxpayers, is not subject to the permissive referendum requirement of section 24 (subd 2, par c) of the Municipal Home Rule Law, since that requirement gives property owners the right to vote on local laws relating to the procedure or manner of assessment, but not on local laws which implement an exemption from taxes which is legally permissible under the Real Property Tax Law; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  said local law does not change a provision of law relating to assessments of real property because it does not change the procedure or manner of assessment as does a change from &quot;fractional&quot; to &quot;full value&quot; assessments.</SPAN></P>

A statute is presumed constitutional unless the discrimination between different classes of citizens has no relevance to the purpose for which the classification is made; here, the tax benefit given veterans, presumably because they have offered some portion of their lives in service to the country, which is not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  accorded non-veterans, is not violative of equal protection. </SPAN></P>
