The court held that the city complied with the notice and hearing requirements for the annexation proceeding, and that the protests received by the city council did not deprive the city of jurisdiction to annex the territory. The court held that the annexation was not unreasonable, and the permissible shape, character, and extent of the territory annexed was a political question. The court held that the annexation was not a fraudulent abuse of the authority conferred by Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 35300-35326, and did not operate to take property without due process of law. The court stated that the prospect that the city would extend its ordinary municipal services such as police and fire protection to the annexed territory would justify the imposition of ad valorem taxes.</SPAN></P>

Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 170.6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The superior court asserted that &sect; 170.6 made an unconstitutional delegation of legislative and judicial powers to litigants and was an unwarranted interference with the powers of the court because it failed to require the litigant to set forth the reasons that constituted the basis for the assertion that the judge was prejudiced and because there was no provision for a judicial determination of whether the judge was prejudiced. Deferring to the legislature, the court determined that the legislature could have reasonably concluded that a party should have an opportunity to obtain the disqualification upon a sworn statement. The possible abuse inherent in the procedure of &sect; 170.6 was a matter to be balanced against the attainment of the statute's objective. The court rejected the argument that the filing of an affidavit without a hearing was unconstitutional as depriving the court of judicial power because the legislature required a showing in the form of a statement under oath.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ordered a writ of mandate to issue directing the superior court to assign the case for trial to a different judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff pension claimants (claimants) brought an action against defendants, a city and its pension board (collectively city), seeking to enforce pension payments upon a fluctuating basis rather than in fixed amounts. The claimants sought both declaratory and money judgments. The Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) ruled in favor of the city. The claimants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Claimants were employees and widows of employees of the city. While the employees were employed, but prior to retirement, the city amended its charter to grant pensions on a fixed, rather than a fluctuating, basis. The claimants alleged that amendments were invalid as applied to them. The court noted that the claimants' rights to the fluctuating pensions had vested during their employment and could only be modified prior to retirement for the purpose of maintaining the integrity of the pension system. The court found that no new advantage had been granted to the claimants that would be substantially commensurate with the disadvantages of the amendments. Further, there was no showing that the amendments bore any material relation to the integrity or preservation of the pension program applicable to the claimants. The city's allegation of rising costs alone did not excuse the city from meeting its contractual obligations. However, pursuant to the city charter, the amount of damages was limited to those payments that had accrued within six months prior to the time the claimants presented claims therefor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) found the defendant guilty of robbery, rape, sex perversion, kidnapping, kidnapping for the purpose of robbery, and sentenced him to death. A motion for a new trial was denied. The judgments of death were appealed automatically pursuant to Cal. Pen. Code &sect; 1239(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant objected to jurors' examination on their opinions on capital punishment and to the discussion of their responsibility for imposing the death penalty if warranted by the facts of the case. On appeal, the court found that a prosecutor in a death penalty case has the right to ascertain the views of the potential jurors. He also asserted that it was prejudicial error for the prosecutor to have stated both in his voir dire examination of the jury and his closing argument that a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole would not necessarily mean that he would remain in prison for the remainder of his life. On appeal, the court found that the remarks could only have been taken by the jurors as factors to be considered in assessing the penalty. The defendant also argued that Cal. Pen. Code &sect; 209, which permitted the imposition of the death penalty for the crime of kidnapping to commit robbery if the victim suffers bodily harm, applied only where the movement was over a substantial distance and not merely between the rooms in a dwelling. However, the court held that it was the fact, not the distance, of forcible removal that constituted kidnapping.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied defendant's motion to augment the record and affirmed the judgments of death and the order denying a new trial.</SPAN></P>

He requested that defendant city change the zoning from residential to a commercial zone, which was done by adopting a city ordinance. A majority of the voters had voted against the ordinance at a subsequent referendum. The issue before the court was whether the zoning ordinance was subject to referendum. The amendment of legislation was necessarily legislative in character. Where the city amended a zoning ordinance so as to exclude from a particular zone property previously included in such zone, its act in amending was a legislative act and not an administrative act.  Cal. Gov. Code &sect; 65804 made no distinction between adopting zoning ordinances and making amendments thereto. As it was acting in a legislative capacity, the ordinance was subject to referendum. Since no hearing before the legislative body was held, the ordinance was not validly enacted. If plaintiffs' position were adopted, it would give to a validating act a prospective operation, and would prevent it from having a uniform application, and thus the act would be unconstitutional, in violation of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

The court held thata stay of proceedings on a judgment in unlawful detainer by the small claims court was discretionary with that court, and there was no automatic stay of proceedings whether or not an undertaking was filed. However, the court held that actual possession was a most valued right and was an essential part of property, and no one, consistent with constitutional safeguards, could be deprived of the possession or title to property, or any other substantial right, without reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard. The court held that since there was no automatic stay and the defendant could be dispossessed prior to the trial de novo, the 1955 amendment to &sect; 117 was therefore void insofar as it purported to give jurisdiction to small claims courts in unlawful detainer proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Superior Court of San Diego County, California, found that defendant unions' intent was to compel plaintiffs, a lumber business, to require their employees to join one of their unions, and enjoined the unions from picketing and awarded damages to the business. The judgment was affirmed. On certiorari the Supreme Court of the United States ordered that the judgment of California Supreme Court be vacated and the cause be remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court found that the business could not be granted federal judicial relief and, because its business in interstate commerce was less than $ 500,000 per year, the NLRB refused to exercise jurisdiction. The business was caught in a &quot;no man's land&quot; in which no equitable relief could be granted by a state court. The court concluded from the decisions of the United States Supreme Court that the business was without equitable relief under federal law. The court found that the policy declared by the state legislature concerning coercive conduct between employer and employee as to whether the employee should join a particular union is a valid state policy. The court also found that the trial court correctly concluded that by their demand the unions sought to require the business to interfere with the bargaining rights of their employees and force upon them terms and conditions of their employment and labor representation not of their own choosing and that in fact they had rejected. The conduct, the court concluded, constituted an unlawful labor practice contrary to and in violation of state law. The award of damages was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court in part and reversed in part.

The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the public servant, which the court reversed. The court held that an injunction against the alleged activity was proper because the authorization and direction for the use of dictograph surveillance by the public servant was in violation of U.S. Const. amends. IV and XIV, and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. Moreover, the public servant's answer indicated that he intended to continue to engage in the illegal conduct.

The prisoner's habeas corpus petition claimed that the state courts lacked jurisdiction over the offenses for which he was convicted. The court held that the prisoner's allegations were insufficient to entitle him to any relief in the habeas corpus proceeding because, in the absence of exceptional circumstances which were not present, the prisoner was not entitled to contest, in a collateral attack upon the final judgments of conviction, the trial court's determination and exercise of jurisdiction, upon the basis of new and additional facts which did not appear in the trial court record.</SPAN></P>

After receiving an opinion of the attorney general, which concluded that the ordinance was not subject to referendum, the board refused the demands. The court denied the writ, finding that the constitutional provisions that reserved the referendum powers to the people expressly excepted tax levies or appropriations for the usual current expenses of the state. The same exception applied to the referendum powers reserved to the county electors, and, therefore, Cal. Const. art IV, &sect; 1 did not secure to county electors the right of referendum over tax levies for the usual current expenses of county government. It was not disputed that the revenue from the tax was to be used for the usual current expenses of the county, and it followed that the ordinance was not subject to referendum.</SPAN></P>

The church had refused to include in its property tax exemption application the nonsubversive declarations required by Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 32 (1953). The Superior Court of Los Angeles (California) sustained a general demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend. The church appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The church contended that the county tax assessor unconstitutionally denied the church a property tax exemption and that Cal. Const. art. XX &sect; 19 (1952) was an unlawful limitation of its First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Making an oath was contrary to the church's religious beliefs. The court held that the church was not excused from making the oath any more than any other taxpayer because the oath obviously was not a test of the church's religious opinion. If the church objected to making an oath, it had to be for reasons relating to the content of the particular oath and not merely because it was an oath. The limitation on speech was a conditional one, imposed only if a tax exemption was sought, therefore, by no standard could the infringement on freedom of speech be deemed a substantial one. The law demanded the ascertainment of nonexistence of subversion for purposes of taxation, and Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 32 (1953) required the church's cooperation in establishing it. Because the church failed and refused to allege that it had complied with the law, the complaint failed to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

The court found the statutory section constitutional, but found that the commission erroneously issued an award of workmen's compensation against the state fund directly in favor of the employee, rather than an apportionment or reimbursement award in favor of one or more of his employers against whom award in his favor could be made. The court found that in accordance with Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 21, provision for the state fund was encompassed within the legislature's plenary power, unlimited by any provision of the constitution, to create, and enforce a complete system of workmen's compensation. The statute was thus, constitutional.

Upon review, the court observed that the language of &sect; 5500.5 did not expressly permit payments to a carrier. However, various other workmen's compensation statutes made no distinction between an employer or a carrier with respect to reimbursement rights. A legislative declaration stated that in a situation such as the employee's, it was inequitable for total liability to fall on one or more of his employers that were solvent or that had solvent carriers. The court concluded that under &sect; 5500.5, the legislature contemplated reimbursement of the carrier as well as the employer. The court held that reimbursement of carriers where the date of injury occurred subsequent to the effective date of &sect; 5500.5 was not unreasonably discriminatory and was not a gift of public funds. Rather, it was ultimately reimbursement of the employers because the coal mining industry as a whole supported the carriers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the reimbursement award the Fund made to the carriers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1950 the teacher signed a required teacher's loyalty oath, in which he stated that he had been a member of the Communist Party, but that he was no longer connected with it. When the teacher was called before the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities, he refused to answer a number of questions put to him by the committee on the ground of privilege against self-incrimination under the U.S. Const. amend. V. The school board terminated him under the provisions of Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 12604, which provided that refusal to answer questions put to him was insubordination. The trial court upheld his dismissal. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court held that the school board and the trial court incorrectly interpreted the statute as requiring dismissal, without any discretion, once the refusal to answer questions was proved. The court noted that such an interpretation would render the statute unconstitutional, and held that the act contemplated a full and fair hearing on the reasons for the refusal to answer questions, before a decision could be made to terminate.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not err in denying a motion to set aside the indictment on the ground that the foreman did not comply with Cal.

A certified copy of the judgment and commitment was substantial evidence that defendant was undergoing a life sentence at the time of the assault because the Adult Authority had not acted to fix the second degree murder sentence at a lesser term than life. The court found no variance in the indictment and proof and no prejudicial error in the refusal to give an instruction on lesser or included offenses, to admit sections of the penal code, or to grant a new trial based on evidence of which defense counsel was aware at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A state inheritance tax was imposed on transfers from decedents.  Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax.

The trial court rejected appellants' argument, and the court affirmed. The court held that because the entire statutory scheme of the inheritance tax laws and probate proceedings made valuations as of the date of the decedent's death, the law applicable to executor's commissions effective on the date of the decedent's death also applied.

On review, the court reversed and held that it was not concerned with the original complaint or with whether relief could have been granted at that time because the appellant followed the prescribed administrative proceedings available to them and all was done in accordance with city ordinances which required the denial of a license if the business, sought to be licensed violated the state laws against gambling.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The alley was a 10-foot public alley that connected two streets. It was too steep and narrow for vehicular use, and it had always been used solely as a pedestrianway. The homeowner bought a house and lot, which contained a large depression and abutted the alley. The homeowner, without the required permit from the city's director, brought a bulldozer into the alley and used it to level off his lot. He then commenced running trucks in the alley, making it impassable to pedestrians. The director found the condition created by the homeowner to be dangerous to the public. He halted the running of the trucks and installed a post at the entrance of the alley. The homeowner then applied for a permit to build a paved roadway in the alley, which was denied. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that the homeowner's action was barred because he did not exhaust his administrative remedy of appealing his permit denial prior to instituting the suit. The court further held that he was properly denied relief because he did not come into the trial court with &quot;clean hands,&quot; as he ran trucks in the alley without a written permit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayer, a citizen resident of defendant county, brought a suit to challenge the legality of a tax exemption under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 214. The Superior Court of Alameda County (California) declared the exemption invalid. The county and an intervening religious organization appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer challenged that portion of &sect; 214 which granted a tax exemption to property used exclusively for school purposes of less than collegiate grade that were owned and operated by religious, hospital, or charitable funds, foundations, or corporations for nonprofit purposes. On appeal, the court made several findings. First, nonprofit schools owned by nonprofit organizations and operated for the benefit of the public came within the term &quot;charitable&quot; under Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1c. Second, when more than one reasonable meaning of a provision of the California Constitution exists, it is the duty of the courts to accept that meaning chosen by the legislature. This fundamental principle is particularly applicable when, as here, the statute is enacted pursuant to an enabling provision of the California Constitution and there is not only a reasonable legislative construction of that provision but also approval of that construction by the people on referendum. Finally, the exemption did not contravene U.S. Const. amend. I. An exemption of property used for educational purposes may validly be applied to school property owned and operated by religious organizations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment that declared the exemption invalid.</SPAN></P>

At the subsequent hearing, the commission dismissed the misconduct issue because the statute of limitations ran. Employee appealed and argued that his first application for benefits sufficiently presented the misconduct issue to constitute the commencement of the proceedings for the collection of additional compensation.

Petitioner argued that the evidence before the grand jury furnished no reasonable basis for the charges against him and that the trial court expressed bias and prejudice against him in ruling upon his motion to quash the indictment. The court held that Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 5002.5 and Cal. Penal Code &sect; 182(5) were constitutional. The court further held that the evidence showed an elaborate conspiracy to utilize contributions from both retail and wholesale liquor licensees to finance a political campaign and that petitioner was connected with the campaign as more than a donor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the underlying action, the state contended that the fish it regularly stocked in a river died and that 14 people drowned because the power company caused a river's flow to fluctuate through the operation of its hydroelectric plants. The state asserted that the effect constituted a nuisance. After the state intervened in a power company proceeding before the Federal Power Commission, it sought an injunction as to the nuisance. The power company contended that the federal government occupied the field with regard to dams on navigable streams and that the superior court lacked jurisdiction to hear the state's action. The court found that the Federal Power Act (Act), 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 791 et seq., gave the federal government superior rights, such as the regulation of interstate and foreign commerce, and the administration of reservations and public lands. However, it also found that the Act left the states with their traditional subject matter jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court granted defendant's motion on the ground that all the evidence had been obtained by illegal searches and seizures. Defendant was arrested after being found on two premises used for bookmaking. Defendant contended that when he was arrested, the police officers had unlawfully entered the premises in violation of his constitutional rights. Defendant also claimed that he was a stranger who had been hired to watch the premises. The State argued that because defendant disclaimed any interest in the premises, he lacked standing to challenge use of the evidence. The court declined to uphold the order of the trial court. First, the court rejected the State's argument and established a vicarious exclusionary rule, by which defendant had standing to challenge the evidence based on claimed violations of constitutional rights of other persons. The rule was similarly based on the purpose of disallowing the State from using evidence obtained in violation of constitutional guarantees. However, the court concluded that the police officers' conduct did not constitute an illegal entry into the premises. They had reasonable cause to believe that offenses were being committed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order setting aside the information because the evidence obtained as a result of defendant's arrest was not the product of illegal conduct on the part of the police officers.</SPAN></P>

The state presented excerpts of tapes that related to threats, promises, and demands for money that corroborated the testimony of the state's witnesses. Defendant was convicted.

The court stated that the installation of the recording device into defendant's room, which was unconstitutional, was not made lawful by the authorization of the head of the police department or the district attorney. The court stated that it affirmed the one count of conspiracy because the evidence that related to that count was entirely independent of the recordings and convincingly established guilt.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant church members challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which denied the church members a writ of mandamus in their proceeding for review of an order of respondent state Social Welfare Board (board). The board denied their appeals from county board of supervisors' decisions denying them benefits under the Old Age Security Act (Act), Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 2160 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The church members lived together in a home owned by their church, shared possessions, and received a low monthly stipend from the church for necessities. The board found that they were not &quot;needy&quot; persons under the Act because they had voluntarily accepted lower standards of living and any aid they received would be devoted to the church, not to their individual needs. The court reversed the judgment. The board properly made its decision according to the procedures of Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 104, and the church members were not entitled to a trial de novo. However, the findings on which the board based its conclusion that they were not needy were immaterial. The church members met the standards of need as defined in Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 2160 because they were not receiving adequate support from a responsible relative, had not entered into life care contracts, and were not otherwise ineligible. The board's own manual indicated that the Act did not require income received to be expended for particular purposes or in particular amounts. The aid was not an unconstitutional gift of public funds because the care and relief of aged persons was a special matter of state concern.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The widow's husband was found to have contracted silicosis in the course of his employment and disability payments and medical expenses were awarded. The denial of death benefits was based on the ground that the claim was not filed within 240 weeks from the date of injury, even though that period had elapsed before the time of death. The court affirmed. The plain language of the statute sustained the commission's order. The court found that the last paragraph of Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 5406 unmistakably declared a time restriction that was based on two conditions conjunctively applicable. It was clear that the claim for death benefits, having been filed more than 240 weeks from the date of the decedent's injury did not meet the statutory requirement and was, therefore, barred. The court determined that the time limitation was more in the nature of a qualifying condition in the exercise of any right to death benefits. The court concluded that the widow's claim that the application of the statute was an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process had no bearing because her right to recover death benefits was wholly statutory.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute's use of &quot;knowing membership&quot; referred to the person's knowledge of his membership rather than his knowledge of the characterization of the organization. The court found that the teacher's discharge was not because of membership in a proscribed organization but because of his refusal to answer the question. The court distinguished statutes that compelled disclosure of information concerning membership in a proscribed organization from statutes that provided for discharge or disqualification because of membership.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The indictment charged defendant with grand theft, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 487(1), without reference to Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 405. At trial, the trial court instructed the jury concerning the Labor Code section that made it a crime to obtain a bond from an employee and then use the funds for any purpose other than liquidation of accounts between the employer and employee or for return to the employee. The jury convicted defendant on counts where the evidence indicated that defendant had taken bonds from several employees and had commingled the property with his own. The court reversed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a new trial because it found that a charge under the Penal Code could not have been construed to include a charge that he violated a section of a different statute found within the Labor Code. It was impossible in the state of the record to determine whether convictions were based upon a permissible view of the evidence or upon a confusion which led the jury improperly to believe that the alleged offenses were violations of the Labor Code.</SPAN></P>

The adoption of the exclusionary rule opened the door to the development of workable rules governing searches and seizures and the issuance of warrants that would protect both the rights guaranteed by the constitutional provisions and the interest of society in the suppression of crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant took an iron bar and struck a fellow prisoner two blows over the head, cracking his skull. As the result of the extensive skull fracture and brain damage, the victim died that night. The jury found defendant guilty of assault by life prisoner on fellow prisoner, and it also found him sane at the time of the crime's commission. Defendant appealed his conviction and two orders denying his motions for a new trial. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that &sect; 4500 was constitutional in its definition of the element of &quot;malice aforethought.&quot; There was sufficient evidence to establish that defendant was undergoing a life sentence. Though defendant admitted that he committed the assault, evidence of the victim's death was properly admitted. On the issue of sanity, the findings of the two court-appointed alienists were made in accord with defendant's rights as prescribed by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1027. The trial court did not err in instructing the jury on the presumption of sanity. The court rejected defendant's argument that the legal test of sanity based upon knowledge of &quot;right and wrong&quot; should have been changed by overruling the prior decisions.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court found that the city's interest in the tidelands was acquired not as a &quot;municipal affair,&quot; but subject to a public trust to develop its harbor and navigation facilities for the benefit of the entire state and was therefore subject to the control of the legislature. The court concluded that the expenditures by the city for storm drains, a city incinerator, a public library, public hospitals, public parks, a fire alarm system, and many other items were purely &quot;municipal affairs&quot; within the meaning of Cal.

The court found that the proper remedy for reviewing the issuance of a permit, despite protest upon the ground of the unavailability of unappropriated water, was by a writ of mandate pursuant to Cal.  Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 1094.5. The court found that the water company's petition for mandate did not state a cause of action under that section, because it did not allege that the water company had in any manner participated in the proceeding upon the application. The court found that the water company could establish its participation as an interested party in a judicial proceeding to review the department of public works' determination by making a protest to the application before the department of public works and demonstrating the interest in that proceeding. The court found that the trial court abused its discretion by sustaining without leave to amend the demurrers to the original petition, because it was capable of amendment to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county's ordinance made unlawful the emission or transmission of any loud or raucous noise upon or from any public highway or thoroughfare or from any aircraft.

Those that were arrested were members of a farm labor union and by means of automobile horns and loudspeakers were attempting to attract the attention of farm workers to induce them to quit work and engage in a strike to enforce union demands for wages. The representative filed an action on behalf of those arrested to enjoin the enforcement of the ordinance. In reversing, the court found that the decisive question was whether the prohibition of the ordinance was a reasonable one. The court held that it was unnecessary to decide whether an absolute prohibition within the limits of a county or municipality could be upheld, because the ordinance under attack was not of that kind. Accordingly, the court held that the ordinance, upon its face, was not unconstitutional and did not violate free speech rights.</SPAN></P>

The city and county filed a motion in mandamus to compel the city controller to certify the funds. The court denied the city's writ of mandamus holding that the proposed use of the land was not strictly for public use because there would be no stringent government controls over how the property would operate to insure the public interest, and that a portion of the ground floor of the building was to be leased and occupied by retail stores.

The assignee contested this decision precluding his claims based on res judicata of the prior probate court adjudication pursuant to Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 1020.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administrator filed an interpleader complaint in the superior court against the assignee, who claimed a 40 percent interest in the heirs' share in the estate, and also against the heirs, who contended that the assignee had no interest and that the prior probate court determination was res judicata. The assignee contested the adverse superior court judgment rendered based on res judicata due to the assignor's failure to appeal the probate court determination, which was held as binding on the parties on every issue. The court affirmed that judgment because the probate court fully and finally adjudicated all the parties' rights. The court determined that the assignment agreement was based on and included the terms of &sect; 1020.1, which was intended to protect the heirs against the assignee's claims. The court concluded that this agreement's assignment of the heirs' interest in the estate before the distribution was subject to legislation like &sect; 1020.1 that permitted judicial review of the value of the consideration given by the heirs. The court determined that &sect; 1020.1 was not so indefinite in its terms as to render its application here an unconstitutional violation of due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the superior court challenged by the assignee of the heir-hunter's interest in the estate, which was entered for the administrator and the heirs against the assignee. The superior court correctly decided that res judicata precluded the assignee's claims based on the binding, earlier probate court disposition that occurred under the statute.</SPAN></P>

The cement company and lessor sought to enjoin the application of the provisions that would allow the existing business to be discontinued. The trial court determined that the ordinance could not be applied to require the removal of the existing business. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the application of the procedures through the planning commission was subject to review by certiorari or mandamus so that the cement company and lessor had an adequate remedy at law.

The company's main office was situated in the city's limits but the company's manufacturing and production plants were not. The company claimed it was not subject to the city's business license tax, because Los Angeles, Cal., City Tax Ordinance &sect; 21.166 did not cover the production and sale of goods. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the catch-all provision of &sect; 21.166 was broad enough to include the company's activities. The court found that the term &quot;selling&quot; as used in &sect; 21.166 was not limited to just businesses that were predominately in sales, but included businesses like the company, that were engaged in fabricating, servicing, and supplying goods for a price. The court ruled that the fact that the company's products did not enter the city limits was immaterial because the actual sales of their products took place within the city's limits. The court held that the city's tax claim for a certain year was barred by the time limitations under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 343.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the writs, holding that a writ of prohibition ordinarily issued only to prevent future judicial acts rather than to undo acts already performed. The right of a corporation to require a shareholder to give reasonable expenses was absolute.

The survivors contended that the trial court committed prejudicial error in instructing the jury and in excluding certain evidence. On appeal, the supreme court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The supreme court found that the trial court erred in refusing to give certain instructions to the jury proffered by the survivors. Cal. Admin. Code tit. 7 &sect; 1753(b) provided that a dump truck was required to be equipped with a horn that was sounded whenever the truck was being operated in reverse. The safety order should have been read to the jury because it established a minimum standard of care in the safe operation of the alleged tortfeasor's truck. The trial court also erred when it failed to instruct the jury as to Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 671(b), which provided that a person was not permitted to back up a vehicle until such movement could be performed with reasonable safety.</SPAN></P>

In the second action, the lessees claimed damages from the lessors for ousting and excluding them from possession of the premises and business, asserting no breach of the lease or agreement. The court found that there had been no breach of the lease or agreement, that the merchandise was not bought in the lessors' name or on their credit, that the levy of the attachment did not breach the lease, that the lessors ousted and excluded the lessees from possession without right, that the lessees had not abandoned the premises or their rights under the lease, and that the lessors were liable in damages to the lessees for their conduct.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence did not support the conviction of theft and that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial. The court held that a promise made without intention to perform was a misrepresentation of a state of mind and thus a misrepresentation of existing fact and was a false pretense within the meaning of Cal.

A certain oil lease was not transferred as agreed to. The court found that Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 834 was not unconstitutional because so long as the basis of a classification was reasonable, the legislature could provide in various types of action that a successful plaintiff could recover attorneys' fees or only a defendant could appeal. The court found that there was no reasonable probability that the action would benefit the corporation. The court found that the amount of security was not unreasonable and beyond the range of judicial discretion. Under &sect; 834 the trial court, within its sound discretion had the authority to fix the nature and amount of the security. The court held that when the stockholder refused to deposit the security for the corporation, the action could not continue against that indispensable party, or in its absence against any other party, and the trial court had no alternative but to dismiss as to all defendants.</SPAN></P>

It was apparent from the record as a whole that the matters of which petitioner complained were before the trial court and that there was evidence which would have supported findings that there was no violation of his constitutional rights in connection with his confession or the search and seizure. He was not entitled in this proceeding to a consideration of claims which were based upon his version of the conflicting evidence and which could have been, but were not, raised on appeal. Likewise, petitioner's contentions that irrelevant evidence was erroneously admitted at his trial and that the prosecution was guilty of misconduct clearly could have been dealt with upon a timely appeal from the judgment of conviction, and such matters were not reviewable in this proceeding. Further, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 480 was constitutional because the Congress did not intend to exclude state legislation from the field of punishing counterfeiting.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff, the State of California, contended that such practices violated the Cartwright Act (Act), Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 16700- 16758. A jury agreed; however, court granted defendants a new trial and plaintiff appealed. Court reversed, holding defendants clearly had achieved price fixing, which was illegal at both common law and according to the Act. Court further held that the provision of the Act, &sect; 16723, on which defendants relied stating agreements securing &quot;reasonable profits&quot; were not illegal was too vague to be given effect and that defendants' additional arguments had no merit.</SPAN></P>

The court held that as members of the unions they would under union rules be in duty bound to advance the cause of the community of interest of store managers and clerks in any dispute or disagreement with their principal. The court held that it was eminently proper that management supervisors, be kept free from the divided loyalty that would be engendered by compulsory membership in the local unions. The court held that the trial court was correct in deciding that the coercion sought to be exercised by the unions under the circumstances of the case was not reasonably related to any legitimate interest of organized labor; that the activities of the defendants were not in the furtherance of any proper labor objective, and that as a matter of sound public policy were enjoinable within the equity jurisdiction of the court.</SPAN></P>

When the trial court held that the property was not within the designated field, the oil producer contended the statutory exception was unconstitutionally vague and that it improperly delegated legislative power to the California Division of Oil and Gas (division). On appeal, the court affirmed because the statute was constitutional. The court found that the statute was not void for vagueness, even though the legislature had not statutorily defined the term &quot;field&quot; used in the exception, because the term had an understandable meaning in the industry. The court found that there was no improper delegation of power because the legislature had evidenced its approval of the division's interpretation and its intent that the division's interpretation would continue to serve as a standard for administrative review by the division when it reenacted &sect; 3605 with no changes during a reenactment of the Act.</SPAN></P>

The employees continued to picket, so they were arrested. The employees filed writs of habeas corpus to secure their release. The court denied the writs. The court found that the Jurisdictional Strike Law applied because the dispute was between two labor organizations involved in a dispute as to representation. The Strike Law afforded the employer the right to injunctive relief. The court found that the Strike Law did not violate the free speech, press, and assembly guaranties of the Constitution.

The act specifically provided that a concerted refusal to work or concerted interference with an employer's business was against public policy when it arises out of a dispute between two labor organizations as to which should have the exclusive right to bargain collectively.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">There was a controversy between a local union that was affiliated with the manufacturer and the union.

The trial court granted a preliminary injunction. The court affirmed and held that the Act prohibited any concerted effort to interfere with an employer's business and that California's jurisdiction was not preempted by &sect; 8(b)(4) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 158, because there was no overlap between California law and federal law. Because federal law did not protect the union's activity, California had the power to regulate the limits of a permissible contest available to the industrial combatants. The local union had preliminarily established that it was qualified and that the employees of the manufacturer had joined the local union voluntarily. Therefore, the manufacturer was entitled to preliminary injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff board of dry cleaners (board) challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which dismissed the board's action for injunctive relief against defendant dry cleaning business for alleged violations of the Dry Cleaners' Act of 1945 (Act), Cal.

The dry cleaning business sought a demurrer based on the ground that the minimum price provisions of the Act were in violation of the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The trial court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the price fixing provision of the Act was invalid because it was not, by any recognized or recognizable standard, an enactment that provided for the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Because the Act conferred legislative authority upon a board composed of members who were directly interested in the operation of the regulatory rule and its penal provisions without a guide for the exercise of the delegated authority, the court found that the board and the price schedule violated the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Owners and operators contended that the statutes in question involved an improper exercise of the police power, depriving them of their property without due process of law. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the regulation of price advertising was a proper exercise of the police power. The court held that in reviewing legislation for the purpose of testing its propriety as an exercise of the police power, the power of the court was limited to determining whether the subject of the legislation was within the state's power, and if so to determine whether the means adopted to accomplish the result were reasonably designed for that purpose, and had a real and substantial relation to the objects sought to be attained. The court concluded that it was apparent upon its face that the primary purpose of the legislation was the prevention of misleading advertising, which purpose had long been deemed a proper subject for the exercise of the police power. The court held that although the right to advertise was a property right, the requirement of full disclosure of price and brand name was a reasonable method of regulating gasoline advertising.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Before the state took title to the 80 acres, the land was assessed to one defendant as an undivided part of 120 acres owned by him. After defendant conveyed the entire parcel to his wife, who failed to pay the taxes, the property was placed on a delinquent tax list. Three years later, 40 acres of the land was conveyed by defendants to a third party, who in turn conveyed the acreage to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs then redeemed the 40 acres under the partial redemption statute,&nbsp;Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect;&sect; 4146- 4155. When plaintiff applied for such redemption, the assessor placed a separate valuation on the part sought to be redeemed for each tax delinquent year. The remaining acres were valued at the difference between the original valuation and the valuation placed on the 40 acres. Thereafter, the state took title to the remaining 80 acres under a tax deed. Subsequently, plaintiffs bought the 80 acres from the state and then filed their action to quiet title to it. The court held that the proceedings during and after partial redemption were not void and that the assessor properly valued the properties. The court further held that the partial redemption statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

When the employees refused, they were discharged for insubordination. The court held that the employees were not required to speculate upon what the courts were to determine in the future and that, under the contested provisions, the employees were required to name only those organizations that they knew advocated the overthrow of the government with force. As such, the court held that the requirement was sufficiently certain to be understood and applied, and that the employees were properly required to furnish information as to memberships in organizations that, to their knowledge, had advocated the overthrow of the government. The court noted that the statements were similar to the oath prescribed by the Levering Act, Cal. Govt. Code &sect;&sect; 3100-3109, which had been upheld in court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant next contended that if trial on the murder charge had been had before a court sitting without a jury, the trial court would have had to adjourn the proceeding after a finding of guilt until his status as a sexual psychopath had been determined. The court held that this argument was based on the erroneous assumption that sexual psychopathy was a mitigating circumstance.

He contended that the Alien Land Law had been invalidated by the U.N. Charter and that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The court reversed the lower court's judgment. The court held first that the U.N.

However, the court determined that the Alien Land Law violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the statutory classification of aliens on the basis of eligibility to citizenship was suspect because it in fact classified on the basis of race or nationality.

The court found that one charge of theft was not connected to the other charges, and that there had been no commitment order. The court held that the district attorney did not have the power to file an information as to that theft charge under &sect; 739, and it was contrary to the protection afforded by Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. However, the court found that a commitment order had been ordered with regard to the other two charges, which arose out of the same transaction. The court held that &sect; 8 and Cal. Penal Code &sect; 739, protected the criminal from trial on those charges until probable cause was established. The court ruled that the evidence at the preliminary hearing failed to show probable cause for the second charge of theft.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, tort victims, appealed the judgments of the superior court of Alameda County (California) which denied plaintiffs', tort feasors, motion for a new trial modified the judgment against defendant, tort feasor husband, and entered a jury verdict in favor of defendant, tort feasor wife, in plaintiffs' action for damages related to personal injuries sustained in an automobile accident caused by defendant, tort feasor husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, tort victims, challenged the authority of the trial court to deny its motion for a new trial in the subsequent modification of the judgment against defendant, tort feasor husband, when it increased the amount of damages that defendant, tort feasor husband, was required to pay plaintiffs. Plaintiffs additionally challenged the trial court's entry of the jury verdict in favor of defendant, tort feasor wife, in plaintiffs' action for damages sustained in a car accident. The court reversed the judgment for defendant, tort feasor wife, and against defendant, tort feasor husband. Defendant, tort feasor wife, was not able to avoid liability for damages resulting from the accident, as she was the sole registered owner of the automobile and she was unable to show that she had not consented to use of the vehicle by defendant, tort feasor husband. The trial court's assessment of damages was an invasion of plaintiffs' right to a jury determination on the issue of damages, as the assessment was speculative and uncertain. As the assessment of damages was speculative and uncertain the court would only have been allowed to modify the judgment with the assent of both parties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment for defendant, tort feasor wife, and against defendant, tort feasor husband, as defendant, tort feasor wife, was liable as a matter of law for any injuries resulting from the negligent operation of her car by defendant, tort feasor husband, since she was the owner of the vehicle. Additionally, the trial court improperly modified plaintiffs', tort feasors, award without their assent.</SPAN></P>

He contended that the judgment in the Missouri proceeding was a final determination that the action of the State of California in releasing him to Illinois was a pardon. The court denied the writ application. The Missouri court did not purport to determine the effect of the inmate's release in California. The only fact determined there was that the circumstances were not sufficient to justify extradition. The Missouri court did not have jurisdiction to determine the merits of the release in California. The evidence supported a finding that the inmate went to the Illinois prison voluntarily under a conditional parole and that the jurisdiction of the State of California over him continued. When the inmate accept parole, he was bound by the express terms thereof.</SPAN></P>

Agric. Code div. 4, ch. 10, plaintiff challenged the validity of the order. Plaintiff claimed that the order was arbitrary, unreasonable, and unconstitutional. The court affirmed the denial of plaintiff's request for declaratory relief, finding that the order issued by defendant did not violate plaintiff's equal protection rights as the order applied to all milk distributors within the state. The court also held that plaintiff's economic losses were due to its choice not to process milk in the market area and the losses of plaintiff were not a barrier to the validity of the order which was a valid exercise of the police power. The order was a reasonable regulation effecting the marketing of milk within the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Wildlife Conservation Act (Act), 1947 Cal. Stat. 1325, created the board to study and determine the areas in the state most suitable for the preservation of wildlife and gave it the power to authorize the acquisition of such areas by the Fish and Game Commission (commission). The state controller claimed that the Act was unconstitutional because pursuant to Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 25 1/2, the legislature had no authority to delegate to anyone except the commission any powers relating to the preservation of wildlife. The court issued the writ to compel payment because there was no suggestion that the amendment was intended to prohibit the legislature from exercising other powers not delegated. The policies and principles behind the amendment's adoption indicated that the legislature was not to be restricted to acting through the commission in legislating the wildlife field. The constitution was not a grant of power, but was a limitation upon the legislature's powers. Any doubt of the legislature's power to act was to be resolved in the legislature's favor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On several occasions, the racetrack owners refused to admit the citizen to their racetrack. The citizen sought an injunction to restrain the racetrack owners from refusing to admit him. The trial court denied the injunction.

The court found that there was no evidence that the citizen while on the course was or ever had engaged in illegal activities or in an attempt to commit a crime. Under any proper construction and application of Cal. Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 51-54, the mere suspicion, based on past conduct and alleged reputed activities off the course, or on unsubstantiated conversations held on the course with persons considered questionable, did not justify the ejection or exclusion of the citizen. The court found that it was not the legislative intent to vest authority in the racetrack owners to determine primarily and in every instance what persons or classes of persons were sufficiently moral to be admitted to the course and thus be permitted to engage in lawful gambling. The court noted that the objective of &sect;&sect; 51-54 was the protection of the public.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The banks filed separate actions for the refund of taxes paid by each of them under the Bank and Corporation Franchise Tax Act (Act), 1929 Cal. Stat. ch. 13, for the taxable year of 1943. The commissioner had conducted a hearing pursuant to the Act in order to fix the rate at which banks and financial corporations would be assessed for the taxable year. After the rate was set for banks and financial corporations, the banks sought to review the returns of nonfinancial corporations used by the commissioner in determining the banks' rate. The commissioner refused because the Act prohibited the disclosure of tax return information. The court granted the board's petition for writs of prohibition of the trial court's order to produce the returns, finding that the banks were not denied due process. The hearing held pursuant to legislative direction was a quasi-legislative function and not a quasi-judicial function that required a judicial type hearing. The court held that the Act permitted a hearing within the prescribed limits, among which was the confidential status accorded the returns of nonfinancial corporate taxpayers granted by the specific terms of the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state argued that the trial court erred when it allowed the bank to introduce evidence to show that an investigation made at the time of the creation of the lien would have demonstrated that the vehicle owner was a person of moral responsibility and of good repute. The bank did not allege that any investigation was made pursuant to Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11620. Section 11620 required a reasonable investigation prior to the creation of the lien as one of the elements which had to be proved before the court was permitted to release the bank's interest from the forfeiture. The court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court found that at the time the bank's interest was created, the bank was without knowledge that the vehicle was being used for the unlawful transportation or concealment of narcotics. However, the bank's interest in the vehicle was forfeited, along with that of the owner, because the required investigation was not made. The forfeiture statute afforded the bank, as the lien claimant, the opportunity to protect its interest and when the bank failed to do so, the bank could not complain that its constitutional rights were invaded by the forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the commissioner denied the corporation's request to issue stock below the regulation par value, the corporation requested a copy of the record, but then waited almost three months before obtaining it.

Although under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 11523, the record for the appeal must be requested within 30 days after the decision and may be extended 5 days if there is a delay in the record. The trial court decided that the corporation commenced the appeal in a timely fashion and decided that Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 25511 was unconstitutional and so reversed the commissioner's decision. On appeal, the court reversed and found that whichever time limit was applied, the corporation had far exceeded the time limits because of its own delay and so was time-barred from the appeal. The court also found that restrictions the regulations applied to horse-racing were legitimate under code sections and that the legislature had singled out horse-racing intentionally since all other gambling was banned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs had a contract with an irrigation district that entitled them to take water diverted by the irrigation district into a creek. The riparian owners erected certain obstructions in the creek and diverted water for their irrigation of their own lands. Plaintiffs filed actions to enjoin the riparian owners from diverting water from the creek. The trial court granted permanent injunctions. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that plaintiffs had a contractual right to the water that was diverted into the creek. Nevertheless, the court concluded that to the extent that plaintiffs could not beneficially use the water delivered into the creek, they could not prevent its appropriation by anyone who could beneficially use it, including the riparian owners. The court determined that &sect; 67 of the California Water District Act did not authorize the water district to capture or retain water in a natural stream when it had no use for the water and could not find a willing purchaser. The court ruled that because this error appeared only in the trial court's conclusions of law and was not repeated in the judgments, it did not require a reversal or modification.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the board's denial of the corporation's application was supported by competent evidence despite the admission of other improper evidence regarding the proposed track's affect on other area tracks. The court also held that because the board's decision concerned its discretionary powers to determine an applicant's fitness to engage in a business subject to regulation, the court would not interfere with the decision absent the board's abuse of discretion.

The tax, which excluded pool halls where no admission was charged and charitable, religious, and educational organizations, was imposed in addition to an existing business license tax. Plaintiff theater owners sought a declaratory judgment that the tax constituted double taxation, was discriminatory, and was not validly enacted. The trial court determined that the tax was valid. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the mere fact that the state had imposed one excise under one act did not prevent the state from imposing another excise upon the same privilege for the same period. The court also held that it was within the legislature's power to separately classify places of amusement for the purpose of taxation. The court further held that the tax proposition as stated on the ballot was not misleading because the general purpose of the tax was adequately covered in the title and the detail on the ballot of the method of computing the tax was incidental and could be disregarded.</SPAN></P>

Individuals filed a cross-complaint in intervention. The trial court held that the ordinance was constitutional, valid, and enforceable. Plaintiff appealed and the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The ordinance considered in relation to defendant's accomplishment of a plan of community development, showed the challenged regulation to have had been reasonably adopted in furtherance of the general welfare, and plaintiff's individual liberty in the disposition of his property could be curtailed in the public interest. The court held that plaintiff was not allowed to divide his property into individual units for conveyance to separate individuals, but that his transactions in violation of the ordinance were not void, but voidable under the Subdivision Map Act, Cal.

The court held that the nondiscretionary death penalty applied to a felon who, while serving an indeterminate sentence with no fixed maximum term of years, committed an assault under &sect; 4500. The court found that no portion of the prisoner's life term had been remitted, but before the prisoner committed the assault, the adult authority had considered the matter of fixing his term and had declined to reduce it to a term of years. The authority's action was not arbitrary, repugnant to traditional concepts of fairness, or designed to destroy defendant. The court held that the fact that the prisoner was not allowed to present evidence as to his state of mind did not amount to a refusal of his defense, but only a rejection of some evidence concerning the defense. The court ruled that there was no discrimination so there was no equal protection violation. The court found that the imposition of the death penalty was not cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The motorists filed a personal injury complaint after they were involved in an automobile accident with the driver. According to the motorists, the accident was caused by the driver's negligence. The motorist's complaint alleged that at the time of the collision, defendant was an employee of the State and that the automobile that the driver was operating was owned by and being driven with the State's consent. In response to the motorists' complaint, the driver demurred on the ground that the complaint, as amended, did not state a cause of action in that it failed to allege compliance with the claims provision of the Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 1981. After the trial court sustained the driver's demurrer, the motorists appealed. On appeal, the motorists argued that the filing of a claim pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 1981 was not necessary because they sought to hold the driver personally liable. However, the court held that the claims provisions of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 1981 did not apply to claims against the public agency, but only those claims against public employees and officers. Furthermore, the court found no valid constitutional basis for holding that the Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 1981 was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant widow challenged the ruling of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which denied her proceeding in mandamus to compel respondent retirement board (the board) to pay her a pension. The court sustained the board's demurrer and dismissed the widow's action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The widow contended that her husband's service under the 1937 provision of the County Peace Officer's Retirement Law, 1931 Cal. Stat. 268, &sect; 11, gave her, as a third party beneficiary, a separate vested right to a widow's pension, which a 1941 amendment, 1941 Cal. Stat. 745, to the retirement law destroyed. The widow further argued that even if she did not have a separate, vested right to a pension, the 1942 amendment exceeded any permissible modification of her husband's pension plan. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling and held that the widow was not entitled to a pension. In so holding, the court found that 1) the grant of a pension to a member's widow was an increase in benefits which could be taken away before the right vested by the happening of the event calling for the fulfillment of the grant; 2) the widow did not acquire a vested interest in the pension plan until it became payable to her; 3) any one or more of the pension benefits could be eliminated prior to the time they became payable; and 4) the deletion of the provision under which the widow would have been entitled to a pension was not an unconstitutional modification of the county's retirement plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court upheld the trial court's dismissal of the widow's action and the denial of her request for a writ of mandamus compelling the board to pay her a pension. The court held that any one of the pension benefits could be eliminated prior to the time they became payable and the deletion of the provision under which the widow would have been entitled to a pension was not an unconstitutional modification of the county's retirement plan.</SPAN></P>

The newspaper argued that the victim neither complied with the retraction provisions of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 48a nor established special damages as required by the statute. The victim argued that &sect; 48a was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim's libel action was dismissed on the newspaper's demurrer because the victim did not first comply with the retraction provisions of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 48a or adequately plead special damages as required by the statute. The court denied the victim's argument that &sect; 48a violated Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 or the United States Constitution for the following reasons. First, the State constitution did not automatically create a cause of action; it merely recognized limitations to speech as recognized by the common law or as created by the legislature. Second, it was within the constitutional authority of the legislature, for public policy reasons, to limit or restrict libel actions or to extend privileges to newspapers as a special class. Third, if the legislature determined that a retraction was a better remedy than a judgment, that policy determination, even if unsound, could not be thrown out by the court unless it was clearly unconstitutional. Any regulatory exercise by the legislature, the court held, may limit or enhance the rights of some classes over that of others if done so with a reasonable relationship to the intended social goal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This action was commenced by the state to enforce the statutory liability of a legal publishing company for use taxes levied as the result of its sale of law books and legal periodicals to California customers during the period of July 1, 1935, to December 31, 1939 pursuant to the California Use Tax Act of 1935. The publishing company argued that there was a bar on the collection of the taxes due to a statute of limitations on a portion of the tax claim; the unconstitutionality of the tax levy in relation to its mail order sales as a burden on interstate commerce and in violation of the due process clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court stated the present action was commenced well within the authorized period and the statute of limitations did not operate to bar all due tax collections, only those made prior to October 15, 1937. The court also stated that there was no violation of the commerce clause involved in the requirement that that an out of state seller of goods collect a use tax on goods sold for use within the state. Therefore, the tax was not a burden on instate commerce and the court affirmed the decision of the superior court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that he was entitled to a writ of prohibition because the evidence presented before the grand jury was insufficient to show that he had committed any crime. Defendant also alleged that the criminal conspiracy statute,&nbsp;Cal. Penal Code &sect; 182, was unconstitutionally vague. The court rejected the insufficiency argument, noting that the decision of whether or not to indict an individual was left to the province of the grand jury, and that a court could not substitute its judgment therefor. The court also pointed out that the level of evidence necessary to satisfy an indictment was less than that required to convict an individual. While the latter required a showing of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to all elements of the offense, the former was satisfied through probable cause, which the court defined as that state of facts that would lead a man of ordinary caution and prudence to believe and conscientiously entertain a strong suspicion of the accused's guilt. The court, reviewing the language of &sect; 182, found it sufficiently definite to satisfy the requirements of due process.</SPAN></P>

The tax commissioner rejected the corporation's computation of franchise taxes for two years and recalculated the taxes. The corporation paid the additional taxes under protest and filed an action to recover them. The trial court ruled in favor of the commissioner. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the commissioner's method of computation of the taxes did not violate the corporation's constitutional rights. The commissioner had discretion granted by statute to use a three factor formula in calculating the corporation's net income earned in its unitary business, which did not take into consideration purchases and expenses of manufacture. The legislature's grant of such discretion did not constitute an unlawful delegation of power and the commissioner's order to the corporation to use a five factor formula did not preclude the commissioner from using a three factor formula, which fairly calculated the corporation's activities within and outside the state.</SPAN></P>

The motion was denied 50 days later, but the order of denial was not entered in the minutes for another eight days. Notice of appeal was filed on the 26th day after entry. Respondent contended the appeal should be dismissed as having been brought too late. The court agreed, holding that normally, the effective date of the denial of a motion for new trial was the date of the minute entry, and the 30-day period within which notice of appeal could be filed under Cal. R. Ct. 3(a) did not begin to run until such entry; however, the motion had been denied by operation of law under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 660 before the date of the minute entry. Therefore, the 30-day period in which to file the appeal was calculated from the date of denial of the motion by operation of law; and the appeal was filed after the expiration of that period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was found not to be insane, and writs of habeas corpus and certiorari were denied, the execution of his death sentence was set. Defendant's mother, on his behalf, filed a petition for a writ of mandate to compel the warden to institute a Cal. Penal Code &sect; 3701 proceeding to determine defendant's sanity by a jury. An alternative writ was issued and the trial court found that there was no reason to believe defendant was insane, discharged the alternative writ, and vacated the stay of execution. On appeal, defendant claimed that because he had previously been found by a jury to be insane, he was presumed to be insane until a jury found him otherwise and that he was entitled to a right to a trial by jury under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 3704. The court noted that to obtain such relief, his proper remedy was the proceeding for mandate. But upon the application for the writ itself he was not entitled to a trial by jury; only when he had obtained the writ could he have such a trial. The court found defendant had failed to show any &quot;good reason&quot; why the warden should initiate an inquiry. The judgment denying the remedy allowed by &sect; 3701 was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A tentative map for the subdivision of the landowner's land was submitted to the city planning commission pursuant to the Act. The planning commission attached four conditions to which the landowner objected, whereupon he appealed to the city council. The city council upheld the conditions. The trial court upheld the decision of the city council and the court affirmed. The court held that where no specific restriction on the city council's power was contained in the charter, and none forbidding the particular conditions was included either in the Act or the city ordinances, it was proper to conclude that conditions were lawful. The court held that it was the landowner who was seeking to acquire the advantages of lot subdivision and upon him rested the duty of compliance with reasonable conditions for design, dedication, improvement, and restrictive use of the land. The requirement for the dedication of land to the widening of existing streets was not a compulsory taking for public use because it was a condition reasonably related to increased traffic and other needs of the proposed subdivision; thus, it was voluntary in theory and not contrary to constitutional concepts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the city council upholding the conditions imposed upon the landowner in developing his subdivision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The public utility contended that the trial court improperly limited the amount of water that it could take from the ground in a certain area and improperly placed the burden of curtailing the overdraft proportionality on all parties. The court held that the trial court had authority to limit the taking of ground water for the purpose of protecting the supply and preventing a permanent undue lowering of the water table. The court also held that the rights of all the parties, including both overlying users and appropriators, were mutually prescriptive. Accordingly, the court held that the rights were of equal standing, with none prior or paramount. The court also held that the record indicated an actual adverse use of the disputed water, with an invasion of the rights of both overlying owners and appropriators. Furthermore, the court held that the owners of water rights were injured by additional appropriations made after all surplus waters were taken and that they were clearly entitled to obtain injunctive relief to terminate all takings in excess of the surplus. Finally, the court held that there was sufficient evidence that the rights of prior were invaded and damaged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company financed and kept chattel paper on the trucker's acquisition of two semi-tractor trailer rigs, one of which the company had earlier repossessed, for use in establishing the trucker's commercial carrier. The repossessed truck later broke down and proved to have had its serial numbers illegally tampered with. When the company commenced repossession action against the trucker for nonpayment, the trucker filed suit, alleging fraud, violation of conditional sale contract statutes, and usury. The trial court entered judgment against the trucker, and he appealed. The court held that: (1) the trucker's fraud claim properly failed because, rather than relying on the representations of the company's agent, the trucker made a satisfactory independent examination of the diesel; (2) the parties' transaction violated the California law applicable to conditional sale contracts because the company's contracts did not conform with the controlling, mandatory terms of Cal. Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 2981- 2982; and (3) the company did not commit usury under California law because the Personal Property Brokers Act did not fix a maximum interest rate on such loans exceeding $ 300.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners in a 12-block strip had been cited for violations of the former zoning ordinance. The matter was held in abeyance pending plans for a comprehensive rezoning of the city. When the property was rezoned for similar commercial uses, the property owners challenged the zoning. The court found that there were undisputed facts that supported the planning commission and the city council in refusing to extend the boundaries of the light industrial zone. Thus, whether the 12-block strip was suitable for commercial uses or only for light industrial purposes were questions addressed to the legislative authorities, and their decision would not be disturbed if the matters were fairly debatable. Similar characteristics in adjacent and surrounding areas did not preclude the zoning authorities from placing adjoining territories in different zones. The court found that as a matter of law under the circumstances of this case that the ordinance was not unreasonably related to the interests of the community, or that there was an unwarranted interference with property rights in zoning the 12-block strip.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that evidence of the oral admissions of codefendant ought to have been viewed with caution.

The court rejected defendant's contention, finding that the murder conviction was proper because the only issue before the court was that of defendant's sanity since he had pled not guilty by reason of insanity to the murder indictment. The court ruled that defendant's constitutional rights were protected because the trial court informed defendant that his plea would result in his admission of the commission of the crime and because defendant was represented by counsel. The court held that defendant was not entitled to a jury trial to fix the degree of the crime after his plea because the trial court was authorized under Cal.

Code &sect; 60, which stated that all marriages between those races were illegal and void. The applicants contended that the statutes were unconstitutional. The court found that the right to marry was a fundamental right and that legislation infringing on that right had to be based upon more than prejudice and had to be free from oppressive discrimination to comply with the constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection of the laws. The court held that Cal. Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 60 and 69 were not only too vague and uncertain to be enforceable regulations of a fundamental right, but that they also violated the Equal Protection of the Laws Clause by impairing the right of individuals to marry on the basis of race alone and by arbitrarily and unreasonably discriminating against certain racial groups.</SPAN></P>

Due to the prosecutor's misconduct, the court found that it was impossible to determine whether the findings as to the degree of the homicide were based on improperly admitted evidence and improper evidence from questions asked and comments made by the prosecutor and whether the death penalty was arrived at the by the jury in the exercise of a sound discretion based upon the case facts or was inflicted because of passion aroused by the misconduct. The fact that the wife made an extrajudicial statement that earlier she had a feeling that the killing would occur was not competent evidence and should not have been admitted. The state's efforts to introduce evidence about the wife's perception of the stabbing when she was not present was prejudicial and could not be repaired by an order to disregard.

The court held that the district was authorized to annex or include additional land within its boundaries. The district was not really empowered to interfere with the counties' taxing power and process. By virtue of art.

The Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) determined that the telephone company had a valid franchise from the state and denied the county's request for an injunction. The county sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The telephone company argued that it had been granted the privilege to maintain its lines on highways by Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 536. The county argued that &sect; 536 was not applicable, and alternatively, if it was applicable, it violated the California Constitution and the United States Constitution. The court found that &sect; 536 was intended to offer the grant of a franchise to telephone as well as telegraph companies and that by constructing and operating communication facilities, the companies agreed to the terms of the franchise. The court concluded that &sect; 536 was not unconstitutional reasoning that because the offer of a franchise in &sect; 536, when accepted, resulted in a binding agreement supported by a valid consideration, there was no gift within the meaning of the constitutional prohibitions contained in Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22 and 31. Furthermore, the court noted that a statute that classified citizens differently did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. amend XIV, when there was a reasonable basis for the classification and that there was ample justification for treating corporations differently from individuals in this instance.</SPAN></P>

The notary public argued that the provision creating the limitation was a special and local law and that there was no rational basis for setting San Francisco County apart from other counties. The court ordered that a peremptory writ of mandate be issued in favor of the notary public, holding that the provision for the limitation on the number of notaries for San Francisco contained in &sect; 8200 was invalid. The court found that the limitation was arbitrary and without any reasonable basis. The court concluded that there was no reason why the number of notaries for all the counties except San Francisco should be subject to the public needs as determined by the governor, while San Francisco's needs were determined by the legislature as to the maximum but not the minimum.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff lessor challenged a judgment of the District Court of Appeal, Third Appellate District (California), that reversed a judgment declaring a lease of commercial real property in California to defendant Japanese corporation, as lessee, was violative of the California Alien Land Act, 1921 Cal. Stat. p. lxxxiii, Cal. Gen. Laws, Act 261 (1921), and consequently void and of no effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1944, plaintiff lessor filed an action to have a movie theatre lease to defendant Japanese corporation declared void in violation of the California Land Act (Act), after the Treaty of April 5, 1911, U.S.-Japan, art. I, 37 Stats. 1504, referenced in the Act was abrogated. The trial court held that the lease was void. Defendant appealed and the court of appeals reversed the judgment, holding that the Act incorporated the provisions of the Treaty as it existed on April 5, 1911, and that the abrogation of the Treaty in 1940 had no effect on the operation of the Act, which, therefore, still permitted a lease of real property by a Japanese corporation. The court granted a hearing for review, in which plaintiff argued that to construe the Act's reference to the Treaty as specific rather than general rendered the Act unconstitutional. The court held that it would not decide a constitutional question where other grounds were dispositive and that the court of appeals had correctly disposed of all issues involved. The court adopted the court of appeals judgment with the deletions and additions set forth in the opinion and denied plaintiff's petition for rehearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was convicted of violating Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 216 in that, having the ability to pay, he willfully refused to pay wages due to three of his employees. The judgment of conviction was affirmed on appeal and petitioner sought discharge on habeas corpus. Petitioner claimed the statute conflicted with the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 15. He also argued that the justice who presided at his trial acted without authority and the conditions on which suspension of the jail sentence depended were beyond the judge's power. The court found petitioner was accused of violating Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 216(a), which meant he failed to pay his employees when he knew he had the means to do so. Such a conviction constituted a &quot;case of fraud&quot; falling within an exception to the constitutional prohibition. The imprisonment penalty did not violate the constitution. Moreover, the acts of the judicial officer were not subject to attack on the grounds of lack of authority in a habeas corpus proceeding where no objection to the authority of the acting justice was raised in the trial. The conviction was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant barber college was operated by a sole owner with a part-time bookkeeper and student barbers who received commissions from their haircuts. Respondent, California Employment Stabilization Commission (commission), made a finding that these persons were employees for purposes of the Unemployment Insurance Act (Act), 1935 Cal. Stat. 1226. The barber college brought a proceeding in mandamus in the trial court to compel the commission to vacate its findings. The trial court dismissed the proceeding, and the barber college appealed. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court determined that &sect; 45.11(d) of the Act prohibited any injunction, writ, or other proceeding to challenge the findings until the assessed contributions had been collected. The court also determined that the Act was constitutional because the college had no right to mandamus review of this action and the legislature had the power to create rights and remedies without infringing on the judicial branch.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to a change in policy, the county tax assessor taxed the veteran's property based on its cash value.

The department asserted that the new policy was interfering with the department's sale of property to veterans. The veteran and the department claimed that mandamus was the appropriate remedy and argued that the public property was exempt from taxation. The county tax assessor alleged that the veteran was the equitable owner of the property and that it was assessable to him at its full value. The court held that: (1) Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 15 did not apply to ad valorem taxes assessed for local purposes and did not preclude the issuance of a writ of mandamus; (2) the retention of legal title to the property by the department did not exempt the property from taxation; (3) equitable title and right of possession passed to the veteran under the executory contract of sale with the department; and (4) the property was properly assessable to the veteran in possession.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administrator, who was the resident heir of the deceased, sought a final accounting of the deceased's estate. There were two additional heirs who were nonresident aliens and citizens of Germany. The superior court ordered the entire estate to be distributed to the administrator as the sole heir of the deceased and held that the nonresident heirs were not entitled to any part of the estate because their rights were forfeited under Cal.

The superior court denied the motions. The United States appealed and the court reversed, ruling that &sect; 259 was not a forfeiture statute but law of succession, which merely placed limitations on the rights of aliens to inherit. Pursuant to the 1925 treaty with Germany, 44 Stat. 2132, which was not incompatible with the Trading with the Enemy Act, 40 Stat. 411, 50 U.S.C.S. app. &sect; 1 et seq., the nonresident heirs were entitled to their share of the estate and the United States, as the alien property custodian, was entitled to claim the shares by reason of the vesting order.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the appeal from the judgment denying a new trial and the motion to vacate judgment as moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The cousin testified that he was a resident of California, that the decedent was also a California resident, that no will was found, and that decedent died intestate leaving a wife and four adult children. The wife and children were aliens residing in Italy. The cousin testified that he was the only relative of the decedent residing in the United States. He alleged that he was entitled to letters in preference of the public administrator because the wife and children were nonresident heirs and were not entitled to succeed to the estate pursuant to Cal. Prob. Code &sect;&sect; 259. 259.1 and 259.2. The trial court ruled that the code sections were unconstitutional and that the Italian heirs were entitled to the estate. The court found that the trial court erred in adjudging that the code sections were unconstitutional as an invasion of fields reserved to the federal government. The cousin established a prima facie case showing a right to the letters. Under &sect; 259, the burden of proving reciprocal inheritance rights was on the nonresident aliens. There was some proof that the cousin was entitled to inherit the estate, and it was error to deny him appointment as administrator.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The racing board issued a suspension of the trainer's license to train horses after a stimulant was found in the urine of one of his racehorses. The trainer sought a writ of mandamus that was issued once the racing board failed to answer the trainer's complaint after the racing board's demurrer was overruled. On appeal, the racing board again attacked the sufficiency of the trainer's petition and the trainer asserted that the Board's Rule 313, codified at tit. 4, Cal. Adm. Code, &sect; 1930 (Rule 313), was unconstitutional because it made a trainer the absolute insurer of a horse's condition. The court held that Rule 313 was not unconstitutional but was an appropriate exercise of police power by the state over racing and the wagering on it. The strict liability the rule imposed was for the condition of the horse. The application of strict liability did not create any presumption that the trainer was the person administering drugs to the horse because fault was not at issue in Rule 313. The trainer did not dispute his position of trainer or that a stimulant was found in the urine of his horse. He was strictly liable under Rule 313 and a suspension was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent homeowners had judgments against them and appellant sheriff sought to execute the judgments by the sale of respondents' homes. The trial court ruled that the homestead statutes protected respondents and enjoined appellant from executing the judgments. On appeal the issues concerned legal arguments as to whether the homestead statutes in conjunction with the execution statutes violated the California Constitution or the equal protection clauses of the state or federal Constitutions. The court examined the constitutional and statutory language that purported to control the situation. The court held that the homestead exemption was of purely statutory origin and that the legislature properly carried out the mandate of Cal. Const. art. XVII, &sect; 1. The court indicated that respondents were not automatically protected under the constitution but rather had the responsibility to take affirmative steps under statutes that allowed protection. The court concluded that the homestead statutes in conjunction with the execution statutes did not violate the equal protection clauses of the state and federal Constitutions. The order of the trial court was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order of the trial court that prevented appellant sheriff from executing judgments against respondent homeowners by the forced sale of their homes was reversed because the homestead exemption was of purely statutory origin and there were no automatic constitutional protections.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant adopted a resolution declaring its intention to provide road improvements and maintenance service in an area and levy a tax upon taxable property in the area to provide for the service. Defendant then adopted a resolution calling for a special election in order to submit to voters in the service area the question whether the maximum tax rate in the area should be increased to pay for the service. Plaintiffs sued defendant, asserting that defendant's actions were invalid because, among other things, defendant's resolution authorizing road improvement and maintenance was in excess of its jurisdiction. The court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint, and plaintiffs appealed. The court held that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 25210.4 authorized the establishment of a county service area for the purpose of providing within the area any other governmental services, referred to as miscellaneous extended services, which the county was authorized by law to perform. Therefore, because road improvement and maintenance were traditional governmental functions rendered by counties, those functions constituted miscellaneous extended services within the purview of &sect; 25210.4.

Plaintiffs also sought preliminary injunctions enjoining defendants from enforcing the Act. Defendants filed a cross-complaint against plaintiffs seeking injunctions ordering plaintiffs to comply with the Act. The trial court denied plaintiffs' application and granted defendants', and all parties appealed. The court held that on appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction, the scope of inquiry was limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion, and the burden was upon the appellant to make a clear showing of that abuse. Here, plaintiffs made no such showing, but argued only the merits of the controversy. Denial of plaintiffs' application was, therefore, affirmed. However, because the granting of defendants' application had the effect of enforcing the order denying a preliminary injunction, it was, therefore, void and was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals affirmed appellant's conviction. The state had a greater interest in deterring crimes which disrupted the marriage relationship than in other classes of crime; thus, the classification did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. V. The legislature was not bound, in order to adopt a constitutionally valid statute, to extend it to all cases which could possibly have been reached, but was free to recognize degrees of harm and to confine its regulation to those classes of cases in which the need was deemed to be the most evident.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment in favor of respondents and additionally held that the applicable code provisions constituted a denial of due process. Appellant sought review, and the court reversed. The court first found that respondents failed to exhaust their administrative remedies; therefore, they were precluded from filing suit for recovery of the assessments paid. If an administrative remedy was provided by statute, it had to be invoked and exhausted before judicial review of the administrative action was available. The court noted that an exception to exhaustion was where the available remedy did not meet the requirements of due process. The trial court erred in determining that there was such a denial here.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants operated several mobile home parks. Whenever a park tenant sold a mobile home through a mobile home broker, defendants charged the broker a flat fee before allowing the buyer to move into the park. The state filed suit against defendants, alleging that these fees were being charged in violation of Cal. Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 789.7 and 789.8. The trial court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting defendants from charging the fees, and defendants sought review. The court affirmed. Defendants alleged that the language of the statutes did not apply to fees charged to brokers but only prohibited the charging of additional fees to tenants. The court disagreed. Looking at the intent of the legislature in passing the statutes and at the plain and ordinary meaning of the statutes' language, the court concluded that no fees were to be charged in connection with the transfer or sale of a mobile home where no services were performed by park management in the sale. Defendants did not show that they had performed any special services in connection with the sales; therefore, the fees were improper.</SPAN></P>

Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 5701.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff owned a race horse on which she had to pay a municipal license tax. After paying the taxes, she filed a claim for refund on the ground the taxes were preempted by the property tax assessed pursuant to Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 5701. Defendant denied her claim for refund, and plaintiff filed suit. The trial court sustained defendant's demurrers and dismissed the complaint. Plaintiff appealed, and the court affirmed. The character of a tax had to be determined by its incidents and from the natural and legal effect of the language employed. Looking at the municipal ordinance, the court determined that what was imposed was truly a license or excise tax or fee and was not a property tax like that imposed by &sect; 5701. The court further held that there was no unconstitutional double taxation because before invalid double taxation could be said to exist, both taxes had to have been imposed in the same year, for the same purpose, upon property owned by the same person, and by the same taxing authority. These conditions did appear here.</SPAN></P>

The municipal ordinance imposing a license fee for plaintiff's ownership of a race horse was not unconstitutionally duplicative of a similar property tax imposed by the state.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In consolidated cases, parents of stillborn children appealed from judgments of a California trial court in favor of defendant doctors and hospital, dismissing with prejudice two causes of action of their medical malpractice complaint, for wrongful death of the children and for plaintiff fathers' emotional trauma in watching the delivery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court dismissed claims of plaintiff parents of stillborn children, in two cases alleging wrongful death of the children and plaintiff fathers' emotional trauma in watching the delivery, against defendant doctors and hospital. The court affirmed, finding that it could review the issues despite the final judgment rule where plaintiff mothers had remaining claims, because both parties sought review. The court concluded that the words of Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 377 were to be strictly construed and, therefore, plaintiffs could not claim wrongful death for an unborn child. Further, &sect; 377 did not violate equal protection. The court found that plaintiff fathers sufficiently alleged physical injury from the emotional trauma from witnessing the delivery, but the shock they suffered was not from their view of the deliveries themselves but from the information given them immediately thereafter that their sons had died during the deliveries. The court found that plaintiff fathers did not have a cause of action because they were voluntary witnesses of the births that occasioned their emotional distress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed, finding that the wrongful death cause of action was properly dismissed because the statute that provided for wrongful death causes of action required that the child be born alive and did not violate equal protection. The court held that plaintiff fathers' cause of action for emotional trauma was properly dismissed because they voluntarily witnessed the births.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent health care providers, a licensed physician and a licensed clinical social worker, prepared and submitted service reports seeking reimbursement from the state for services provided to indigent patients. The service reports were found to be fraudulent because the patients were never seen or treated by either respondent. Most of the patients were not even acquainted with respondents. Respondents were charged with certain felonies under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 72 and Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 14107. The trial court set aside the information, and the state challenged the order. The court noted that respondents' arguments that there were no fraudulent statements made on the claim forms and that the claim forms themselves were ambiguous were without merit. The court concluded that the service reports contained sufficient false statements to fulfill the requisite fraudulent intent of the crimes charged. In addition, &sect; 72 and &sect; 14107 were not unconstitutionally vague because each statute proscribed with certainty the presentation of a fraudulent claim, with intent to defraud, to a public officer or agency.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner criminal sought a writ of habeas corpus to overturn his sentence of five to 20 years for a narcotics offense. Petitioner claimed that his prior conviction should be stricken because the oral pronouncement of judgment did not contain a recitation of the prior conviction and that the sentence under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11350(b), with no eligibility for parole for five years, constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The state contended that with a negotiated plea bargain, it was unnecessary for the lower court to recite findings. The court found that the lower court's intent to sentence petitioner based upon admitted prior offenses was evident because the record was replete with references to the prior conviction and enhancing effect; therefore, the intent was clear, and pronouncement at judgment was not required. The court held unconstitutional a mandatory minimum term before parole under &sect; 11350(b); however, because petitioner did not contend his maximum term was in violation of the constitution, and because the mandatory minimum term was severable from the remainder of the statute, the sentence remained valid. The court denied the writ.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant State Board of Medical Examiners sought review of the summary judgment of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which held that 1973 Cal. Stat. 1132, was null and void because the 1922 Osteopathic Act, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 3600- 1 et seq., precluded the legislature from authorizing appellant with jurisdiction over osteopathic school graduates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1973, the legislature passed a statute, 1973 Cal. Stat. 1132, providing that appellant Board of Medical Examiners could issue a physician's and surgeon's certificate to anyone who obtained an out-of-state osteopathic school and obtained a doctor of osteopathic degree from it. Respondent Board of Osteopathic Examiners filed suit, claiming that the statute was null and void. The trial court held that the statute was null and void. The court reversed the trial court's holding. The court held that the legislature had the power to enact it. A similar law, enacted in 1962, was declared unconstitutional on equal protection grounds by the California Supreme Court, but the court held that only part of that law was held unconstitutional. The 1973 act amended earlier acts, providing for the licensing of new osteopaths under specified conditions. The court held that the title of the 1973 statute did not render it invalid under Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 9. The court also held that the statute's title was not misleading.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's holding that the 1973 statute was null and void. The court held that a 1962 statute which transferred power to license osteopaths to appellant Board of Medical Examiners was only held unconstitutional in part by the supreme court. Therefore, the legislature had the power to enact the 1973 law.</SPAN></P>

Respondent did not challenge the allegation but averred that it was diligently setting terms of all prisoners in its custody.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate was convicted in 1967 for sodomy under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 286. He was sentenced to a term of not less than one year. He was released on parole in 1973 but was arrested within days of release and returned to prison for a parole violation. Petitioner filed a request for writ of habeas corpus, asking the court to order respondent California Adult Authority to fix his sentence forthwith or show cause why it had not done so. Respondent set out for the court a detailed procedure by which it was fixing the term of indeterminate sentences. The court held that petitioner was not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus. While petitioner was entitled at some point to have his sentence fixed, petitioner's claim that if it were done now, it would be fixed at a lesser time than he had already served was not supported by the record because the details of his offense were not known. The court also held that respondent's need for circumspection in fixing sentences mandated that respondent proceed carefully. An inmate's behavior or circumstances could result in a lesser sentence than the one respondent fixed on him, but never a greater one -- hence the need for caution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied petitioner inmate's request for a writ of habeas corpus. While noting that at some point petitioner had a right to have his indeterminate sentence fixed, the court found that respondent California Adult Authority was not acting with less than entire good faith and that any other method of setting terms for prisoners with indeterminate sentences was not apparent.</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellant waived the right to appeal alleged error by failing to make an appropriate objection at trial, however the court continued that it could review any instruction given even though no objection was made in the trial court because substantial rights of appellant were affected.

Approximately 54 percent of the estate was located in Texas, with the balance in California. The maximum federal estate tax credit allowed to the states under I.R.C. &sect; 2011 was $ 3,407,198. Texas has a pickup statute, which takes precedence over its normal inheritance tax, in which the percentage of the estate in Texas was multiplied by the total credit available to all the states. The Inheritance Tax Referee calculated the excess federal credit on the basis of Texas' normal tax and found additional tax owing to the State of California. Respondent filed an objection to the report and the trial court sustained the objection. Petitioner filed a timely appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed because it found that the pickup tax was constitutional as California was entitled to that proportion of the federal tax credit as property within the jurisdiction of California bore to the total estate property.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner sought habeas corpus relief on the basis that &sect; 11500.5 was unconstitutional insofar as it imposed a mandatory minimum of six years before petitioner was eligible for parole; such mandatory minimum was claimed to be cruel and unusual punishment. The court denied petitioner's request for habeas corpus relief, finding that the sentence imposed under &sect; 11500.5 was not cruel and unusual punishment. The court's basic inquiry was whether the six-year minimum was so disproportionate to the crime for which it was inflicted that it shocked the conscience and offended fundamental notions of human dignity. The court looked at relevant factors such as the nature of the offense, as well as isolation of the offender from society, and deterrence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was confined in prison after being convicted of possession of heroin in violation of former Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11500. His sentence was five to 20 years of imprisonment, without possibility of parole for five years, as he had a prior felony narcotic conviction. He sought habeas corpus relief on the basis that &sect; 11500 was unconstitutional insofar as it imposed a mandatory minimum of five years before eligibility for parole; that was claimed to be cruel and unusual punishment. The court denied petitioner's request for habeas corpus relief. However, the court concluded that the provision of &sect; 11500 precluding a second offender from parole consideration for a period of five years, without statutory regard to the existence of such mitigating circumstances as possible addict status of the offender and the quantity of narcotics involved in the offense for which he was tried as well as in the prior offense, was cruel and unusual punishment in violation of Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State of California made it a misdemeanor to advertise offers to procure or obtain, or to aid in procuring or obtaining, any dissolution or annulment of marriage under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 159a. Real party in interest do-it-yourself divorce businesses challenged the law and sought declaratory relief that the law was unconstitutional. The trial court, without an evidentiary hearing, entered a preliminary injunction against enforcement of &sect; 159a as unconstitutional. The court vacated the order holding that &sect; 159a was constitutional on its face based on the record before it. The court held that &sect; 159a was a proper use of the police power by promoting the stability of marital relationships. The court found that &sect; 159a fell within the state's concern that involved the delivery of legal advice. The court found that &sect; 159a continued the presence of a policy against the excitation of vexatious litigation, and that prohibitions against the use of advertising to promote litigation harmonized with this policy. In addition, the court held that the relief granted was inappropriate because the order was made on mere allegations without an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a receiver for a California corporation, brought an action against defendants, a state resident and three Mexican companies, claiming that defendants owed the corporation money for overpayments made to defendants for labor and services. Plaintiff brought a motion seeking a reversal of an order entered by the trial court that released an ex parte attachment of defendant corporations' goods upon defendants' general appearance, which the trial court denied. On appeal of the trial court's order releasing the attachment, plaintiff asserted that he was entitled to the attachment because he was suing on a contract for &quot;money loaned&quot; or &quot;services rendered,&quot; two of the four types of contracts covered by Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 537.1, subd. (a) for issuance of attachments. The court held that because what plaintiff was really suing for was a series of overcharges for work that was never performed and money obtained on a fraudulent representation, his position was untenable, because the clear intent of the legislature was to confine the availability of attachment against resident defendants to four specified types of transactions, none of which was alleged here.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the release of an ex parte attachment of defendant Mexican company's assets by the trial court and affirmed the denial of plaintiff receiver's action to prevent the release of the attachment, where the basis for plaintiff's action had no legal basis in the applicable statute, which authorized release upon defendants' general appearance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent was charged with a violating San Francisco, CA., Police Code &sect; 1291, which prohibited loitering while carrying a concealed weapon.

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the lower court and remanded the cause with directions that the criminal proceedings against respondent be reinstated. Section 1291 was not preempted by California state law that prohibited loitering and therefore, did not violate Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 7. Section 1291 supplemented the state legislation against loitering, which the legislature did not intend to preempt. Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect;&sect; 653(k), 3024, 12020, did not preempt Police Code &sect; 1291 because the state law had not completely covered the proscriptions against knives making it exclusively a state matter. Section 1291 was not vague or overbroad because it gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that in addition to loitering an individual must also be carrying a concealed weapon in order to be in violation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Stanislaus County (California), denying motions to withdraw a plea of guilty and to set aside the indictment pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995. Appellant had pleaded guilty to an indictment charging conspiracy to sell a controlled substance in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 182 and sale of a controlled substance in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11379.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pleaded guilty to conspiracy to sell a controlled substance, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 182 and sale of a controlled substance, in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11379. The trial court denied appellant's motions to withdraw his plea and to set aside the indictment under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1018 in denying appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Considering all factors, the court found no clear and convincing evidence that appellant's plea of guilty was not the result of his free and clear judgment. The court held that the motion to set aside the indictment was properly denied because once appellant entered a guilty plea, his right to contend that the indictment was based on insufficient evidence terminated. Furthermore, a guilty plea was an admission of each element of the offense and, thus, an admission of probable cause. The court held that the entry of the guilty plea was a bar to a &sect; 995 motion. The court found that the sentence was not cruel and unusual in view of the gravity of the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the denial of appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea because appellant was properly advised of his appeal rights and elected to enter a plea and pursue appellate remedies. The court affirmed the denial of the motion to set aside the indictment because it was filed after appellant had entered his guilty plea and therefore, his right to challenge the sufficiency of the indictment terminated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, consul of the Republic of Mexico, was charged with conspiring to commit the crime of soliciting business for an attorney in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 182. He brought suit seeking to restrain respondent superior court from proceeding against him. He contended that the courts of California had no jurisdiction due to the federal courts having exclusive jurisdiction of all actions and proceedings against consuls, and claimed that he was immune from prosecution since the acts complained of were within the scope of his official duties. The court ruled that the federal courts were without jurisdiction to try alleged violations of state statutes. The court also determined that although article 5 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, Apr. 24, 1963, art. 5, 21 U.S.T. 82-85, provided that petitioner may have had the right to assist his nationals in acquiring legal representation, the manner in which such an authorized function was carried out would determine whether the assistance was within the scope of his consular duties. In refusing to issue the writ, the court held that the state trial court was the appropriate forum for such a factual determination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court discharged the alternative writ and denied the request of petitioner, consul of the Republic of Mexico, for a writ of prohibition on respondent superior court continuing criminal proceedings against him. The court concluded that Congress never conferred jurisdiction over state criminal proceedings against consuls on the federal courts or deprived state courts of such jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employee sought review of judgment of Superior Court of Santa Barbara County (California), which dismissed plaintiff's action pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 581(3) after granting defendant employer's demurrer to the defamation claim in plaintiff's first amended complaint and the breach of contract claim in his fourth amended complaint on the ground of failure to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employee filed defamation and breach of contract claims against defendant employer for alleged breach of its oral agreement to lay off plaintiff, which allowed him to obtain unemployment benefits, and to not communicate to third persons that plaintiff was discharged or resigned for dishonesty, theft, and bad employment attitude and that defendant would not rehire him. The trial court sustained defendant's demurrers to the defamation and breach of contract claims, and dismissed without leave to amend. The court held that, with regard to the defamation claim, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 830 violated due process and equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 7 and 15, because its bond requirement in effect deprived plaintiff of property prior to hearing. With regard to the breach of contract claim, the court found that the bargained-for consideration of defendant's silence as to the truth of plaintiff's unemployment was illegal and therefore voided the contract. The court affirmed dismissal of the contract claim and reversed and remanded on the defamation claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the dismissal as to plaintiff employee's breach of contract claim because consideration was based on an illegal agreement to withhold facts from third parties. Dismissal on defamation was reversed and remanded because the bond requirement was an unconstitutional deprivation of property before a hearing.</SPAN></P>

The lower court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment because appellants did not cite and the court could not find any provision of either the state or federal constitution that expressly or impliedly guaranteed the right they sought, which was not to be deprived by the state of the very income one needed to furnish his family with adequate food, clothing and housing. The court held that the right that they sought was not a fundamental right and &sect; 690.6(c)(1) was constitutional because the class of persons that appellants argued was harmed by the statute could not be identified or defined in customary equal protection terms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent city, in response to increasing nudity in public places, passed an ordinance banning nudity in parks and on beaches. Appellant nudists brought an action seeking a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was preempted by state law in the form of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 314, that it violated the U.S. Const. amend. I right to free speech, and that there was no urgency to pass the ordinance. Appellants also sought a preliminary injunction preventing enforcement of the ordinance, which was denied. Appellants sought review. The court affirmed, holding that state law did not preempt the ordinance. The court stated that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 314 proscribed conduct that was sexually motivated. However, the court determined that ordinance did not proscribe sexual conduct but protected the health, welfare, and morals of the community. Since the legislature had not enacted legislation on a statewide basis banning public nudity, there was no legislative intent to prohibit local legislation regarding public nudity, and therefore the ordinance was not preempted. The court further held that the ordinance proscribed conduct and did not infringe on free speech.</SPAN></P>

The affidavits merely pointed to discriminatory behavior that, even if proved, was allowable under the police power. The court determined that the trial court was correct in not ordering a continuance for discovery because the actual intent of the city council in enacting the ordinance was irrelevant and not a fact essential to justify opposition to the motion for summary judgment under Cal.

On appeal, the court held that the California Quality Environmental Act (CEQA), Cal. Pub. Res.

The court held that respondent's determination was consistent with the state and federal constitutions as there was no unconstitutional delegation of legislative power and the right to vote was not infringed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer challenged the constitutionality of a respondent city's business tax, Los Angeles, Cal., Code &sect; 21.108, that imposed a tax on persons engaged in the business of lending money, but did not impose a tax on the business of lending money where the obligation was secured by a lien on real estate. Appellant contended that the distinction between money lenders who made loans secured by real property and those who made loans not secured by real property was an unjust discrimination that violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend XIV. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in favor of respondent. The court held that in view of the essential differences in the methods of conducting a mortgage banking business and a business of making loans not secured by real property, the distinction between the two types of businesses for the purpose of taxation embodied in the municipal ordinance was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The court held that a municipality has broad power to classify for the purposes of taxation and that difference in the method of conducting a business is generally a sound basis for classification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant corporation began waste and dredging operations after it complied with permit and reporting requirements, which limited the amount defendant could dredge per year and required the work to be performed at the same location.

State filed a suit against defendant and sought a preliminary injunction to enjoin defendant from further dredging activity, which the trial court granted, but permitted defendant to continue dredging limited to the original permit, pending further order from the trial court on the matter. On state's appeal, the court held that the trial court did not have the power by injunction to restrain the permit and reporting agencies from enjoining defendant's actions because by policing dredging and waste activities, the agencies were performing official acts, which they were required by valid law to perform.</SPAN></P>

The court held that to the extent that &sect; 851.7 prohibits the sealing of arrest records of narcotics offenses charged as misdemeanors, it was unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection of the laws. The court found no justification for sealing the record of a minor who has been convicted and has received relief under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.4, and excluding from the sealing privilege the record of a minor who has suffered an arrest but who had the charges against him dismissed. The court reversed the order of the justice court denying the petition to seal defendant's records.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no question that the Department's corrected notice of status that increased petitioner's sentencing was an ex post facto punishment. The court held that Cal.

The court held that neither the U.S. Constitution nor the state constitution's free speech clause protected petitioners, because the court had a fundamental right to protect its orders. The court also determined that journalists did not have any more right than the average citizen to disobey court orders. The court further stated that &sect; 1070(a) did protect petitioners from revealing their source, but that it was unconstitutional as applied to court officers, because it violated the separation of powers.

The trial court denied appellant's petition because appellant and respondent had agreed in open court that appellant would support the child until he reached the age of 21. On appeal, the court held that the trial court was without jurisdiction to extend child support payments beyond the age of 18. The trial court's order was made after the effective date of Cal. Civ.

The court found that the ordinance, as written and applied, did not violate the equal protection and due process clauses of the United States Constitution because, although certain entities were excluded from the tax, there was a rational basis and the facts supported the finding of the rational basis. The court also found that the penalty provision of the ordinance did not violate the due process clause of the United States Constitution. The court found that there was no violation because the purpose of the penalty was to induce prompt payment and that it was sufficiently substantial in amount to make sure that result was achieved.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which convicted him, after trial by jury, of attempt to commit second degree robbery, in violation of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of attempt to commit second degree robbery under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 664, and assault with intent to commit robbery under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 220. On appeal, the court reversed as to the &sect; 664 violation because it was necessarily included within assault with intent to commit robbery, and defendant's conviction for both was impermissible. The court held that the lower court did not commit reversible error in failing to instruct the jury that corpus delicti must be proved independent of admission and that it properly instructed the jury that insulting words were no justification. The court found no cruel and unusual punishment because the maximum sentence did not shock the conscience and was not grossly out of proportion to sentences for similar crimes in other jurisdictions. The court held that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in admitting a prior felony conviction of burglary for impeachment purposes because it had bearing on defendant's veracity. The lower court did not err in allowing evidence of a prior uncharged offense of robbery that was relevant to defendant's intent or in allowing a spontaneous statement as admissible hearsay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's conviction for attempt to commit second degree robbery because it was necessarily included within the offense of assault with intent to commit robbery, and defendant could not be convicted for both. The court affirmed the assault conviction because there was no reversible error in allowing evidence of prior wrongs and hearsay or in instructing the jury on intent, and because there was no excessive punishment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, contrary to defendant's contention, specific intent was not an element of the prima facie case for a violation of &sect; 4574, and although the jury was improperly instructed in that regard, such instruction was not reversible error, because it was vastly in favor of defendant. In addition, the court held that proof of defendant's intended violent use of the razor blade was not necessary.

Petitioner's due process and equal protection claims were not reached because the court's conclusion on petitioner's first contention was dispositive of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant accused was found in violation of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6300 by jury trial and committed to a state hospital as a mentally disordered sex offender by judgment of the trial court. On appeal, appellant contended that the preponderance of evidence standard of proof in mentally disordered sex offender proceedings and the lack of a requirement for a unanimous verdict constituted an unconstitutional denial of appellant's Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, U.S. Const. amend. VI and amend. XIV as well as his rights under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, holding that, because commitment under &sect; 6300 infringed on the liberty rights guarded by the constitutions, such commitment on a preponderance of the evidence and without unanimity of the jury did, indeed, infringe appellant's constitutional rights. On an ancillary note, the court observed that the use of the word &quot;dangerous&quot; in &sect; 6300 was not so vague or ambiguous to violate due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for transportation of heroin under 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 174 because the court held that the presumption of guilt arising from possession of the drug was not unconstitutional.

Health &amp; Safety &sect; 11357 violated Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 6.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employee, a public defender, was forced to retire from the service of defendant employer at the age of 65. Defendant had adopted a pension plan that required county employees to retire at age 65. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant.

The court held that the mandatory retirement provisions in question achieved a permissible and logical end. In addition, the means chosen are reasonable and rational. The stated purpose of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 31671.01, the provision upon which defendant's program was based, was to guarantee to all citizens a fair and equal opportunity for employment in the various county offices governed by the provision. In addition, it was designed to establish conditions of employment and to promote economy and efficiency in such offices. The court found nothing arbitrary, discriminatory, or unreasonable in establishing maximum retirement ages.

In a suit brought by respondent environmental group, the trial court held that the project violated the California Environmental Quality Act of 1970 (CEQA), Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 21000 et seq. The court also held that respondent was not barred from a judicial remedy for failing to exhaust administrative remedies because respondent was not a party to the administrative proceedings and because respondent was pursuing public rights. The court found that a 25-page report commissioned by appellant town was inadequate to comply with the environmental impact report requirements of CEQA.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowner, a real party in interest, owned property zoned for residential use. Upon appellant's request, defendant County of Los Angeles rezoned the property to recreational and resort use by ordinance. After plaintiff landowner alleged noncompliance with the California Environmental Quality Act of 1970, Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 21000 et seq., the trial court found the rezoning ordinance void, holding that the saving provisions of Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 21170 did not protect appellant. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the trial court incorrectly interpreted &sect; 21170, which, as the court interpreted the statute, saved or validated appellant if he completed a large part of the project or incurred a large percentage of the total liability of the project. In the court's view, the trial court misinterpreted &sect; 21170's use of the word &quot;substantial&quot; so as to impose too many conditions on the qualification of appellant's project to satisfy &sect; 21170 for application for relief under Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect;&sect; 21169. On remand, the trial court was directed to make new and more specific findings as to the magnitude of appellant's liability incurred in the project.</SPAN></P>
