</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainants, citizens and taxpayers, filed an action against defendants, a county road supervisor, a county trustee, the state attorney general, and members of a county road commission, in which complainants argued that 1947 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 249 violated Tenn. Const. art. 11, &sect; 17 and that it authorized a diversion of funds contrary to the general law. A Tennessee trial court sustained defendants' demurrer. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The private act created a road commission and a supervisor of roads. The court rejected plaintiffs' argument that the act violated Tenn. Const. art. 11, &sect; 17, which provided that a county office created by the legislature could not be filled otherwise than by the people or by a county court. The court agreed with the trial court that the private act had not created an office; rather, the road supervisor was a subordinate employee. It noted that when a statute was capable of two constructions, one of which might render it valid and the other invalid, courts were to adopt the construction that would render an act valid; furthermore, legislative intent was to prevail over the strict letter or literal sense of the language used in a statute, and to carry the intent into effect, general terms would be limited and narrow terms expanded. Next, the court held that revenue derived from state gasoline funds paid over to the several counties authorized the use of such funds for repairing and improving county roads and bridges. The payment of the commissioners' salaries and the expense of maintaining a county garage was not an unlawful diversion of road funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant farmers challenged a decree of the Chancery Court of Davidson County (Tennessee), which declared an amendatory act, 1949 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 650, unconstitutional. The farmers had brought the action against appellees and sought to confine the use of the facilities of a farmers' market to only farmers and not produce dealers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amendatory act sought to amend 1949 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 400, which created a farmers' market for Davidson County, by confining the facilities to farmers and excluding produce dealers. The court determined that there were three ways to uphold an amendatory act: (1) by reciting in the caption of the amendatory act the title or substance of the act sought to be amended, (2) to refer in the amendatory act to a section or sections of an official code, or (3) to set out language in the caption and body of the amendatory act so that a reader was put on notice that the amendatory act or subsequent act covered the same subject and that these enactments were referred to as repeals by implication. The court affirmed and concluded that 1949 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 650 did not comply with either one of the three requirements. Although the rule of in pari materia was of force when the statutes in question were passed at the same session of the legislature, this did not correct a constitutional deficiency. This was a rule of construction and could not run counter to the expressed provisions of the Tennessee Constitution. The amendatory act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a circuit court clerk (Tennessee), brought an action against appellants, Rutherford County (Tennessee), a judge, and others, seeking, among other things, a declaration that &sect; 15 of the 1947 Rutherford County Act, 1947 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 737, as amended, was unconstitutional. The Chancery Court of Rutherford County (Tennessee) granted the clerk relief, and appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 15 of the Act, 1947 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 737, required the County to pay the clerk out of its general funds a certain salary and required the clerk to pay the County court fees that the clerk collected. During his tenure, the clerk accepted for his compensation warrants against the County's general funds. In his declaratory judgment action, the clerk contended that his total compensation was substantially less than the salary allowed out of the fees he had collected and that he was entitled to have the deficit paid out of the fees he had collected. On appeal from the clerk's judgment, the County contended that the dealings between the clerk and the County equitably estopped the clerk from questioning the constitutionality of 1947 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 737. The court found no basis for applying the doctrine of equitable estoppel; the fact that the clerk complied with the statute, as he was required to do as a public officer, did not deprive him of the right to attack the statute's constitutionality. There was also no prejudice to the County because the deficit was to be paid out of a special account that was created pending the outcome of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decree and adjudged costs against the County.</SPAN></P>

The parent had filed a bill that sought an injunction against a the requirement that students attend Sunday School, and a declaratory judgment that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-1307(4) was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A parent alleged in his bill that compulsory attendance at Sunday School and relate religious practices within the public schools were embarrassing and offensive to him and to his said child and were in violation of their constitutional rights. The parent further alleged that such practices were contrary to the religious beliefs and principles of his child and others. The parent's bill prayed for an injunction to restrain the board of education from continuing the practices complained of and to declare Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-1307(4) unconstitutional under Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, and U.S. Const. amend. I and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. On review, the court affirmed. The court held that the reading of a verse in the Bible without comment, the same verse not to be repeated more often than once every 30 days, the singing of some inspiring song, and repeating the Lord's Prayer, was not a violation of the constitution. The court found it more or less difficult to conceive that these simple ceremonies amount to &quot;establishment of a religion,&quot; or any attempt to do so; nor is it an interference with any student's secular beliefs contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that there was no error in the trial court's decree, and affirmed the decree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, mother, father and minor daughter, challenged the judgments from the circuit court (Tennessee), which sustained the demurrers of defendants, a university and two student newspaper, disposing of several lawsuits alleging libel. The cases were consolidated on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents originally brought lawsuits regarding materials published in one of the newspapers. After a second newspaper ran an item regarding the institution of the lawsuits by the parents, the parents instituted more lawsuits alleging a second publication of the allegedly libelous material. On appeal, the court held that the newspapers had a right to publish the contents of pleadings filed in court, although no judicial action had been taken, provided that the publication was a fair and accurate statement of the contents of the pleadings, and was made without malice. However, the court held that by sustaining the demurrers, the trial court had erroneously deprived the parents of the right to a jury trial on the issue of whether the newspaper publications were libelous. The court also held that it was unrealistic and illogical to hold that there had been an invasion of the common law right to privacy because the parents had already made a public record of the matter. As a result, the court affirmed the judgments sustaining the demurrers for invasion of privacy, but reversed the judgments sustaining the demurrers for libel and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments sustaining the demurrers for invasion of privacy in favor of the defendants holding that the parents had already made a public record of the matter, but reversed the judgments sustaining the demurrers for libel holding that the parents were entitled to a jury trial. Thus, the court remanded that portion of the judgments for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that it was fundamental error when a trial court failed to instruct in felony cases on such matters as reasonable doubt, dying declaration, where the facts were admitted, and in felony cases where the State relied entirely upon the circumstantial evidence. The court found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2517 only applied to matters not fundamental in their character, and where it could have been generally understood that the fundamental defenses had been charged generally by the trial judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the general sessions court, defendant was advised of his rights under 1955 Tenn. Pub. Acts 267 (Act), which gave general sessions courts jurisdiction in misdemeanor cases and allowed general sessions courts to proceed with bench trials when defendants waived their rights to an indictment. Defendant pleaded guilty in the general sessions court and waived his right to demand an indictment and his right to a trial by jury. The general sessions court tried defendant's case without a jury as provided by the Act and convicted defendant. In the trial court, the State's demurrer was sustained upon the finding that even upon defendant's waiver of an indictment and a jury trial, the general sessions court lacked jurisdiction to proceed in his case because the maximum fine was in excess of $ 50. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in sustaining the State's demurrer because the Act was valid.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Act, Tenn. Code &sect; 7038 (Supp. 1950) was stricken in its entirety, and an amendment prohibiting advertising was substituted. The court first held that although the Act was &quot;omnibus&quot; legislation in the sense that many code sections were being amended, it was not unconstitutional. The court had previously approved amendment by substitution. Moreover, the caption of the Act, which recited the numbers of every section sought to be amended, was in compliance with the Tennessee Constitution. Next, the court stated that even if sections of the Act violated due process, the court should not decide so until the manner of the Act's enforcement amounted to a denial of due process. The court rejected the optometrists' argument that the Act was invalid because it did not apply to oculists and ophthalmologists. It had been held that oculists and ophthalmologists could be classified separately from optometrists without violating the Constitution. Finally, any constitutional defects in the Act were cured by 1955 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 6, which reenacted the statutes that had been amended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers alleged that 1951 Tenn. Priv.

Acts, ch. 492, which increased the pay of general sessions judges, were unconstitutional. They also challenged an appropriation for a pay increase for election commissioners and other appropriations. The court held that the appropriation increasing the salary of the county judge was proper because it was for his services as a financial officer. The appropriation increasing the pay of the general sessions judges was improper because it violated Tenn. Const. art. 66, &sect; 7. The appropriations for a pay increase for election commissioners and car operating expenses for agency commissioners and the county judge were improper because there was no authority for them. In denying the parties' petitions for rehearing, the court held that public officers could receive no fees or costs except as expressly authorized by law. Further, the court held that the taxpayer could not recover funds paid to the officials because a statute was presumed to be legal until a court held otherwise, and the payments were made under that presumption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his first assignment of error, the inmate argued that he had completed his Florida prison sentence; in his second, he argued that the Florida statute under which he was convicted was void. The court stated that whether the inmate had completed his Florida sentence was a matter of defense in the Florida courts and was not reviewable in Tennessee. As for the second issue, the court held that the constitutionality of the Florida statute was not subject to collateral attack in the courts of Tennessee when the Florida courts were available to the inmate. The inmate could not assume that the Florida court where he was convicted would not grant to him the same relief he sought in this proceeding. Moreover, it would be a dangerous precedent to permit the inmate to invoke the jurisdiction of the Tennessee courts to declare unconstitutional a Florida statute. A demanding state must be the judge of its own laws as well as the proceedings for their enforcement, and the jurisdiction of its courts was exclusive in determining if a person was being deprived of his liberty without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

Acts ch. 570 was unconstitutional. The act repealed 1949 Tenn. Acts ch. 868, which established a Court of General Sessions for Rhea County.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of General Sessions was an inferior court that the legislature had the power to create or to abolish. When it was abolished, it operated to vacate the office of the presiding judge. The court rejected the presiding judge's contention that the repealing act was unconstitutional. The Court of General Sessions was not protected by the Constitution, and the legislature could redistribute its business at any time. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, finding that the trial court erred in holding that the act was unconstitutional based on a line of decisions that only applied to a county judge where his functions and duties could not be devolved upon another. The repealing act resulted in a transfer of the business of the Court of General Sessions to the officers and courts that were divested of such business by the act that created the Court of General Sessions. The repealing act did not purport to devolve the duties of the presiding judge upon any other official or to create any new office or officers. The court overruled the presiding judge's petition to rehear, finding that he was not effectively a county judge because that office had been expressly abolished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents' complaint attacked laws by which the maximum gross weight permitted to be hauled over the highways of the State of Tennessee was increased from 42,000 pounds to 55,980 pounds for certain classes of vehicles. An injunction was sought against defendants from availing themselves of the increased gross weight provisions. An attack was also made on an act dealing with reciprocal agreements concerning use of the highways by non-residents. It was alleged to be unconstitutional and void. Defendants demurred to the bill on the basis that the acts in question were duly enacted and signed, and that the matters contained therein were matters exclusively within the valid exercise of the legislative powers of the State. The trial court granted defendants relief. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The substance of the complaint was that increasing the load limit was invalid for the reason that it was secured by and for the benefit of the heavy truckers, not for the public welfare. Against that, the court found that the state legislature possessed all powers not withheld by constitution. No provision of the state or federal constitution was violated.</SPAN></P>

The association requested an order for a state-organized bar to which every lawyer of Tennessee had to belong in order to practice law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association surveyed its members. A majority responding favored the change. The court said that the purposes of an integrated bar were the forwarding of the administration of justice and the prevention of the practice of law by unlicensed persons. The court noted that only four of the 27 states that had integrated bars put the change into effect by a court order only. In the other states, legislative action was involved. The court noted that 1955 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 54 prohibited basing the right to practice law on membership in an association. The court noted that a third of the lawyers in the state were not members of the association now and were not included in the survey. The court said that approximately 23 percent of the lawyers of the state expressed a desire for integration and about an equal percent affirmatively rejected the idea. Assuming but not deciding the invalidity of the statute, the court said the question was whether an integrated bar was in the public interest. The court noted that the wish of the legislative branch was entitled to great consideration. The court added that no other state supreme court required integration of the bar under similar facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case brought by plaintiff arising out of an automobile accident, defendants filed a petition to rehear. They argued that the court erred in construing Tenn. Code &sect; 8671 so as to give Tennessee courts jurisdiction over nonresident owners and operators of vehicles registered in a foreign state and in holding that it was sufficient that process was served upon the Secretary of State pursuant to &sect; 8671.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accident occurred on the grounds of a hospital. The court first stated that &sect; 8671, and similar statutes in other states, disclosed a general intent to regulate travel upon the highways that was just and fair to residents and nonresidents alike. The United States Supreme Court had broadly sustained the states' power to regulate the use of motor vehicles on their highways. Furthermore, under &sect; 8671, there was an implied consent by a nonresident's use of Tennessee highways that in case of an accident involving the use of his automobile the person injured might have service of process upon the Secretary of State. Next, the court rejected defendants' argument that the statute did not apply because the accident occurred upon private grounds. A nonresident could not claim exemption from service of process upon the Secretary of State for an accident based upon a mere technical distinction between a public highway and a driveway upon private property. To hold that the statute did not apply where a nonresident, after having entered the state over state highways, proceeded onto private property and there caused injury to another would create an artificial and unreasonable distinction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first reaffirmed its holding that it was the legislature's intention to make the Superintendent's position that of an officer rather than of an employee. Had the legislature intended otherwise, it would not have provided that the position be an elective one. Next, the court inserted the words &quot;after September 1, 1954 shall read as follows&quot; into the enacting clause of 1953 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 177, &sect; 1. Doing so, the court stated, would ensure that 1951 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 106, &sect; 1 (1951 Act) remain in effect until the Superintendent was reelected in the summer of 1954. This would maintain the constitutionality of the 1953 Act by having the Superintendent elected by the people as provided by the 1951 Act. The 1953 Act frequently referred to the 1951 Act and enlarged or increased certain things done by the 1951 Act; accordingly, it was the court's duty to read the two acts together and try to harmonize them so that the 1953 Act would have a constitutional effect.

The union was found liable because it gave notice to respondent employer that it would strike or refuse to work with non-union men. In a motion for rehearing, the union argued that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 7811 violated its First Amendment right to freedom of speech and was void. The court affirmed its prior ruling and declined to entertain the unconstitutionality of Tenn.

Each were fined a sum. Defendants contended that the proceedings before the Beer Board were void and that, if not void, there was no revocation of their permits to sell beer because the motion in arrest of judgment was never disposed of, and thus there was no final disposition of the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On a certain date the Quarterly County Court made it unlawful to sell beer outside any town or city within 2,000 feet of any school, church, or other place of public gathering. Citizens filed a petition against defendants for revocation of their permits. The county court, acting as a Beer Board, voted that the permits be revoked. The actions appeared in the formal minutes of the Beer Board. Defendants filed motions in arrest of judgment. No formal meeting was held, but in each case's formal file a paper, dated and marked filed by the clerk, appeared which purported to overrule and dismiss the motions. The deputy clerk testified that she was directed by the county attorney not to enter same on the minutes. The court affirmed, finding that if there was a final disposition of the matter by the Beer Board, then defendants' only remedy under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 1191.14 (Supp. 1950), would have been by common law certiorari. Therefore, they would not be permitted to have a review of the action of the Beer Board by a collateral attack on same for defects and irregularities that would make such action only voidable.</SPAN></P>

The incumbent candidate was elected in 1952 as the Superintendent of Roads and was qualified for the position pursuant to the law at that time. In 1953 and prior to the expiration of the incumbent candidate's term of office, the legislature passed the 1953 Act, which changed the terms for the appointment to the office of the Superintendent of Roads. The incumbent candidate's term of office was for a period starting in September 1952 and ending in August 31 1954. In August 1954, the rival candidate, who was the only candidate for the office of Superintendent of Roads, was elected at that time to that office.

Appellants filed a petition for rehearing complaining of numerous errors. The court noted that appellants' petition was largely devoted to a reargument of the entire case. The court, therefore, only addressed appellants' argument regarding the question of elision. The court held that the doctrine of elision dealt with the question of legislative intent. The general rule was that where a clause was so interwoven with other portions of an act such that the court could not suppose that the Legislature would have passed the act with that clause omitted, then if such clause was declared void, it rendered the whole act null. The court held that there was no valid reason for it to suppose that the Legislature would have refused to pass the Act with the challenged exempting clause omitted. The court concluded that the Act was not arbitrary or unreasonable. Accordingly, the court denied the petition for rehearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a child welfare association and its manager, appealed a judgment from a trial court (Tennessee), which enjoined the association from operating a child caring institution as requested by plaintiff Department of Public Welfare of the State of Tennessee. Defendants contended that 1953 Tenn. Pub. Acts 228, &sect; 4 was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the Department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department sought to enjoin the association and its manager from operating a child caring institution. The chancellor overruled their demurrers and granted the Department's request. On appeal, defendants claimed 1953 Tenn. Pub. Acts 228, &sect; 4 was unconstitutional because the Act did not furnish reasonable guides or standards to guide the Department in promulgating regulations. The Act provided for the regulation of the practice of private individuals who engaged in the business of placing children for adoption or temporary care. The court found that the power conferred upon the Department of Public Welfare was not a legislative power. The Act directed the Department to develop and publish standards in conformity with the points of excellence mentioned in the Act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad company filed an application with the Railroad and Public Utilities Commission for permission to discontinue certain passenger trains operating between Kentucky and Tennessee. The Commission denied the application because the railroad company did not show that the direct operating costs had exceeded the aggregate gross revenue by more than 30 percent. The railroad company filed a petition for certiorari in the chancery court. The chancery court reversed the decision of the Commission in denying the application, and the Commission filed its appeal. The issue presented on appeal was whether the chancery court could make a determination as to what constituted directing operating costs when it concluded that the Commission acted arbitrarily in denying the application. The court found that the chancery court acted outside of its authority and exercised an administrative function clearly within the realm of the Commission when it evaluated the evidence at issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property claimant's grantor had not paid taxes on the property for 25 years. The property was sold for taxes. The grantor executed a quitclaim deed to the property claimant after the State had sold the property. The property claimant asserted that 1947 Tenn. Pub. Acts. 28 was unconstitutional and that he was being deprived of his property without due process. The court denied his petition. The court held that the fallacy of the property claimant's insistence was that the grantor had no title to convey. The entire argument presupposed that the grantor could have maintained an action to recover possession of the property without first complying with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 1611, by tendering the amount of taxes and penalty due, and that the property claimant by virtue of his quitclaim deed succeeded to the same indefeasible right. The court held that the Act assailed could not have had any retrospective effect as to the property claimant, he having no vested interest in the land when the said Act took effect. It was entirely too late for the property claimant to step into the shoes of the grantor and make the defense of a lack of due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The surety company was the surety on a bond executed by a subcontractor on a highway construction project. The subcontractor ran into unexpected difficulties and abandoned the project. The prime contractor completed the work, at a loss, and the surety paid the amount of that loss. In the 1951 State Miscellaneous Appropriation Bill, 1951 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 268, &sect; 2A, the legislature appropriated money apparently to reimburse the surety for its payment, subject to a claim being made and approved by the Board of Claims. The board did approve the surety company's claim but the taxpayers successfully challenged the payment in the lower court. The surety company appealed but the court affirmed, holding that the legislature could not legally have intended to pay the type of claim submitted. The appropriations statute indicated that it was not intending to create any new liability. Therefore, the claim could only have been payable if it was the sort of claim already allowed against the State. The State had never allowed claims to reimburse sureties for payments made on their performance bonds, so the claim made by the surety company was unauthorized.</SPAN></P>

Appellant citizens sought a decree declaring the ordinance unconstitutional. The Chancery Court of McMinn County (Tennessee) sustained the municipality's demurrer and dismissed the complaint. The citizens sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the citizens claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it suspended a revenue statute, which was a general law. They also argued that the ordinance was unconscionable and inequitable because the municipality shared in tax collections from the sale of beer. The court rejected these claims. The court noted that every municipality in the State was entitled to share in that part of the tax allocated to municipalities without regard to whether beer was sold within the municipality. The court also held that the ordinance did not suspend the general law, as alleged. The court found that the enabling statute was a police measure as well as a revenue measure. Further, the enabling statute specifically permitted municipalities to impose restrictions upon the sale of beer to promote public health, morals, and safety. In addition, the court noted that because the sale of beer was subject to unlimited restrictions, it was not relevant that the practical effect of the ordinance was to prohibit the sale of beer within the municipality.</SPAN></P>

The chancellor held that the Act did not apply, considered the carriers' appeal under the procedure for a common law writ of certiorari, and ruled that there was substantial evidence to support the issuance of certificates for three routes. The appellate court held that the Act was applicable and that the evidence strongly preponderated against the commission's finding that public convenience and necessity would have been promoted by issuing certificates to the company over the three routes. The court held that the appellate court's interpretation mistakenly allowed the chancellor to perform an administrative function. The court affirmed the decree of the chancellor and held that the Act only required the chancellor to review the evidence before the commission and to determine whether the commission had acted beyond its jurisdiction, arbitrarily, fraudulently or illegally, which was within the limit of appropriate judicial review under the common law writ.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the city and several of the officers, including the board of aldermen and the mayor, were entitled to absolute immunity for their acts of enacting legislation, even if that legislation was later deemed void.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual was charged with breach of Greenfield, Tenn., Ordinance No. 23 in that she failed and refused to obtain a city license for the operation of an automobile over the streets of Greenfield as required by such ordinance. She was assessed a fine for violation of the ordinance, but the trial court remitted the fine. The City appealed, and the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that it would not decide upon the constitutionality of the ordinance because such action was not necessary to a disposition of the case. Instead, the court held that under a proper construction of the ordinance the individual was not liable for the fine imposed because she was not the owner of the car involved. Use of the phrase &quot;his motor vehicle&quot; in the ordinance compelled the court to construe the ordinance as imposing a duty of registration only on owners of motor vehicles. Because the ordinance imposed a tax or license, it had to be construed strictly against the City and in favor of the individual.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioner demurred to the actions, contending that the franchise and excise taxes were non-discriminatory privilege taxes levied upon all corporations for profit and doing business in Tennessee and that such taxes were imposed for the privilege of engaging in business in corporate form and were in no sense a direct tax upon the obligations of the United States or the income therefrom. The trial court sustained the Commissioner's demurrers. The taxpayers sought review of the trial court's ruling, claiming that a recent opinion of the United States Supreme Court effectively declared that the franchise and excise taxes at issue were illegal because they affected federal obligations and income therefrom.

On appeal, the judgments were affirmed in the criminal court, where the charges against defendants, though presented in five separate warrants, were heard together de novo. The evidence included oral testimony of a police officer that defendants were found with Federal waging stamps in their offices. Defendants had filed applications for the stamps and received a grant to receive wagers. They paid the required tax for the stamps. The city, however, had an ordinance prohibiting gambling even under federal stamps and the city charter permitted a Tennessee city to prohibit gambling. A city ordinance established that payment of a gambling tax under a federal stamp was prima facie evidence of a violation of the city ordinances. The court found that, because the action was a civil claim for the recovery of fines only, the city met the required burden of proof and the trial court order was proper.</SPAN></P>

The record disclosed that after the jury had been sworn in, it was discovered that a juror had been rendered infamous and was discharged. The court affirmed and held that the infamy of a juror was properly a cause of propter defectum. A second juror's ex-wife made a statement that the juror stated to her that defendant would never serve a day for the crime. The court affirmed the trial court's discharge of the juror and found that the juror had not only formed an opinion in the case but he had prejudged it and certainly was not a fair and impartial juror. The court held that when a legal necessity arose during the course of the trial that made it imperative that a juror be discharged, defendant's double jeopardy rights were not violated. The court held that the trial court was invested with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict, whenever there was a manifest necessity for the act, and that the defendant was not thereby twice put in jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bill alleged the enactment of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 10725 et seq., commonly known as the Anti-Fee Bill (Act), which limited the official's compensation to the fees of his office up to a prescribed level. It asserted that the official procured the passage of private acts fixing a different salary in conflict with the Act. It alleged that he knew that those laws were unconstitutional but fraudulently and illegally procured numerous payments under them 18 to 30 years earlier. The official demurred on laches grounds, citing a 10-year statute of limitations, and on estoppel grounds, claiming that the funds were paid under acts that were merely voidable and not void. He filed an answer not waiving the demurrer. The court found that a demurrer admitted no matters of law suggested in the bill or inferred from the facts stated and that the laws complained of had not yet been held unconstitutional. The official's reliance on the private acts was safe until proper advice of their unconstitutionality, and the court found no fact showing coercement or fraudulent procurement. The court found no presumption that any judicial or county official knew that the disputed laws were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was assessed, pursuant to &sect; 1316, an additional excise tax for the privilege of doing business in corporate form in Tennessee. The lower court dismissed the taxpayer's bill challenging the assessment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court conceded that the Act was retrospective to a degree, but determined that the retrospectivity did not in and of itself render the Act invalid. The court noted that the Act did not impair the obligation of a contract or operate to divest rights to any vested interest and found that taxing statutes were generally held to be constitutional even though they had some retroactive effect. The court decided that, regardless of whether the Act was retrospective or prospective, it was constitutional. The court concluded that the lower court was correct in holding that the tax was due. The court rejected the taxpayer's contention that the excise tax was a state tax upon a federal tax and therefore imposed a burden upon the federal government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The changes made by the Act under attack in the system of road construction and maintenance were substantial. The Act formulated an entirely new system for the working and maintenance of the roads of Henderson County under the direction of commissioners and a supervisor who was to be employed by the commissioners. The complainants claimed that the Act legislated them out of office in such a manner as to violate Tenn. Const. art. 11, &sect; 17. The court disagreed and upheld the constitutionality of the Act. The mere fact that a person held a public office whose duties were strictly confined to county affairs, and whose salary was paid by the county, did not make it a county office as contemplated by art. 11, &sect; 17. That section of the Constitution referred to vacancies occurring immediately upon the creation of the county office.

The chancellor sustained a demurrer to the bill. The railway company appealed and argued that the Validating Act, 1951 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 276, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railway company alleged in the bill that the County Court of Rhea County adopted a budget and tax levy for the year 1949, which provided for the taxation of taxable property within the county in excess of the amount allowed by Tenn. Code &sect; 1045.1. That statute only authorized counties to levy a tax of 40 cents for general county purposes. The railway company claimed that a levy of 85 cents was excessive. The railway company paid the excess amounts under protest and filed suit. The trial court held for the county. On review, the court affirmed the decree of the trial court. The validating act passed by the legislature allowed the additional tax of 45 cents. The validating act was constitutional because it specifically stated the purpose of the additional assessment. The court concluded that the act did not impair any contracts in violation of Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20 or interfere with any vested rights of the taxpayers within the county.</SPAN></P>

Where the assessment was to provide revenue for both general and special purposes it had to denominated a tax as distinguished from a special assessment; if the money collected was used for some purpose other than as a direct benefit to the land assessed, it was a tax. Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 29 expressly forbade the legislature from delegating to a subordinate agency, such as the board, the power to levy such a tax. If the Act allowed the board to divert the funds of the district to the support of projects that were initiated by federal agencies, regardless of special benefits to such lands, it violated &sect; 29.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer sold food items through an automatic vending machine. Because no device had been discovered where the burden of the tax could be passed on to the consumer when goods were sold through vending machines, the Commissioner permitted the operators of the machines to pay the tax on the basis of the wholesale cost of the merchandise, instead of the retail selling price. The taxpayer paid the sales tax under protest and sought a refund of the amount paid. The court found that the taxpayer was engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail and as such, it was exercising one of the privileges made taxable by the Tennessee Sales Tax Act. The court rejected the taxpayer's argument that it should not be required to pay the tax because it was unable to pass the tax onto its customers under the Commissioner's bracket system. Furthermore, even though certain businesses were unable to collect the tax from the consumer, the tax did not violate the Equal Protection or Due Process clauses of the United States Constitution because there was no arbitrary discrimination between the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

The agent contacted the company about selling the cotton dusters to jobbers and that he had lined up a sale if the company would permit him to sell to a jobber. The company told the agent it would get back to him but then went to the jobber's customer and sold the dusters itself. The court affirmed. The proof showed beyond any question of doubt that the agent had lined up a purchaser who was a jobber for a customer and that the company contacted the customer directly and sold the dusters. The company would not be permitted to unjustly enrich itself by its own variation of the contract at the expense of the agent. After the agent had found a customer and commenced negotiations, neither the company nor the customer could break them off and defeat the agent's right to his commission.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainants asserted that 1951 Tenn. Pub. Acts 245 was invalid because the caption of the law claimed it was an amendment, while effect of the law was to repeal all or parts of specified sections of the Tennessee Code and to enact other provisions in lieu of those repealed. The court affirmed and held as follows: (1) the recitation in the caption of the specific section of the Code to be affected by the legislation was a sufficient compliance with the constitutional requirement that the subject of the legislation be expressed in the title; (2) so long as the new Act, in all its provisions, had to do with the Mining Laws, it was germane and relevant to the subject of its caption because the draftsman gave more notice than was required by stating that all the Code sections which were to be affected by the legislation were a part of the Mining Laws of Tennessee; (3) amendment by substitution was a common legislative practice; and (4) the Act was to be given liberal construction to carry out the purposes of its passage because it was remedial legislation to improve the working conditions of miners in the mines in Tennessee.</SPAN></P>

Pub. Acts 9. The Court of Appeals of Tennessee transferred the cause to the court because it involved a constitutional question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The practitioner contended that 1947 Tenn. Pub. Acts 9 was unconstitutional because the body of the Act was broader than its caption. The court rejected the practitioner's contention because a casual reading of the Act showed that its body was not broader than its caption. The court concluded that the Act was valid and constitutional. The court also rejected the practitioner's contention that the chancellor had no authority to enjoin violations of the Act because such violations were also declared to be a misdemeanor and punishable by a fine and imprisonment in a county jail. As the practitioner was not being criminally prosecuted, he could not complain that he was in double jeopardy for the same offense. The chancery court had jurisdiction to grant the injunction. Although the practitioner was fined, that fine was for his contempt of a temporary injunction and not for the violation of the Act. Thus, he suffered no double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a judgment of the Criminal Court of Knox County (Tennessee), which sustained defendant's motion to quash an indictment charging a violation of Tenn. Code. &sect; 7944a. The State contended that the indictment, which set out the offense in the terms of the statute, was not vague and indefinite.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment charged that defendant applied funds given to him on account of improving certain real property for his own use instead of using them to pay for labor or materials furnished in connection with the improvement. It did not charge the specific amount of money applied to defendant's own purposes or who the unpaid laborers or materialmen were. The court held that it was not necessary to allege such matters. The rule was that it was not necessary to allege values unless a specific value was an element of the offense or went to the punishment for the offense. The crime described by &sect; 7944a was similar to embezzlement and there was no requirement that the specific amount embezzled be alleged in an indictment for embezzlement. The indictment contained the elements of the offense and sufficiently apprised defendant of the charge so that he could prepare a defense. It was sufficiently definite to prevent a subsequent prosecution for the same conduct. That was all that was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant was elected as the county superintendent on several occasions and held the office for two-year terms. There were two legislative acts that affected the office of county superintendent. One, 1943 Tenn. Pub. Acts 36, provided that a county superintendent should be elected for a four-year term. The other, the Private Act, provided that in the county in which complainant held his position, the county superintendent should be elected for a two-year term. Complainant was aware of the discrepancy but did nothing to challenge the confusion created until after defendant was elected. Complainant had been elected several times and served two-year terms after the effective date of the Private Act. The court reversed. Complainant was estopped to question the constitutionality of the Private Act under which he was elected to hold his office. Complainant accepted the operation of the Private Act and did nothing to clear the situation created by the two legislative acts. Complainant's conduct bore out the insistence that he was entitled to two-year terms of office. Complainant took and held his office under the Private Act and he was estopped to attack its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers challenged 1951 Tenn. Priv.

Campbell County sought to issue certain bonds, which was challenged by petition. 1951 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 625 was enacted by the Tennessee Legislature to allow Campbell County to execute the bond issue despite voter opposition. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the taxpayers' complaint and ordered that Campbell County's demurrer be overruled on remand. The court held that 1951 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 625 was in violation of Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8 as arbitrary and capricious discrimination amongst the counties of Tennessee. 1951 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 625 impermissibly granted powers to Campbell County alone, which conflicted with the mandates of the County Recovery and Post War Aid Act of 1945 at 1945 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 184.</SPAN></P>

In so ruling, the court noted that the clerk was being paid in accordance with the provisions of applicable legislation at the time he went out of office and that the clerk never made a final accounting with the county pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 10742 for the reason that certain criminal cases were pending on appeal at the time the clerk left office. Because that final accounting had not yet occurred, the court held that the chancellor erred in ruling that the clerk was estopped, and it ordered that the chancellor was to determine the constitutionality of salary provisions in 1939 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 390, and amendments thereto, and was to determine what amounts were owed between the parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city sought to have the trial court insert two amendments in the General Education Bill, 1951 Pub. Acts 132, which were not in the bill signed by the speakers and the governor. The trial court determined that because the house amendments were not a part of the enrolled bill and not signed by the speakers and the governor, they were not law. The trial court also held that because the senate amendments, though incorporated in the enrolled bill, had not passed the house, that under the doctrine of elision, they should be struck down, and the rest of the bill approved. The court concluded that (1) under the constitution, the mere passage of a bill by both houses of the legislature, did not constitute legislative due process, nor make a law; (2) the enactment of a statutory law was complete only after combined action of the legislature and executive branches of the government; and (3) not only was there no presumption that the legislature would have passed the statute as elided, but there was the contrary presumption that the legislature would not have passed the statute as elided.</SPAN></P>

The State contended that the 1949 Act was arbitrary and capricious in that there was no valid reason for singling out the butane and propane dealers as a particular class of taxpayers to he the lone recipients of benefits conferred by the Act. The court affirmed and held as follows: (1) the class of persons entitled to benefit by application of 1949 Tenn. Pub. Acts 235 included all persons who were in a like situation, all persons to whom the State owed the moral obligation to repay money illegally collected as fees; (2) Tenn. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's son was involved in an accident while using her car. A damages action was brought against the owner, who had no liability insurance. When the owner did not deposit an amount to secure payment of any judgment, her registration was revoked pursuant to the Act, and a patrolman removed her license plates. Her action sought to have the Act held unconstitutional, to have the Department restrained from canceling her registration, and to have the patrolman prohibited from withholding her license places. On appeal of the sustaining of the demurrer, the court noted that the official residence of the Commissioner was not in the county of suit. The patrolman was the only resident of the county of suit. Because the owner's right to the return of the license plates and to freedom from interference by the patrolman was entirely dependent upon whether she was entitled to the relief she sought against the Commissioner, the patrolman was not a material defendant. The action was thus not within the jurisdiction of the chancery court in the county where the owner filed the action.</SPAN></P>

It was not questioned that the present action was a transitory action; that is, one that might be brought anywhere as distinguished from a local action. The legislature in adopting Tenn. Code &sect; 8640 expressly provided that transitory actions might be had where a defendant was found unless otherwise expressly provided. The act creating the Law Court of Humboldt County, 1868-89 Tenn. Pub. Acts 22, was not inconsistent with the general law governing transitory actions because, in enacting that law, the legislature enacted it and provided in the last words of the act that it should apply unless it was otherwise provided.

The Commission had no alternative other than to authorize the discontinuance of train service when the provisions of the Act were met. If the rights of the traveling public were impaired the courts were powerless to provide a remedy by mere judicial pronouncement. The caption had given full notice of its objects as well as the nature of the proposed legislation, and the retroactivity of the statute had not rendered it unconstitutional. Common carriers were privileged to avail themselves of its provisions immediately upon its passage, and could rely upon loss of revenue and cost of operation during the 12 month period preceding the passage of the Act.

The trial court entered orders dismissing the actions. On appeal, the court reversed the orders and entered a judgment in favor of the taxpayers requiring the refund of the sales and use taxes paid. The court held that (1) state taxes on independent contractors with the United States government were subject to collection, and the contractors themselves had no implied immunity; (2) the express immunity from state and local taxation granted to the Atomic Energy Commission under &sect; 1809(b) of the Atomic Energy Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1809(b), extended to the &quot;activities&quot; of independent contractors who performed services on behalf of the Atomic Energy Commission; and (3) the taxpayers were exempt from the use and sales taxes because they related directly to activities that the Atomic Energy Commission carried out through its contractors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chancery court declared that as to the intervenors 1949 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 348 was constitutional in amending the Charter of the City of Nashville, Tennessee, 1947 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 246. Appellants sought review, insisting that 1949 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 348 violated Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 17 because the provisions of the body of the Act exceeded the scope of the Act's caption. The court agreed, explaining that when the body of an Act went far afield and introduced things into the Act which were incongruous with the caption of the Act then the Act was violative of &sect; 17. The restrictive provision in the caption of 1949 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 348 was: &quot;to provide certain benefits for widows of pensioned employees.&quot; The body of the Act went far beyond this and provided benefits to widows of all city employees and to children and mothers under certain circumstances. These provisions should not have been included in the Act. The court held the Act was unconstitutional and that 1949 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 604, which attempted to amend 1949 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 348, was also unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Complainants also sought a declaration as to the validity of the Act insofar as it changed the charter provision of the city regarding the holding of elections in that city. The court held that holding a bond election as specified in the challenged Act was an exception to the general or broad provision of the city charter applying to the ordinary city elections. The charter provisions permitted those living outside of the city to vote in city elections. The challenged Act did not permit those living outside the city to vote in city elections. The court concluded that the Act was constitutional and that the lower court erred in enjoining an election under the Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the insane person was a party to the insanity decree rendered by the trial court, and that the trial court had jurisdiction over the matter. Accordingly, the insane person was not able to successfully challenge the judgment by a writ of habeas corpus because the invalidity of that decree did not appear upon its face or in the record. The conclusive presumption was that the requisite statutory provisions were followed. The insane person alleged that she was not in fact taken before the county court and that the guardian ad litem was not a lawyer, nor capable. Since the insanity decree and the record in which that decree was rendered did not affirmatively disclose such allegations to be the facts, it followed that the contrary of those allegations had to be conclusively presumed in the collateral attack on that decree. A trial by a jury under the Insanity Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4436 et seq., was not mandatory unless demanded by the guardian ad litem or the party. The record did not affirmatively disclose such a demand. Thus, it had to be conclusively presumed upon the collateral attack that no such demand was made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended that the selection and composition of the trial jury was illegal and unconstitutional because two of the jurors who heard and decided the case had served as regular jurors on previous panels within two years of the trial.

The trial court disallowed the challenges and held that the jurors were qualified under the express provisions of 1931 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 556. The principal question was whether the Act was constitutional in that it provided that it should not be cause for challenge that persons have served on regular juries within two years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant, widow of a deceased pensioned employee, filed an action against defendant county to recover the benefits provided for her as such widow by 1949 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 806, amending 1943 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 274. The county filed a demurrer insisting that the widow was not entitled to benefits. The Circuit Court of Davidson County (Tennessee) overruled the demurrer. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county insisted that the widow was not entitled to benefits because the Act violated the single subject clause of Tenn. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17, in that the body of the Act was broader than the caption because it included dependent minor children or mother as beneficiaries, if there was no widow surviving the pensioned employee. The trial court held that the provisions in the body of the Act applying to children or mother could be elided without destroying the integrity of the Act. The court held that it was illogical to presume that the Legislature would not have provided for the widow except on condition that if she be dead dependent children or mother should receive the benefits that would have gone to her had she survived her husband. The Legislature would have enacted the statute notwithstanding omission of the provisions with reference to dependent children or mother. If those provisions were elided, there still remained a complete law capable of enforcement providing for the widows of deceased employees who came within the Act. Therefore, the portion of the statute providing the benefits for the widows of such employees was a valid enactment and enforceable by the widow.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment of the trial court so as to pretermit an actual determination of the constitutionality of the Act with reference to benefits to dependent children or mother of an employee coming within the Act. As so modified the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Instead of terminating policemen and firemen, the city and plaintiffs entered into a voluntary agreement to reduce wages by ten percent, even though ch. 692 of the Private Acts of 1927 prohibited reduction below a certain level. In some succeeding years, salaries were reduced by more than ten percent. In 1947, plaintiffs brought suit to recover the reductions. The trial court found that duress existed and granted relief to plaintiffs. The city appealed and the appellate court found that the agreement was voluntary, there was no duress, and the statute of limitations required dismissal. Plaintiffs appealed on, inter alia, the ground of an amendment to the Private Acts of 1927 by ch. 467 of the Private Acts of 1935 that would allow recovery. The court found that there was no duress as the plaintiffs obtained the benefit of no terminations in exchange for the salary reductions. Further, the court found that plaintiffs were estopped from their bringing their suit. The court also found that the amendment did not apply retroactively.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainants invoked a 1928 city ordinance to support their contention that the station was not allowed. The ordinance prohibited service stations near residences in certain parts of the town. Defendants property was within the district defined in that ordinance. Defendants relied on a 1948 city ordinance that enacted a complete zoning code with permitted uses defined and limited. The 1948 ordinance did not expressly repeal the 1928 ordinance. Complainants contended that because the 1928 ordinance was more restrictive it should have been applied. The court adopted the chancellor's opinion that held that the paramount intention of the city council was to pass a zoning ordinance, and not to revitalize and revive the ordinance of 1928, which was repealed by implication. The 1948 ordinance allowed the building of the station. Therefore, defendants could build their station.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Entering a plea of guilty, the inmate submitted a bond without sureties for the assessment of fines and costs which provided that he was liable for arrest and delivery to the municipal workhouse for failure to pay the bond. Therefore, when the costs and fine were not paid when agreed on, the inmate was re-arrested and placed in the municipal workhouse. Finding that the trial court went beyond its authority in releasing the inmate on what amounted to his own recognizance, the court held that the city had only been authorized to release the inmate or suspend the fine when the inmate gave a bond with sureties. It was not empowered to suspend the execution of the judgment on the sentence. Thus, the case on which the inmate relied was inapplicable to situations such as the bond that was similar to one under Tenn. Code &sect; 12034 of the Workhouse Act which allowed re-arrest if a bond was not paid. Further, such provisions were not unconstitutional as violative of Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 18. Thus, the suspension of execution of the sentence by the city court under its authority was void and it had a right to have the inmate re-arrested and taken into custody to serve his sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant manufacturer sought review from a judgment of the Chancery Court of Shelby (Tennessee), which dismissed the case. The manufacturer sought a declaratory judgment on the applicability of the Fair Trade Act, 1937 Tenn. Pub. Acts 58, to the brands, trade names, or trademarks, of liquors sold when agreements pursuant to the Act had been executed and signed with third parties. Defendants were residents, citizens, and licensees of the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer, although it had no contracts with defendants, sought to have the courts restrict the licenses of defendants by enjoining them from selling liquor at a price contrary to terms of contract that the manufacturer had with third parties that were not parties to the suit. Defendants claimed that the Act was unconstitutional in that it violated Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 5580. Those provisions prohibited monopolies in Tennessee. The court found that the provisions of the Act applied only to commodities produced by the manufacturer bearing his trademark, brand, or name, and then only if they were in free competition with commodities of the same general class produced or distributed by others. The court concluded that the legality of the sale of liquor in Tennessee did not have anything to do with the application of the Act when it was properly construed.</SPAN></P>

The engineer answered. The Attorney General intervened, asserting that 1937 Tenn. Pub. Acts 175 was unconstitutional and praying that the engineer be served with process. Process was not served, but the case continued on its pleadings. The trial court held that the pleadings were insufficient to enter a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of ch. 175 and that the engineer's answer was sufficient to prevent the trial court from granting an injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed. Because no service of process was had upon the engineer with respect to the intervening petition, the engineer was not before the trial court on matters raised in the intervening petition, including the issue of the constitutionality of ch. 175. The Board admitted that, at the time the Board was created, the engineer was practicing engineering. He had a right to continue to practice under 1921 Tenn. Pub. Acts 167.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When plaintiff filed the action against the litigant, the declaration was not filed at the time the summons was issued, and the action was dismissed based on the failure to meet the procedural rules set forth in ch. 430. On appeal, the court rendered an opinion, and the litigant and county bar associations sought a rehearing. Upon rehearing, all justices concurred in the finding that the dismissal was improper, noting that a finding that the portion of ch. 430 subject to the appeal was unconstitutional would render the entire act unconstitutional. However, the court found that the private act conflicted with the general law set forth in Tenn. Code &sect; 8571, which provided that the suing out of a summons was the commencement of an action. Because the private act conflicted with the general law, the statute had priority and the claim was improperly dismissed. However, the court noted that the act was not unconstitutional because the legislature was authorized to create private rules for such terms of court and practice in the courts of the several counties, as it deemed requisite to meet local needs, and future litigants had no vested rights in reference to such procedural matters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cause of action concerned the allocation of school funds in Davidson County. It was argued that when the Private Act of 1929 was enacted, it was applicable only to Shelby County, Tennessee, but that because the population of Davidson County had increased, the Private Act of 1929 became applicable to Davidson County. The court held that the Private Act of 1929 was never intended to affect any county other than Shelby and that the statement as to population was immaterial. Thus, the Private Act of 1929 had no application to Davidson County. The court held that even though the Private Act of 1949, which had to do with the allocation of school money and the distribution of educational funds, affected Davidson County in its governmental capacity, it did not mean that the Act was valid. The court noted that the legislature could constitutionally enact a special act affecting one particular county so long as it was not contrary to the provisions of the general law, unless there was a reasonable basis for such discrimination. Because the Private Act of 1949 radically changed the allocation of school funds from the Tennessee General Education Bill of 1925, the law failed.</SPAN></P>

About 17 days later, plaintiff then filed her declaration, and about two weeks after the filing of the declaration, defendant filed a plea in abatement to the summons and the declaration.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of 1927 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 738, as amended by 1949 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 336 (Act). The county officials filed a demurrer, which was overruled by the trial court. The court reviewed the trial court's decision and concluded that the Act was unconstitutional. The court held that the bill was not signed by both houses. The House Journal failed to show that the bill as amended was ever passed by the state House of Representatives. Nor was there any showing upon the House Journal that the bill as amended was ever signed by the Speaker of the House in open session. Because it appeared that the bill was rejected, the journal entry so showing could not be disregarded, and the act was void. The court held that the citizen had authority to maintain the action because the Act dealt with the expense of holding primary elections and would have increased the citizen's tax burden.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the county judge contended that the amendatory statute in question was unconstitutional because the title failed to indicate the scope of the statute and was altogether misleading. The court held that: (1) the title was clearly misleading in that it expressly said that the amendment was for the purpose of providing that the sheriffs in all the counties of the state were to receive a minimum and maximum salary whereas the body of the statute limited its application to counties having certain populations; (2) the amendatory statute clearly undertook to suspend the general law; therefore, it was in violation of Tenn.

On appeal, the court determined that the purpose of art. 2, &sect; 31 was to prevent the State from using its credit as a gratuity or donation to any person, corporation, or municipality. It was not designed to prevent the State from using its credit to aid persons, corporations, or municipalities if required to accomplish a State or public purpose, or to fulfill a State duty or obligation under its police power. The State Hospital Act was valid and did not offend art. 2, &sect; 31 because (1) the Act was for the accomplishment of not only a public but a State purpose as well; (2) the hospitals became the agencies and instrumentalities of the State for the accomplishment of such State purposes under State control, regulation and supervision; (3) the objection that the sovereign had no title to the institutions was met by the proposition that it would continue to have the use of the hospitals for the benefit of the people of the entire State.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance, which limited the number of beer permits in the city, was a valid exercise of the police power by the municipality, and did not violate &sect; 22.

The taxpayers' action alleged that 1949 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 317, by which the Commission was created, was unconstitutional and void.

There was nothing in the body of the Act that was not congruous and germane to the stated purpose of the caption that was to reorganize the fiscal affairs and financial administration of the county. While the naming of the three members to an ad interim appointment on the new Commission was objectionable, it was possible to elide this objectionable section of the Act and not invalidate the entire Act.

It had arrangements with medical doctors in each of its stores who occupied a small space inside each store. The doctors worked during store hours at the respective stores, examined the eyes of customers directed to them by defendant's employees, were guaranteed a fixed minimum weekly income by defendant, and paid no rent. The state charged defendant with unauthorizedly engaging in the practice of optometry. The trial court found that defendant had violated the Optometry Act (act). On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's opinion and remanded the case. The court found that the doctors were employees of defendant and that defendant violated the Optometry Act. The court found that the profession of the optometrist and the sale of merchandise by the optician was a single operation and enterprise. The court also held that the question of the unconstitutionality of a 1935 amendment to the act was immaterial and irrelevant to the controversy before it, and that the provisions of the act were a proper exercise of the legislature's police power and sound public policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the Tennessee Secretary of State, filed suit against appellants, the Attorney General and the Comptroller of the State of Tennessee (state officials), and the members of the Davidson County Election Commission. He sought an order declaring that 1949 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 49 was constitutional. After the Davidson County Chancery Court (Tennessee) refused to find the matter nonjusticiable and upheld the Act, appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state officials challenged the ruling below on the issue of justiciability and the identification of proper parties under the Declaratory Judgment Law, Tenn.

The court affirmed the lower court order in all respects. It rejected the state officials' challenge to justiciability of the claim under &sect; 8835 et seq., finding that the Secretary had a real interest in the constitutionality of the Act because it compelled him to expend state funds in order to hold a special election, the propriety of which was at issue. The court held that both the Secretary and the state officials were proper parties and that the chancery court did not err in exercising jurisdiction. It also affirmed a ruling that the Act was constitutional, ruling that the state constitution did not prohibit the legislature from submitting to a popular vote the question of whether a constitutional convention with restricted powers should be convened and that the power of voters to approve such convention existed unless forbidden by the state constitution, which it was not.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Act, which provided for the sale of intoxicating liquors bearing a federal tax stamp that had been seized in dry territory by officers of the law, was constitutional. There was nothing in the state constitution that placed any limitation upon the legislature in the enactment of laws to prohibit or regulate the sale, possession, and transportation of intoxicating liquors.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners resided in the main dwelling, and the rear building was occupied by renters, who were not employed by the property owners.

As a result, the city ordered the renters to vacate the building. The property owners argued that the ordinance was an unreasonable and arbitrary interference with their rights, amounting to a taking of property without due process of law, contrary to the U.S. and Tennessee Constitutions. On review, the court upheld the ordinance and the city's actions in reliance on it. The court held that the zoning ordinance represented a valid exercise of the police power of the city in seeking to limit the occupancy of a specific area, while also carving out an exception for servants to occupy such a rear building. The court found that the exception for such accessory use of a rear building for a servant for a single family was valid, even if renters were not permitted to occupy such a building under the zoning requirements.</SPAN></P>

The taxes did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment because they did not result in arbitrary and palpably disproportionate allocation to Tennessee of income actually earned in another state.

A chancery court determined that the sheriff was entitled to the compensation. The county appealed, and court of appeals affirmed. The county then filed a petition for writ of certiorari. The writ was denied because a judge of the general sessions court was entitled to the protection of the executive branch of the county in the conduct of his court, as contemplated by Tenn. Code &sect; 696(2) and Tenn. Code &sect; 10707.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county judge sought supersedeas and a writ of error regarding two judgments of the Chancery Court of Anderson County (Tennessee), which granted appellee sheriff's requests for peremptory writs of mandamus for payment of certain expenses and salary that were claimed due under 1947 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 156, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff's first action sought the sum of $ 242.73, which was the amount by which his expenses and salary exceeded the collected fees of his office for one month. This suit also averred that the county held $ 126.24 by reason of an admitted unconstitutional act. The second suit claimed that the sheriff was owed four months of salary for a period during which he had been unlawfully ousted from office. The primary question was whether 1947 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 156, &sect; 2 was applicable to the county. This section of the Act attempted to amend Tenn. Code &sect; 10743, which provided that the salaries of county officers were limited to the fees actually collected by said officers. The amendment exempted sheriffs from such limitation on their salaries and provided that any excess amount was to be paid from the public funds. The court held that such amendment applied only to certain size counties, which did not include the county in question. Accordingly, the writ that awarded mandamus in the amount of $ 242.73 was erroneous. However, the writ as to the $ 126.24, which was awarded by reason of the unconstitutional act, was correct. Also, the writ regarding the unpaid salary was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the writ, which awarded the amount held by the county as a result of an admitted unconstitutional act. The court reversed the writs that awarded the sums otherwise claimed by the sheriff.</SPAN></P>

Appellants argued that the Act, both in its caption and body, clearly contained two separate and distinct subjects in the law. The chancery court upheld the Act because plurality of a title was not an objection when the several plural provisions dealt with, and by necessary construction were not, constituent parts of one subject.

That section prohibited the city from issuing a certificate to any cab company, except one entitled to a grandfather certificate, until after a public hearing, a finding of additional need, and 60 days to allow established cab companies to provide needed services.

The court also rejected the Board of Commissioners' contention that it was vested with the authority to audit the accounts. Under the general law, the sheriff was entitled to be paid after his sworn statement of itemized accounts had been certified as correct by the district attorney and the circuit judge and audited by the county judge. There was no reason that the sheriff would have to comply with an additional audit requirement. The court affirmed the Chancellor's decree except with regard to transportation and guarding bills that were not approved, finding that the duty of the Board of Commissioners to issue the county's warrant was a ministerial duty, not a discretionary duty, that it was obligated to perform when the sheriff's accounts were properly certified and approved.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the Chancellor's ruling that the Traffic Commission was an administrative agency under the act and that the regulation complained of was clearly within the authority conferred upon it. The court rejected the complainant's contention that the act was an unlawful delegation of legislative power because the word &quot;legislative&quot; lent no force and effect to the authority given to the Traffic Commission. It was merely an administrative agency authorized to exercise a distinct administrative power of the city to regulate traffic. The regulation making the street one-way was not invalid for want of notice to the complainant because notice was not a prerequisite to the exercise of the police power by the city or the Traffic Commission in case of emergency.</SPAN></P>

Priv. Acts ch. 773, &sect; 2 was unconstitutional because its requirement of a high school diploma or its equivalent for members of the county's board of education was quite different from the requirement of a practical education under Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed from the Chancery Court of Gibson County (Tennessee) decree in favor of defendant school district in the taxpayer's declaratory judgment action seeking a decree as to the validity of 1925 Tenn. Priv. Acts 467,, which purported to repeal the school district. The chancellor held inter alia that it was unconstitutional and that it had not repealed 1917 Tenn. Priv. Acts 153 as claimed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1917 the state legislature created a special school district, defendant school district herein, by 1917 Tenn. Priv. Acts 153 (1917 Act). In 1925 the legislature enacted 1925 Tenn. Priv. Acts 467 (1925 Act), which purported to repeal the 1917 Act. At the same session the general school law applicable to the entire state was enacted. In 1929 the legislature enacted 1929 Tenn. Priv. Acts 78, which amended the 1917 Act. Nearly 20 years later, the taxpayer sued to have the 1925 Act declared valid. The school district answered and denied that the 1925 Act was valid or had repealed the 1917 Act. The lower court agreed, holding that the 1925 Act was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. The 1925 Act was contrary to Tenn. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17, as it failed to state what it purported to repeal, and also violated Tenn. Const. art. 11, &sect; 8. In addition, the 1925 Act was repealed by 1929 Tenn. Priv. Acts 78, which revived the 1917 Act, which was further amended by 1947 Tenn. Priv. Acts 707. Finally, several provisions of the 1925 Act conflicted with the state's general school law. It was clear that when the general school law was passed in 1925, the challenged act was thereafter a nullity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chancellor's decree was affirmed. The court agreed that the challenged act was unconstitutional, that it had not repealed anything, and that it violated the state constitution by not reciting the title or substance of the law sought to be repealed.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 8196.1 was the statute in effect at the time the administration of the decedent's estate commenced and therefore, it timely filed its claim within the one year period required under the original statute. The trial court rendered a judgment in the creditor's favor and the administratrix appealed. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the trial court correctly applied the original statute because there was nothing in the amendment to indicate an intention on the part of the legislature that it was to be applied retroactively. The court concluded that the county court was vested with jurisdiction to hear matter in probate and therefore, there was no doubt that it had jurisdiction to approve or disapprove claims against a decedent's estate.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court judgment because it found that 1947 Tenn. Priv.

Acts ch. 671 allowed the issues of bonds for the building of the courthouse without voter approval from the people of the county, it violated Tenn. Const. art. 11, &sect; 8. The court found that if the offending portion was excised from the act, the balance was constitutional. The court determined that requiring the county to pay attorney fees was proper because the question of the validity of the acts was very important for determination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant union sought review of an order of the Chancery Court of Shelby County (Tennessee), which granted the injunction sought by complainant produce wholesalers. The injunction sought to prevent the illegal calling of a strike. At issue was whether the Tennessee Open Shop Law, 1947 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 36, violated the due process of law clauses contained in the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union operated as a closed shop. Following the enactment of the Act, the parties' labor contract came up for renewal. The wholesalers wanted the contract to provide that if the Act was held unconstitutional, then closed shop and check-off provisions of the contract would be reinstated, but in the meantime they were not part of the contract. The union disagreed. On appeal, the court found that the Act was constitutional. It did not discriminate against union members in favor of nonunion members because each group was given the same protection and the same right. It did not violate the restraints placed on the state's use of its police power by the Fourteenth Amendment. Although the Act in effect allowed nonunion members to obtain the benefit of union activity without being required to contribute the support and maintenance of the union, that objection was for the legislature, not the court. Because the Act provided that no person could be denied employment because of membership or non-membership in a labor union, it did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Act did not interfere with the right to form a union, or to bargain collectively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The retailer demanded that the consumer pay the tax under the statute. After paying the tax under protest, the consumer initiated an action to recover the tax paid alleging that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court sustained the State's demurrer. In affirming the decision, the court found that the Retail Sales Tax statute was constitutional. The tax was a privilege tax and not a property or ad valorem tax. The court found that the privilege tax was levied upon the retailer, rather than the consumer. The court held that the State in the exercise of its sovereign power could impose a privilege tax upon any and all business transactions to the end that the general public be protected from unfair trade practices. The tax statute did not violate Tenn. Const. art. 2, &sect; 28 because the rate of taxation was fair and the same to one and all alike. The tax statute did not violate Tenn. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17 because the body of the statute was not broader than its caption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Town residents filed a formal complaint before the Railroad &amp; Public Utilities Commission contending that the railway company's spur track was a nuisance, that it was detrimental to the public health in that there were no toilet facilities for employees, and was a hazard for the traveling public. The track was built in close proximity to a residential section and it was used for loading and unloading wagons without having to drive to the company's terminals. The Commission ordered the abandonment by the company of the track and required it to be located elsewhere. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment sustaining the company's petition and affirmed the judgment voiding the order of the Commission. The court concluded that Tenn. Code &sect;&sect; 5449 and 5450 and 1939 Tenn. Pub. Acts 130 did not give the Commission authority to order the company to abandon its property and seek to locate its railroad facility in some other place.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An act that imposed a tax on admission tickets to any place of amusement applied only to Knox County on a population classification. Complainants, who were required to collect the tax, argued that the act was unconstitutional because it taxed the privilege to attend a place of amusement. The lower court sustained the constitutionality of the act, and the court affirmed. The court held that the legislature had unlimited power to tax privileges and could exercise that power in any manner in its discretion. The tax did not violate equal protection provisions because the act primarily affected the county in its governmental or political capacity. If an act affected citizens of a particular county in their individual status, then the classification had to rest on a reasonable basis. However, if an act affected a county as a governmental agency, it was acceptable. Because the primary purpose of the act was to raise revenue for the county, the tax was a governmental function.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer claimed that it was entitled to amortize any premium that it paid for a bond and thus decrease its tax liability. The tax commissioner contended that the Hall Income Tax Law, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 1123(1) et seq., levied the tax upon the gross interest returns from bonds rather than upon the net interest returns to the trustee. The trial court dismissed the taxpayer's bill, and the court affirmed. The court found that the legislative intent in enacting the law was to provide for the assessment of taxes upon property that paid no ad valorem tax. The fact that the taxpayer paid a premium for the bond did not authorize it to deduct a portion of the interest for the purpose of amortizing the bond and thereby pay a tax upon net income. There was no suggestion in the law that a taxpayer could deduct anything from the annual interest. The court held that a construction which would operate to impair, frustrate, or defeat the object of the statute should be avoided.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court rejected defendant's arguments and affirmed his conviction. It held that evidence of defendant's erratic driving justified the investigatory stop of his vehicle. It further held that the evidence supported the verdict rendered by the jury, that defendant's prior conviction could not be collaterally attacked, and that the chemical test form was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Regardless, the court held the statute was not unconstitutionally vague since a vacant house was clearly included within the statutory definition of &quot;habitation.&quot; Since the court previously determined that it was not error for the trial court to refuse to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of burglary, defendant could not raise the issue again in a post-conviction proceeding.</SPAN></P>

In his second scheme, defendant attempted to purchase the Certified Fire Inspector Examination by using an established friendship with an employee of the Tennessee Fire Marshall's Office. On appeal, court rejected defendant's many challenges to his conviction. During the course of scheme one, defendant alleged that he cooperated with investigators. He asserted that he was entitled to protection of the public duty defense. Court disagreed because defendant bestowed pecuniary benefit on Board's employee prior to his alleged cooperation with investigators.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to eight counts of aggravated rape of his minor daughter, for which the trial court imposed four concurrent and four consecutive 25-year sentences.

The court affirmed. Although it noted that the sentences for certain of defendant's past criminal acts should have been calculated under each of two state sentencing statutes, and the lesser of the two sentences imposed, there was no ex post facto violation and failure to do so was harmless error. The trial court correctly applied sentencing enhancement factors, and made no error in imposing consecutive sentencing, because that decision followed established precedent and was within the discretion of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged as of right from order of Montgomery County Circuit Court (Tennessee), which dismissed an indictment charging appellee with knowingly possessing gambling devices in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-505 and finding portions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-17-501, 39-17-505&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The overbreadth doctrine did not apply to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-17-501, 39-17-505 because possession of a gambling device enjoyed no protection under U.S. Const. amend. I, nor did possession implicate another constitutionally protected right. The definition of a gambling device was not vague on its face because under the statute, whether a device was a gambling device by design turned upon whether the device was principally designed for use in gambling based upon the objective features that the manufacturer incorporated into the device. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-501(3) was not vague as applied because appellee had fair notice that her video machines constituted gambling devices. The statutory exception for lawful business transactions did not violate appellee's equal protection rights because the legislature's distinction between lawful transactions and activities that constitute gambling was rationally related to the state's legitimate interests in prohibiting gambling and regulating business to preserve public morals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed and remanded for reinstatement of the indictment because the statute was not vague on its face or as applied, the overbreadth doctrine did not apply, and the statutory exception for lawful business transactions did not violate appellee's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded there was no rational basis for the special exception for Davidson County, Tennessee, to the general DUI statute and that the suspect provision violated constitutional equal protection requirements. The State appealed. The court found it was precluded from ruling on the instant question because (1) the issue raised by the State was moot and (2) the case was absent adverse parties. The trial court's pronouncement finding &sect; 55-10-403(n)&nbsp;unconstitutional had no effect on the State or the appellee. Accordingly, the court's ruling was adverse to neither party.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the motion finding the court below correctly concluded that petitioner's claim for relief was time-barred. Because petitioner failed to fit within one of the tolling exceptions set forth in Tenn.

Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-432. Defendant pled guilty and his sentence was enhanced. In his plea agreement, defendant reserved the right to appeal the School Zone Act's constitutionality. The court answered that the School Zone Act was not unconstitutionally vague because enhancement statutes do not require mens rea language. Even if the School Zone Act were a separate offense statute, it would require a showing of recklessness under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-11-301(c), so was not unconstitutionally vague. Any difficulty inherent in measuring distance from school property to avoid the enhancement was not a due process violation. The School Zone Act's goal, compared with the Drug Control Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-401, et seq., was not unconstitutionally redundant. Defendant's sentence was not grossly disproportionate so did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII.</SPAN></P>

In his direct appeal as of right, defendant raised several issues, including whether the evidence of premeditation was sufficient to support his first-degree murder conviction and whether the evidence was sufficient to support the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance. The court affirmed both the conviction and the sentence, holding, inter alia, that the proof offered at trial supported a finding that defendant had acted with premeditation at the time of the killing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a prison inmate serving a life sentence, filed a document styled &quot;petition for disbarment,&quot; urging that his attorney be disbarred for providing ineffective assistance of counsel in appellant's unsuccessful post-conviction proceeding. The trial judge treated the petition as one for post-conviction relief and dismissed it, primarily because it was time-barred. On appeal, the court held the trial court did not err in treating the pleading as a petition for post-conviction relief, because it raised issues typically raised in post-conviction proceedings. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 23-3-202, which provided a procedure for attorney disbarment, did not require a judge to commence disbarment proceedings based on appellant's allegations of ineffective assistance, where such claims were intertwined with various other claims alleging judicial error. Appellant was free to file a disciplinary action under Rule 9 of the Tennessee Supreme Court rules. The court affirmed the dismissal of appellant's petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of one count of aggravated burglary, aggravated rape, and harassment, and two counts of attempted rape. He subsequently filed a petition for post-conviction relief that was denied by the trial court. Affirming the denial, the appellate court concluded that the trial court did not err in not granting the petition although the state failed to respond to the petition and failed to make certain transcripts a part of the post-conviction record. The trial court also did not err in refusing to allow petitioner to call a prosecutor as a witness at the post-conviction hearing to prove petitioner's claim of prosecutorial vindictiveness. Furthermore, petitioner's convictions for two counts of attempted rape and one count of aggravated rape were not precluded by the double jeopardy clause. Moreover, the indictment that charged petitioner was legally sufficient and not fatally deficient for failing to allege the mens rea for the offenses charged. Petitioner was also not denied the effective assistance of counsel at his trial and his appeal. Finally, the trial court's reasonable doubt jury instruction, containing the phrase &quot;moral certainty,&quot; was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's denial of post-conviction relief for petitioner, rejecting all of his contentions, including his contentions that the trial court erred in denying his petition for post-conviction relief due to the state's failure to respond to the allegations in the petition, and his contention that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at his trial and his appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of accessory before the fact to first-degree murder for soliciting another to kill appellant's husband. In a separate sentence hearing, appellant was sentenced to death by electrocution. The appellate court affirmed denial of appellant's petition for post-conviction relief and ordered that appellant's death sentence be carried out unless stayed by an appropriate order. The appellate court held that appellant failed to show that counsel's performance was deficient and that it prejudiced appellant as required to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. Additionally, appellant failed to overcome the presumption that counsel's conduct fell within a range of reasonable professional assistance. Furthermore, the appellate court held that the trial court did not diminish the overall fairness of the proceeding. Although appellant waived the issue of vicarious application of aggravating circumstances under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(i)(5), the court stated that appellant was death eligible and that aggravating circumstances were supported by proof. Appellant's constitutionality challenge to the death penalty was rejected.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted the sheriff and his deputies, as interested parties, could not participate in the jury selection process without infringing upon defendant's due process rights. The court of appeals held there was no indication from the record that the bystander jury procedures were applied unconstitutionally. Although at the post-conviction hearing defendant stated the deputy who selected the two potential jurors was involved in the investigation of his case, defendant provided no evidence other than his own testimony. The record showed the deputy did not testify at trial, contradicting defendant's assertion of the deputy's importance to the case against him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief with the trial court after the conviction and sentence had been affirmed by the state's highest court. The trial court denied defendant post-conviction relief. The trial court's denial of post-conviction relief was affirmed on appeal because all eight issues presented by defendant for review were found to be without merit. In reference to some of those issues, the court found that defendant's post-conviction due process rights had not been violated because his counsel had adequate preparation time and because the trial court's denial of requested investigatory and expert services was proper. The court also found that evidence suppressed by the prosecution that was favorable to defendant was not material because other evidence of guilt was overwhelming. Furthermore, testimony by a juror as to information communicated by the foreperson was properly excluded because the information constituted only an internal influence. Finally, the court below properly concluded that defendant had received effective assistance of counsel at trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal by the supreme court. Defendant filed for post-conviction relief, which was denied.

The court remanded the case for a new sentencing hearing because there was an erroneous application of the felony murder aggravator, and the state improperly withheld material, exculpatory evidence relating to the penalty phase of the trial. However, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in all other respects. In reaching its decision on improperly withheld evidence, the court determined that the prosecution suppressed a crime scene report favorable to defendant, which was material because there was a reasonable probability that the results of the proceedings would have been different.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected defendant's argument that the child abuse and neglect statutes were unconstitutionally vague. The court noted that the evidence showed defendant inflicted injury on a two-year-old and that under Tenn.

Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-601 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was declared a motor vehicle habitual offender pursuant to the Motor Vehicle Habitual Offenders Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-601 et seq. Appellant argued that he was denied a hearing on material disputed issues of fact as required by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-610, and due to insufficient service of process, the trial court never obtained jurisdiction over his person and the state's petition was barred as the statute of limitations for declaring him an habitual traffic offender had expired. The court ruled that there was no disputed issue of fact, and that the only determination was a question of law; that is, whether appellant had the requisite number of convictions within the requisite time period. Further, the court held that there was no dispute regarding the facts of the case, and appellant had no right to trial by jury under the state constitution. Also, the court found that appellant's failure to raise the service of process and lack of jurisdiction defenses at trial amounted to waiver of these issues. The court affirmed the order declaring appellant a motor vehicle habitual offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order declaring appellant a motor vehicle habitual offender was affirmed where there was no statutory or constitutional abridgement of appellant's rights under the Motor Vehicle Habitual Offender's Act, appellant was provided both notice and an opportunity to be heard, and there was no factual dispute that appellant was convicted of three enumerated offenses within the statutorily defined period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence from the Jefferson County Criminal Court (Tennessee), on charge of vehicular homicide by intoxication. Appellant challenged the 10-year sentence as well as the admission of blood test evidence, expert testimony, and physical evidence found in his car.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was involved in a collision with another car which killed a passenger in the other car. Appellant was convicted of vehicular homicide in a jury trial where appellant's intoxication was the only disputed issue. Appellant challenged the admission of certain evidence and his sentence. The court affirmed both the conviction and the sentence, saying that the only error was harmless. The trial court admitted hospital records containing blood test results as proof of intoxication. The court said this evidence was relevant because it related to appellant's intoxication -- the only disputed issue at trial. The records were not properly authenticated where they were admitted without testimony of the custodian. However, the court found that the error was harmless because the evidence was merely cumulative of other evidence and the records were deemed reliable because they were contemporaneously made and regularly kept business records were not prepared for litigation. A medical expert was entitled to rely on the records as hearsay evidence as the basis for his opinion because they were the types of records normally relied upon by an expert.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction because the trial court admitted medical records under a firmly established exception to the hearsay rule and the admission of such records did not violate appellant's confrontation right because the records were merely cumulative of other evidence and were deemed reliable. The enhancement of the minimum sentence was appropriate because there were aggravating factors and no mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed as of right from the summary dismissal of his pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Defendant alleged that he was serving an effective 120-year sentence for five armed robbery convictions. Defendant contended that sentencing him under the 1982 Criminal Sentencing Reform Act resulted in enhanced sentences and was in violation of the ex post facto law. The appellate court held that the issue of enhancement or excessive sentence did not support a claim for habeas corpus relief. Because defendant's petition failed to establish that his convictions were void or that his sentences had expired, the issue was without merit. As for the jury instruction, no authenticated reasonable doubt jury instruction was included within the record. Moreover, challenges to a jury instruction are not cognizable within the context of a state habeas corpus proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state prisoner was granted post-conviction relief from his death sentence but not from his first-degree murder conviction. On appeal, both decisions were affirmed. The court held that, as to sentencing, trial counsels' failure to investigate, present evidence on, and argue as mitigation petitioner's mental deficiencies constituted prejudicially deficient representation. The court held that had such evidence been presented, there was a reasonable probability that the jurors would have voted to spare petitioner's life. As to petitioner's conviction, however, there was no basis for collateral relief. Petitioner's objection to the trial judge's declaration that he was competent had already been addressed on direct appeal, while his claims of denial of a fair trial due to improper withdrawal of his medication by correctional officials and torture by prison guards were not raised in the post-conviction petition and were thus waived. Petitioner's vague, cumulative constitutional violation claims were not cognizable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was found guilty of one count of larceny and one count of receiving stolen property.

After a second mistrial, the jury returned a guilty verdict for habitual criminal, and petitioner received a sentence of life imprisonment. Petitioner sought post-conviction relief, which was denied. Petitioner appealed the adverse decision, raising several issues including whether his conviction for habitual offender violated the doctrine of collateral estoppel. The court affirmed judgment denying post-conviction relief, because the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not apply since the record on the first habitual criminal trial was deficient and the jury's acquittal of petitioner on the charge of habitual criminality did not collaterally estop the state from prosecuting a second habitual criminal charge, if the state relied upon the exact same prior convictions in both proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, after conviction and sentencing on six counts of being a habitual criminal, filed a petition for post-conviction relief which was denied.

On review, the court found appellant's allegation that he was a victim of judicial vindictiveness by imposition of the consecutive sentences was moot because appellant had waived this claim by failing to raise this issue in his first appeal. Appellant was also not entitled to relief on the merits of this claim because different judges presided over the original sentencing hearing and the resentencing hearing, and any risk of vindictiveness by the trial judge being confronted by resentencing was nonexistent.

After the conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, petitioner sought post-conviction relief pursuant to the Post-Conviction Procedure Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-112 (1990). The lower court denied relief, saying that the issues raised had been previously determined by the trial court and on direct appeal. Petitioner appealed and the court affirmed the denial of post-conviction relief. Petitioner raised a variety of claims, generally alleging that his trial or appellate counsel had been ineffective. To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, petitioner was required to prove that counsel's performance was below the range of competence demanded of attorneys and a reasonable probability that but for counsel's error, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Counsel was not ineffective because he failed to raise claims that had been rejected by the courts. Ineffective assistance of counsel was not proven by failure to permit petitioner to testify where he could have been impeached with three prior murder convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following convictions of rape and habitual criminality and entry of a sentence for life imprisonment, petitioner criminal defendant filed numerous petitions for post-conviction and habeas corpus relief. In response to a petition for habeas corpus relief, lower court summarily dismissed the proceedings on the basis that petitioner failed to state a cognizable ground for relief. The reviewing court affirmed, holding that petitioner's only cognizable ground for relief was without merit. The court explained that the remedy of the writ of habeas corpus was limited to relief from void judgments, but that such relief was an inappropriate procedure for review of potential errors of the trial court. Although petitioner's constitutional challenge to the habitual criminal statutes was cognizable, the claim was without merit. The court rejected petitioner's argument that burglary of an automobile did not constitute burglary within the meaning of the infamy statute, which was incorporated into the habitual criminal statutes, explaining that petitioner was provided with adequate notice of the predicate offense of burglary where the meaning was previously clarified by judicial interpretations.</SPAN></P>

The court held petitioner's indictments were not void for failure to allege a culpable mental state for offenses of armed robbery and first-degree murder. At time of petitioner's crimes, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-202 (1982), under which petitioner was charged with first-degree murder, and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-13-202 (1982), charging petitioner with robbery, did not contain a defined culpable mental state for the commission of each offense. Petitioner's indictments followed the statutory form of the crimes and the culpable mental states required were sufficiently alleged. Court held that although Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-13-103 required district attorney sign each charging document, it was not essential that he sign each count of petitioner's murder indictment. The court held indictment pertaining to first-degree murder did not subject petitioner to double jeopardy because two counts in the indictment were alternative means of committing the same offense.

Petitioner filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief, which was denied.

The trial court held that petitioner was denied an appeal on the first petition, due to the inaction of appointed counsel, but that the state could charge under either robbery statute. Petitioner appealed the trial court's ruling. The appeals court affirmed. The court agreed that petitioner was deprived of an appeal on the merits of the first petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted for first degree murder of his wife. The prosecutor presented evidence of prior acts of sexual misconduct between the defendant and his minor daughter.

The defendant argued that the trial court erred by permitting the state to present prior acts of the sexual misconduct, by the judge's consideration of the victim impact statements, and by imposing a sentence that was excessive. The court determined that the probative value of the sexual misconduct was not outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice. The prior bad acts evidence supplied a motive and intent for the murder. The court further found that the consideration of the victim impact statement did not violate the Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution, but there may have been some statements that were erroneously admitted. However, after conducting a de novo review, in which the erroneously admitted statement were not considered, the court found that sentence imposed was not excessive.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed the trial court's denial of his petition for post-conviction relief of his aggravated burglary and theft convictions. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that petitioner failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence any factual allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel that would entitle him to relief. There was no constitutional requirement that an attorney argue every issue on appeal, and attorney's testimony demonstrated that decision not to appeal the issues in questions, was a tactical decision that would not be second-guessed by the court. Although prosecutor's statement was misleading, the trial court instructed the jury that the petitioner still carried the presumption of innocence, and petitioner did not show the statement was prejudicial to the outcome of the trial. The court also held that the other allegations of improper arguments or statements by the prosecutor, and error in the indictment were without merit, because the indictment tracked the wording of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of the first-degree murder of his wife. As a result, defendant was sentenced to life in prison. Defendant contended that the evidence of premeditation and deliberation was insufficient to support the verdict. He also asserted that the trial court erred in allowing the state to cross-examine defense witnesses about defendant's prior violent acts against the victim and erred in instructing the jury about the range of punishment for the various degrees of homicide. The court found that defendant had not carried his appellate burden and that, in the light most favorable to the state, the evidence provided bases upon which the jury could infer that defendant deliberated by weighing the wisdom and consequences of the homicide that he clearly intended. Also, the court found that prior threats made by defendant were admissible to show premeditation, intent, or his state of mind. Finally, defendant failed to establish that any constitutional principles invalidated the procedures used in instructing the jury about the range of punishment for the various degrees of homicide.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried on indictments charging him with, inter alia, premeditated murder under Tenn.

The jury found him guilty of both offenses, but the trial court merged them into one judgment and one life sentence for first degree murder. Defendant appealed the verdict. In affirming, the court ruled, inter alia, that sufficient evidence was presented that would permit the jury to conclude that defendant bound the victim with tape in his own home and choked him to death. The prosecution was not required to elect one theory, premeditated murder or felony murder, and could proceed on both theories because they were alternative means of committing first degree murder. The merger of the verdict into one judgment of conviction was not improper. There was no abuse of discretion in the denial of a continuance and a mistrial, and jury instructions cured references to inadmissible polygraph testimony. Also, allowing defense character witnesses to be questioned about a prior assault by defendant and the prosecution's closing argument were not improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the robbery of a woman, in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-401(a). Following presentation of the evidence, the jury was instructed as to the offenses of robbery, attempted robbery, and theft of property, but defendant's request for an instruction on attempted theft was denied. A truth-in-sentencing instruction was also given with respect to the range of possible sentences of imprisonment. Defendant was convicted of robbery and a sentence was imposed that was consecutive to that imposed in a prior unrelated case. Defendant appealed the ruling. In affirming, the court ruled that, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence supported the conviction. The denial of the attempted theft instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the guilty verdict for robbery in the face of instructions for other lesser offenses necessarily rejected all other lesser offenses. The truth-in-sentencing instruction was also harmless error because it did not appear to have affected the result. Given defendant's criminal record, imposing a consecutive sentence rather than a concurrent one was appropriate under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-115.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction and sentence were affirmed because the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, supported the verdict, and the failure to give a jury instruction on the lesser included offense of attempted theft and the giving of a truth-in-sentencing instruction were harmless error.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Petitioner's conviction was affirmed on appeal. Petitioner filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief alleging that he was ineffectively assisted by counsel when a suppression issue was not adjudicated on direct appeal. The court below found the petition barred by the statute of limitations. The court found that petitioner filed his post-conviction petition well past the statute of limitations period in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-201. Petitioner contended that the statute of limitations should not bar his petition because the basis of his claims were &quot;later-arising&quot; facts under a particular case. The court found that petitioner could not meet the applicable test because petitioner was aware much earlier than he claimed of appellate counsel's inability to obtain a transcript or order containing the trial court's findings of facts and conclusions of law on the suppression issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of their convictions by the Shelby County Criminal Court (Tennessee) for burglary of a building and theft of property, in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-14-403 and 39-14-103. Appellants claimed the trial court improperly denied motions for severance and to suppress evidence. Appellant who was sentenced as career offender also argued that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were stopped after police officers spotted a car driving without headlights. When the driver could not produce a driver's license he was arrested. The officers noticed a clear plastic bag containing seven miniature televisions with price tags attached. A further search of the trunk revealed more stolen items. Both appellants were then arrested and charged with burglary of a building and two counts of theft of property. Appellants were convicted and appealed; the convictions were affirmed on appeal. The court held that the trial court's denial of appellants' motion to sever was not an abuse of discretion because appellants did not demonstrate they were prejudiced by the denial. The appellant who was a passenger in the car had no expectation of privacy, thus he had no standing to object to a search of the car. The court also ruled that appellants' motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of an investigatory stop was properly denied by the trial court, because the officers acted reasonably under the circumstances. In addition, the search of the trunk area was supported by probable cause and exigent circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and sentences for burglary and theft of property. The court held that appellants failed to demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the denial of the motion for severance. Court also held that co-defendant passenger of vehicle did not have standing to object to the search and seizure, as he had no expectation of privacy. Motion to suppress was properly denied as search was incident to a lawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic. Defendant was charged with second-degree murder after he shot his father while his father sat on the living room couch. Affirming the criminal court's conviction, the appeal court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction of second-degree murder. The court explained that defendant had armed himself and approached his father, who was sitting on the living room couch. Defendant then fired the shotgun at the couch, broke down the weapon, discharged the spent shell, and reloaded the weapon. Even though the victim pled for his life, defendant shot at him again. The court also found that the criminal court had not erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress his custodial statement of confession. The weight of the evidence supported the conclusion that defendant's waiver was knowing and voluntary and that he was not so mentally unsound as to render the confession inadmissible. Denial of the motion to suppress was proper. Finally, the court held Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-11-501, the statute governing insanity was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, petitioner appealed and contended that the indictment was fatally defective due to the omission of the requisite mental state for aggravated rape. The court held that petitioner's indictment satisfied the three-part test of Hill for an indictment that failed to allege a mental state. Petitioner further contended that the jury instruction was unconstitutional due to the omission of the requisite mental state. The court held that post-conviction relief was not available because this issue had been waived because it was not raised at trial or on direct appeal. The trial court's instruction to the jury on aggravated rape in fact omitted the requisite mens rea or mental element of intent, knowledge, or recklessness. Thus, the trial court's omission constituted error. However, the court concluded that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

Defendant asserted that he was denied liberty without due process as a result of deficiencies in the customary arrest and bail procedures and that the trial court erred by enhancing the conviction due to two prior DUI convictions that defendant argued were facially invalid. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. First, defendant's asserted violations of due process did not result in any prejudice; for example, defendant made bond approximately six hours after he was booked and produced no evidence during that time that was later used against him. Consequently, defendant was not entitled to appellate relief on due process grounds. Second, because nothing on the face of the records disclosed any invalidity to his prior guilty-plea convictions for DUI, defendant had no right to attack the validity of the prior convictions to prevent an enhancement to his current sentence for third-offense DUI. In fact, defendant signed waivers of indictment and trial by jury with respect to the prior convictions. Moreover, defendant was represented by counsel at both proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-101 et seq., applied because defendant's petition was filed before May 10, 1995, the court affirmed because defendant failed to prove that the evidence in the record preponderated against the trial court's findings, which complied with the procedural requirements of &sect; 40-30-118(b). With respect to defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, defendant failed to prove that performance by defense counsel was deficient and that the deficient performance resulted in prejudice to defendant so as to deprive him of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the applicable state law, the court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of defendant's petition for post-conviction relief, which followed defendant's conviction on three counts of felony murder and the imposition of a death sentence that was affirmed on direct appeal. The evidentiary record did not preponderate against the trial court's findings, and defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Convictions of defendant mother for aggravated child abuse in the deaths of her two infants were affirmed. Defendant testified she did not see any danger in leaving her infants strapped in their child seats in her locked car for over nine hours. Defendant's statements to officers while in a hospital waiting room were not obtained in violation of her Miranda rights because she was not in custody. Her blood sample indicating a high blood alcohol content also was given voluntarily. A search of her car two days later with no warrant that turned up a whiskey bottle was permissible. Her voluntary statements provided probable cause to believe there was evidence in the car subject to seizure. Child abuse and neglect, defined by statute as a lesser-included offense of first-degree murder, necessarily was included within aggravated child abuse, and aggravated abuse thus also was a lesser-included offense of first-degree murder that defendant was charged with, but acquitted. An instruction on aggravated abuse that did not define intent as to each element of the offense was harmless error because a detailed instruction on the word knowingly increased the prosecution's burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

Because every state in the country had prohibitions against incest, the prohibition spanned far into history in every culture the court reviewed, and the prohibition was a deeply rooted tradition, there was clearly no fundamental right to perform the act. As there was no fundamental right involved, rationality review applied to the prohibition. The court held that the prohibition passed rationality review. The state had a legitimate interest in protecting the integrity of the family and in promoting domestic peace and purity, and it was objectively related to prohibiting sexual relations between those related within the proscribed degrees of kinship. The prohibition was constitutional; therefore, there was no error in dismissing the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for rape of a child, his daughter. The victim testified that her father performed cunnilingus on her when she was approximately 11 and one-half years old. She further testified that defendant never penetrated her sexually and that she was still a virgin. Defendant admitted to the police that he kissed and licked his daughter's genitals. On appeal, defendant's initial challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence was that he was convicted of rape without any evidence of penetration. The court reasoned that pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-522, rape of a child required sexual penetration and penetration included cunnilingus. The court concluded that there was more than sufficient evidence that defendant committed rape of a child as defined by statute. The court rejected defendant's challenges to the admissibility of evidence and jury instructions. With respect to defendant's sentencing appeal, the court found that the trial court properly applied enhancement factors. However, the court remanded the case for resentencing because the trial court mistakenly applied a presumptive minimum sentence of 20 years when 15 years was the correct minimum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for rape of a child was affirmed because he committed sexual penetration within the meaning of the rape statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Tennessee district attorney general sought the assistance of a private attorney to investigate sexually oriented businesses. The attorney's expenses were paid by the attorney general's office, but his fees were paid by a private special interest group. When the investigation was completed, the private attorney was appointed special assistant district attorney general and deputy to assist with criminal prosecutions to abate nuisances. The trial court found that the private attorney had a conflict of interest and disqualified him and the entire district attorney general's office, and that defendants' due process rights had been violated and dismissed the indictments against them. The state appealed the decision. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment insofar as it disqualified the private attorney, the district attorney general, and his entire staff, but reversed the judgment insofar as it dismissed the indictments because the court found that defendants' remedy was in the nature of a motion to suppress evidence in the event of trial, rather than dismissal of the indictments.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner filed an application for postconviction relief, which was denied. The trial court allowed petitioner to amend his petition, but still dismissed it for failure to allege a factual basis. Petitioner appealed as of right, alleging that the trial court erred in dismissing his petition for postconviction relief. The court held that pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-206(f), the trial court was obligated to dismiss the petition. Absent the petition alleging a colorable claim for relief, petitioner was not entitled to the appointment of counsel or an evidentiary hearing. The court found that petitioner failed to provide any factual basis for his claims in his petition and that his amended petition added nothing more in the way of relevant allegations except for his claim of ineffective assistance counsel. The court held that petitioner's allegations that counsel failed to interview witnesses, failed to discover evidence not disclosed by the prosecution, and failed to make proper objections during the trial did not carry a hint of deficient performance by counsel or that he was prejudiced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction by the Williamson County Circuit Court (Tennessee) of failure to appear under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-16-609 (1996). Because the underlying offenses were felonies, appellant was sentenced to four years imprisonment which ran consecutively to his eight year sentence for the underlying offenses. Appellant contended that the statute was unconstitutional and that the trial court erred in several of its rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being convicted on a felony charge of forgery and violating the conditions of his alternative sentence, appellant was ordered by the convicting court to surrender himself to the county clerk's office to begin serving his eight year sentence. Appellant failed to report and was subsequently convicted of failure to appear in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-16-609 (1996). Appellant sought review, contending that the statute was unconstitutional and the trial court erred in denying his motion in limine to prohibit the state from impeaching the appellant with his prior conviction for failure to appear and in various other evidentiary rulings. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague by use of the terms &quot;official proceeding&quot; and &quot;reasonable excuse.&quot; The court held that &quot;official proceedings&quot; was unambiguous and the use of a reasonableness standard, by the inclusion of the term &quot;reasonable excuse,&quot; did not render a statute unconstitutionally vague. The court held that appellant's prior conviction was admissible under Tenn. R. Evid. 404(b), to rebut appellant's defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal sought review of a ruling as of right from Madison County (Tennessee), which convicted him of two counts of first degree murder in the deaths of two victims and the aggravated rape of a third victim and sentenced appellant to death by electrocution for the death of the female victim and to life without the possibility of parole for the death of the male victim and to 25 years for the aggravated rape conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal went to his neighbor's house to demand dope, but ended up killing two victims and raping another. Appellant waived his Miranda rights after his arrest. Later, appellant moved to suppress his statements, but was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and of aggravated rape. Appellant sought review as of right. The court did not find any proof that preponderated against the trial court's finding that appellant made a voluntary and knowing statement to law enforcement officials. The court found that the trial court met the constitutional standard for excusing jurors due to their views on the death penalty, there was sufficient evidence to support a finding of both premeditation and deliberation, the evidence supported the aggravating circumstances under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-13-204(i)(5) and (7), and appellant's right to a unanimous jury verdict was not violated. The court found that the statements of future interest were admissible under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule, testimony regarding alleged rape was admissible pursuant to Tenn. R. Evid. 404(b), and the penalty imposed was not disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for first degree murder and the accompanying sentence of death by electrocution and his conviction for aggravated rape and the accompanying sentence of 25 years because the sentence of death was not imposed in any arbitrary fashion because the evidence supported the jury's finding of the statutory aggravating circumstances, which outweighed mitigating circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed his conviction for murder, claiming that he had ineffective assistance of counsel. Petitioner claimed that his attorneys failed to have the portions of the trial transcribed and failed to investigate possible defenses concerning petitioner's mental state. The appellate court affirmed the conviction, explaining that petitioner did not show he was prejudiced by failure to transcribe portions of the trial. Petitioner's attorneys knew portions of the transcript had not been prepared, but they did not raise any issues on appeal that would have required those portions. Additionally, petitioner's attorneys retained a psychologist to examine petitioner before trial. The psychologist indicated that petitioner functioned in the borderline range of intelligence and that substance abuse might have resulted in symptoms similar to brain damage. However, because there was a lack of physical evidence connecting petitioner to the crime, the defense was that he did not commit it. A defense of diminished capacity could have compromised his primary defense that he did not commit the crime. Therefore, counsel was not ineffective for failing to present this defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed, as of right, a judgment from the Criminal Court of Hamilton County (Tennessee), which imposed concurrent sentences of twenty-five and two years, respectively, upon defendant's convictions for the offenses of second degree murder, a Class A felony, and reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon, a Class E felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the convictions and the reckless endangerment sentence, finding that there was sufficient evidence to support criminal defendant's conviction for each offense and that the trial court properly acted in its role as thirteenth juror in refusing to set aside the verdict or to grant defendant a new trial. The appellate court also determined that the denial of defendant's motion for a change of venue based upon pretrial publicity was proper where defendant failed to show that the empanelled jurors were biased or prejudiced against him in light of the fact that all jurors empanelled expressed that they could listen to the evidence and base their verdicts on the evidence. The appellate court then held that the reasonable conditions of defendant's pretrial bond did not implicate double jeopardy issues. However, the appellate court modified the second degree murder sentence to twenty-three years imprisonment where the trial court erred in failing to consider mitigating factors under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-113, given that defendant's lack of sustained intent to violate the law warranted significant weight in the sentencing process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed criminal defendant convictions for second degree murder and reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon, but modified the sentence imposed for the murder conviction where the trial court impermissibly failed to consider the mitigating factor of defendant's lack of sustained intent to violate the law, which was a mitigating circumstance warranting significant weight in the sentencing procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to various crimes in state court and received an effective sentence of 18 years. The sentences were ordered to be served concurrently with a sentence defendant was serving in the federal penitentiary for bank robbery. Defendant was released on parole from federal custody and later returned on new federal charges. Thereafter, the state court issued a capias for defendant's arrest for service of the balance of his state sentence. Defendant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, which was dismissed by the trial court. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred by summarily dismissing the petition without appointing counsel or conducting an evidentiary hearing. The appeals court ruled that because defendant was merely seeking to test the validity of the restraint on his liberty being caused by the capias on an alleged illegal sentence, and not seeking an order for his release, his status as a federal prisoner did not deprive the trial court of any authority to inquire into the matter. The court, therefore, concluded that the trial court was in error by summarily dismissing the habeas corpus petition and reversed and remanded the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to being convicted of aggravated sexual battery, defendant argued that the crime was not a lesser included offense of aggravated rape, the crime for which he was indicted. Reviewing the statutory definitions of both offenses, the court first acknowledged that aggravated sexual battery was a not a lesser included offense of aggravated rape because it required an element that aggravated rape did not require. However, the court nonetheless held that aggravated sexual battery was a lesser grade offense of aggravated rape; thus, the trial court properly instructed the jury regarding the lesser offense. The court then held that the notice of a charged offense implicitly included notice as to any lesser grade offenses. As a result, criminal defendant's constitutional rights to notice were not violated by the failure to explicitly charge aggravated sexual battery in the indictment. The court then upheld the trial court's sentence of defendant because the sentence was appropriately enhanced based on defendant's criminal history.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting defendant of aggravated sexual battery was affirmed because the offense was a lesser grade offense of the crime charged in defendant's indictment.
