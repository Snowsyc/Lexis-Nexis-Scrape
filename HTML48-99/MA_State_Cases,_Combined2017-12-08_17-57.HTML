</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A 15-year-old juvenile was charged with the rape of a child based on a youthful offender indictment under the youthful offender act, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 119, &sect; 54 (as amended through St. 1996, ch. 200, &sect; 2). The juvenile court dismissed the indictment, concluding that the charge of rape of a child did not involve the threat or infliction of serious bodily harm as required by the youthful offender act. On direct appellate review, the court vacated the judgment, because statutory rape was a transferable offense under the youthful offender act. In these circumstances, the invasive nature of the act of penetration, which the Commonwealth would need to prove for rape of a child, created the threat of serious bodily harm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of four counts of stalking under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 43. Defendant appealed and alleged that defendant's pretrial motion to dismiss should have been granted and that the trial court erred by giving improper jury instructions, excluding prior protective orders, and allowing plaintiff prosecutor's cross-examination and closing remarks. Defendant also alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and held that there was substantial evidence to convict defendant and any errors did not result in a substantial miscarriage of justice. Defendant was not entitled to dismissal of stalking in violation of a court order because the order in defendant's divorce judgment required defendant not to harass the victim. Erroneous jury instructions did not materially influence the verdict because there was substantial evidence that defendant stalked the victim repeatedly after an amendment to the stalking law. Any potential prejudice from defendant's counsel's conduct or plaintiff's remarks was immaterial based on the substantial evidence against defendant. Evidence of prior protective orders was irrelevant to the charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Gloucester city council passed, overriding mayor's veto, a home rule petition that requested the Massachusetts legislature to amend the city charter. The Massachusetts Senate, on consideration of the petition, submitted a question of whether the city council approval over mayor's veto was equivalent to approval by the city council and mayor, as constitutionally required to pass a home rule petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council of Gloucester adopted, over the veto of mayor, a home rule petition addressed to the Massachusetts legislature requesting the enactment of a special act changing the city charter. Under Ma. Const. art. 89, &sect; 8, cl. 1, there were three methods by which a city could petition the legislature to enact legislation that affected only that city. First, by petition filed or approved by the voters of a city. Second, by petition filed by a mayor and city council; and third, by petition from the town meeting of a town. The Massachusetts Senate, upon reviewing the bill, submitted a question to the court as to whether the city council's override of mayor's veto of a home rule petition constituted approval by a mayor and the city council of that city. The court held that where state constitution gave directions respecting the times or modes of proceeding in which a power should be exercised, there was at least a strong presumption that it should be exercised in that time and mode only. Accordingly, the court answered that where approval by both mayor and city council was required to approve an action, the approval of both was required, not just one or the other.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, in response to the question submitted by the Massachusetts Senate, determined that the city council's override of mayor's veto of a home rule petition did not satisfy the constitutional requirement that the petition be approved by mayor and the city council.</SPAN></P>

Upon a jury-waived trial, defendant was found guilty. Defendant appealed the conviction, which was reversed by reason of defendant's lack of criminal responsibility. Plaintiff sought further appellate review, which was granted. The court reversed judgment in favor of plaintiff and held that the evidence, including defendant's disposition at the time of arrest, his ability to answer questions during booking, and his cooperative nature, all warranted a finding of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was criminally responsible at the time of the crime. Further, the court held that it would continue to require the burden of proof of sanity be placed on plaintiff, rather than placing a burden of lack of criminal responsibility on defendant. The court held that precedent, and lack of controlling legislation, influenced the court's decision not to shift the burden of proof of insanity to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted, by jury, of murder and armed robbery. The jury recommended the death penalty. Thereafter, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated the type of procedure under which petitioner was sentenced. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions, but vacated the death sentences and remanded for resentencing to life imprisonment. Petitioner filed a petition for habeas corpus relief, contending that the court had no authority to resentence him to life imprisonment, because it was the jury, not the court, which had the power to recommend a life sentence in place of execution. A single justice denied the petition, and the appellate court affirmed. The court found petitioner's claims were not based on grounds distinct from the issues at the indictment, trial, conviction, or sentencing. Furthermore, petitioner opposed a matter of sentencing. As such, a petition for habeas corpus would not lie, because petitioner was not entitled to immediate release. The court found that the most petitioner was entitled to was resentencing, not release.

Gen. Laws ch. 138, &sect; 14, and Mass. Regs. Code tit. 204, &sect; 2.05(2) (1993). That decision was reversed on judicial review on the ground that Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 136, &sect; 6(52), which provided an exception to the Sunday sales prohibition for municipalities located within ten miles of the New Hampshire or Vermont border, violated state and federal principles of equal protection and due process. Defendant appealed, and plaintiff's application for direct appellate review was granted. On appeal, the court reversed and entered judgment in defendant's favor. Plaintiff did not claim that it was a member of a suspect group or that a fundamental interest was involved. Also, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 136, &sect; 6(52) served the legitimate purposes of capturing tax revenue, retaining business that otherwise would have been lost to the bordering states, and promoting the public convenience, and it was rationally related to achieving those purposes.

The appeals court affirmed the suppression order, concluding that the trooper had no reasonable basis to support his order to the defendant to step out of the taxicab. The prosecution was granted further review and urged the court to adopt the United States Supreme Court rule holding that a police officer does not violate the U.S. Const. amend. IV when, in a routine traffic stop, he orders a passenger out of the vehicle. The court declined, holding that Mass. Const. art. 14 required that a police officer, in a routine traffic stop, must have had a reasonable belief that the officer's safety, or the safety of others, was in danger before ordering a driver out of a motor vehicle.

After she failed to do so, her probation officer filed a criminal complaint to find her in contempt. Defendant's motion to dismiss was granted, and the state appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that Juvenile Courts lacked the authority to issue direct orders against juveniles except when as a condition of custody. For criminal contempt to issue, the underlying order had to be valid. Because the order directing defendant to attend school was beyond the scope of the Juvenile Court's authority, the order was not valid; therefore, defendant could not be charged with criminal contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, including attorneys, staff, and clients of a law firm, moved to dismiss insurance fraud indictments that were prosecuted by the insurance fraud division of the state attorney general's (AG) office. The motion was denied and the matter was forwarded via applications for direct appellate review. Defendants claimed that the statutorily prescribed funding scheme for insurance company underwriting of investigations and prosecutions conducted by the insurance fraud division of the AG's office, found in 1996 Mass. Acts ch. 427, &sect; 13, was unconstitutional and violated due process. Specifically, defendants asserted that the AG's office was not disinterested because it relied upon insurance companies for funding. On review, the appellate court determined that there was the possibility of improper influence by private interests on the exercise of prosecutorial discretion because of the closeness of the AG to the private interest groups. However, the court concluded that defendants had not demonstrated that their constitutional rights had been violated by the statutory pattern where they failed to show bias. Therefore, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was arrested past midnight for driving while under the influence of alcohol, he told police that he wanted to exercise his right under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 263, &sect; 5A to an independent medical examination. He was not able to exercise that right, however, because the bail magistrate refused to hold a bail hearing at that time of night. Defendant thereafter successfully moved to dismiss the complaint, alleging a deprivation of his right to a prompt bail hearing and of his right to an independent medical examination. The court held that the violation of defendant's &sect; 5A right was prima facie evidence that he was prejudiced in that his opportunity to obtain and present potentially exculpatory evidence had been restricted or destroyed. This presumption of prejudice, however, could be overcome by overwhelming evidence of intoxication or by other evidence indicating that the omission was not prejudicial in the circumstances. Thus, the case was remanded for a determination of whether the evidence of defendant's intoxication was overwhelming or whether other factors rendered the violation harmless under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed a judgment from the City of Boston Division of the Suffolk Housing Court Department (Massachusetts), which granted plaintiff real estate board's motion for summary judgment in plaintiff's action seeking a declaration that defendant's ordinance, Boston, Mass., Ordinances ch. 3 (1996), was invalid on the ground that it exceeded the authority vested in defendant by the enabling statute, Mass.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff real estate board brought an action seeking a declaration that defendant city's ordinance, Boston, Mass., Ordinances ch. 3 (1996) (the ordinance), was invalid. The trial court granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and struck down the entire ordinance, holding that it exceeded the authority granted to defendant by the enabling act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 527 (1983) (the enabling act). The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court determined that the definition of &quot;tenant&quot; contained in the ordinance was overly broad because the ordinance applied to tenants taking occupancy after there had been a conversion to condominiums or cooperative. The enabling act authorized protection of tenants from the hardships associated with condominium conversion, not protection of tenants who moved into a unit long after it had become a condominium unit. Further, the invalid elements of the ordinance were too entwined with the rest of the ordinance to permit the court to excise them and to enforce the remainder of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance, which provided protection for tenants involved in condominium conversions, was facially invalid where it exceeded the authority granted by the enabling statute because it afforded protection to tenants who took occupancy after the conversion.</SPAN></P>

Rather, defendant's program considered the appropriateness of plaintiffs' medical services on a case-by-case basis based on a retrospective evaluation of the patients' ailments and outcome, and then imposed a severe all-or-nothing penalty for treatment in the wrong setting. Since defendant failed to take into account the risk to the patient as assessed by the physician at the time of admission, defendant's administrative action was arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the order that granted the injunction. The court first noted that the trial court properly determined that the zoning scheme confined adult businesses to 0.11 percent of defendant city's total developable land and that defendant city was obligated, as a practical matter, to ensure that its regulatory scheme did not unreasonably foreclose avenues for communication of the material plaintiff intended to sell. The court ruled, therefore, that the preliminary injunction was properly entered because defendant city failed to show that plaintiff had been left with reasonable alternative means of communication and because defendant city did not present any information explaining why it was reasonable to restrict adult businesses to such a minuscule portion of the developable land in the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts asked the court to consider a proposed statute in an advisory opinion. The court was asked to respond to three questions regarding the constitutionality of Section 2 of H.R. 5822 (Mass. 1998), which proposed a reduction in the surcharge on vehicular rental transaction contracts for city residents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts requested that the court issue an advisory opinion as to whether the enactment of Section 2 of H.R. 5822 (Mass. 1998), in reducing a city's surcharge on vehicular rental transaction contracts for city residents, would violate the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court determined that the bill proposed a facially discriminatory tax that violated the commerce clause because it plainly imposed a different burden on vehicle renters who were nonresidents than on those vehicle renters who were city residents. The rental of vehicles in the city was an aspect of interstate transportation because many renters were interstate travelers who affected interstate commerce regardless of whether they traveled as tourists or for business purposes. To the extent that vehicles were rented for commercial use, the proposed measure discriminated against out-of-state businesses as well as nonresidents. The local purposes of funding a convention center and reducing permanent ownership of motor vehicles by city residents were better pursued by taxes that did not discriminate on the basis of residency.</SPAN></P>

The court declined to address whether the bill violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution or the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the legislature removed all discretionary language when it amended &sect; 8 (2).

News articles profiled retirees who appeared to be profiting simultaneously from their disability pensions and from private careers, even though some of their private pursuits involved physical demands equal to, or greater than, those that had been imposed on them in their civil service positions. Employee was entitled to reinstatement. The court also declined to hold &sect; 8 (2)&nbsp;unconstitutional according to the City's argument, as it created an absolute preference in favor of disability retirees, thus violating Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 6 and 7. Case-by-case evaluations were conducted of each individual employee and only after the medical panel evaluated the employee would reinstatement have been ordered.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed that an evidentiary hearing was required on the appropriateness of the risk classifications. However, the court determined that the hearing was required to be conducted by the board. To satisfy constitutional due process, the board was required to show by a preponderance of evidence that it had properly classified the sex offenders and that close attention was given to the evidence; detailed findings were required. Because the sex offenders had a privacy interest in avoiding registration, but did not face a potential loss of liberty or a stigma as great as that flowing from a criminal conviction, a higher standard of proof was not warranted. The preponderance of the evidence standard did not create an unusual risk of an erroneous classification and a higher standard of proof would have been unduly burdensome and inconsistent with the goal of protecting the public from recidivistic sex offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders requiring an evidentiary hearing before the trial courts and invalidating portions of the Sex Offender Registration Act were vacated, and the sex offenders' classifications were vacated. The cases were remanded to the board for evidentiary hearings at which the burden would be on the board to show the propriety of the classifications by a preponderance of the evidence and to make specific fact findings supporting its classifications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Massachusetts Turnpike Authority was financed by bonds that were paid off by tolls that were collected on the turnpike. Trust agreements gave the bondholders a security interest in the revenues that were generated by the tolls. The backers of an initiative proposed to reduce, then eliminate, the tolls on the roads managed by the Turnpike Authority. The attorney general certified that the initiative petition did not concern matters excluded from the initiative process under Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights amend. art. 48, Part II, &sect; 3. The court overturned the attorney general's certification and ordered the county court to enter judgment declaring that the certification was improper. The court held that the bondholders' security interest was property protected by Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 10 and by the takings clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal constitution. Because there was no specific provision providing for the repayment of the bondholders, the court ruled that the appropriation of the bondholders' property was inconsistent with their right to receive compensation under Mass.

On appeal, the court found that although it seemed illogical that the owner of a private home was entitled to less advance notice of steps that should be taken to correct a building code violation than was the owner of a commercial or industrial building covered by &sect; 51, such a determination was a legislative judgment. The court held that the state, inappropriately but without objection, had been required at the jury trial to prove compliance with &sect; 51's notice requirement. The court concluded that its decision that &sect; 51 was inapplicable to single-family residences would not unconstitutionally apply a retroactive redefinition of the crime with which defendants were charged. The court reversed the convictions and remanded for a retrial because since the charges were unsupported by a detailed notice of required remedial action, various charges could have been impermissibly vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant revenue commissioner (commissioner) appealed the judgment from the Superior Court of Suffolk County (Massachusetts), which declared that Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, &sect; 63.39.1(5) (1993), regarding the state's excise tax, as applied to the members of plaintiff trade association, was preempted by 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 381 and that &sect; 381 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trade association had more than 1,000 foreign corporation members that operated their own truck fleets to deliver their products. The members solicited sales of tangible goods in the state. The orders were sent outside the state for approval and were filled outside the state. Based on the members' use of their own trucks to make deliveries in the state, the commissioner imposed excise taxes against them under Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, &sect; 63.39.1(5) (1993) (regulation). The trade association sought a declaration that 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 381 preempted the regulation. The superior court entered judgment for the trade association. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. Section 381 precluded state income taxes on foreign corporations whose business within the state consisted solely of the solicitation for sales of tangible goods, which orders were sent outside the state for approval and were filled outside the state. The statute did not require that the transfer occur outside the state. Congress had the authority under the commerce clause to prohibit states from imposing taxes that interfered with interstate commerce. Thus, the Tenth Amendment was not implicated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the superior court's judgment declaring that federal law preempted the state regulation regarding excise taxes and that the federal law was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that Mass. Const. art. 2, cl. 3 when strictly construed prevented the court from responding to the governor's questions. Regarding the petitions pending before the legislature and whether they were substantially similar to an existing statute, the court held that under Mass. Const. art. 48, The Initiative, Part II, &sect; 3, the attorney general had to make that determination. Therefore, the court was not asked to answer a question related to the governor's power or authority, and because no solemn occasion existed the court could not respond. On the next question, the governor's concern over the possibility that the legislature might have refused to act on petitions before it, again did not raise a solemn occasion. Thus, the court declined to answer. The governor's final questions regarding when he could call a joint session or require the legislature to take action on matters if it chose not to, the court held that these questions sought advisory opinions because they were not based upon any existing occasion that called for an opinion.

Based on its practice of allowing flexibility in the treatment of employees who habitually used alcohol in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &sect; 50, the commission determined that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 41, &sect; 101A had not required mandatory termination and ordered the officer reinstated upon demonstration that the officer no longer used tobacco. Thereafter, the town brought an action against the commission. When the trial court dismissed the action, the town sought review. In vacating the judgment and upholding the town's decision to terminate the officer, the court held the personnel administration rules, which had required mandatory termination, had been consistent with the legislative directive. Thus, the rules had acquired the force of law. Moreover, the court noted that while Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &sect; 50 contained discretionary language, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 41, &sect; 101A contained no such language, and that the legislative purposes behind the two statutes was different.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters' group questioned the constitutionality of a proposed law, arising from an initiative, that would have prevented an incumbent's name from being printed on a state ballot as a candidate after the incumbent had served a certain number of consecutive terms, and that would have prevented those persons so elected from collecting a salary. The court held that the proposed law was unconstitutional insofar as it sought to limit access to election ballots and sought to eliminate the compensation and benefits for incumbents reelected in an election in which their names were not printed on the ballot. The court found that the constitution established the qualifications of candidates and that it did not authorize the people to change the qualifications by initiative. Limiting the right of incumbent candidates to have their name on the ballots was tantamount to evading the constitution's requirements. Although Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights arts. 8, 9 granted the right of the people to enact laws, the people failed to grant themselves the authority by the initiative process to prescribe qualifications for office beyond those stated in the constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff developer filed suit against defendant Cape Cod Commission (commission), seeking judicial review and declaratory relief from the commission's denial of a development permit. The Land Court (Massachusetts) determined that the denial of the permit constituted a taking under both the federal and the Massachusetts constitutions and, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 716 (1989), ordered the commission to approve the development.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer requested a permit to remove sand and gravel from 35 acres that were zoned as agricultural. The plan included reclamation as required by the local zoning by-laws. The municipal authority referred the request to the commission, who denied the permit. The developer filed suit under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 716, &sect; 17(b) (1989). The land court determined that even though the land might have had substantial value for other development, the denial of the permit was a &quot;taking.&quot; On appeal, the court held that the issue was not yet ripe for adjudication because there had not yet been a final determination on the nature and extent of the development that the commission would permit. The court noted that the commission had proposed an alternate plan to permit sand and gravel extraction on 25 acres, and held that this proposal demonstrated that the commission was willing to consider less extensive mining proposals. The court noted that the property had substantial value for alternative uses permitted under the applicable zoning regulations and held that the developer had not shown that there was a taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer's employment was terminated after he was convicted of two felonies, one of which arose from a scheme in which the officer stole and sold advance copies of the police entrance and promotion examinations and answers. The officer had supplied his son with a copy of the entrance exam that the son then used to obtain employment as a police officer. The court found no grounds for reversal. The subject statute was clearly restitutionary, and the officer was not deprived of property that exceeded his misappropriation. Further, the statute was not so punitive as to overcome its restitutionary purpose. The officer was accorded all of the process to which he was due under the statute because he was granted a hearing at which he was permitted to present evidence, cross-examine, and seek judicial review. The board's decision was supported by substantial evidence. Issues of credibility as to a witness against the officer were for the board to determine. The officer was properly held responsible for misappropriation because he caused payments to be made to his son, in the form of paychecks fraudulently obtained by the son through the use of the stolen entrance exam and answers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was suspected of supplying drug dealers with marijuana. The police obtained an anticipatory search warrant that complied with Mass. Gen.

The event was not set forth in the warrant or attached to the warrant. The drug dealer left the premises but was apprehended far away; marijuana was found but its source was not known. Defendant's home was searched regardless. The court found that this was improper because the triggering event, as described, had not occurred. Consequently, defendant's motion to suppress should have been allowed. The court disagreed with the lower appellate court's reasoning, explicitly holding that the search warrant did not need to contain the description of the triggering event. The court stated that it was sufficient if it was described in the affidavit making application for the warrant. The court held that neither U.S. Const. amend. IV nor Mass. Const. art. 14 required a description of the triggering event in the warrant itself or attached to the warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that Mass. Gen.

The court then considered the merits, concluding that (1) the peaceful begging engaged in by the complainant was similar to soliciting funds for charities and therefore involved communicative activity protected by the First Amendment; (2) the criminal sanction, imposed on such activity by ch. 272, &sect; 66, was content-and viewpoint-based and banned the activity in traditional public forums; and (3) as a result, the statute was subject to strict scrutiny, a test which the statute failed as there was no compelling state interest warranting punishment for panhandling.</SPAN></P>

The department conducted an investigation finding that the mother was of borderline intelligence and that the father used her public assistance money to buy drugs. The oldest child was diagnosed as suffering from post traumatic distress syndrome. She told the investigators that her father was a &quot;witch&quot; and took pictures of her with her clothes off. She also described sexual touching. One of the sons also described sexual abuse and exhibited inappropriate, aggressive sexual behavior. The children were found to be filthy. They did not understand even basic personal hygiene. The court ruled that the children's out-of-court statements concerning the sexual abuse were not necessary to support a conclusion of parental unfitness. The court, therefore, so did not rule on the constitutional challenge the parents made to admission of the statements, although it analyzed the issue for the benefit of future cases.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because no contribution was required from the recipient's former spouse, and the former spouse's assets were not included when determining the recipient's eligibility for benefits, it was rational for the division to disallow a deduction for the family's maintenance needs. The disallowance was not an invasion of the recipient's liberty interests. The state was not constitutionally obligated to subsidize his support payments. That the recipient no longer had the financial resources to support his children as he once agreed did not mean that any coercive constitutional burdens were placed on him. The division's decision to include the child support payments in the recipient's available income was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. The regulations were consistent with the statutory scheme and with the reasonable exercise of authority by the division.</SPAN></P>

A claim of appeal was entered, but an order of dismissal was later docketed. Defendant eventually was released on parole but was reincarcerated after his parole was revoked. A single justice of the appellate court reinstated defendant's appellate right and granted defendant leave to file a motion for a new trial in the trial court. The trial court granted defendant's motion, holding that the jury instructions on reasonable doubt were constitutionally deficient. The instructions equated proof beyond a reasonable doubt with moral certainty and described moral certainty as the level of certainty required in making decisions in matters of the highest importance concerning one's own personal affairs. The trial court then explained the meaning of moral certainty through the use of illustrations involving the decisions to marry, buy a new house, or leave a long held job. The appellate court agreed that the instructions could not withstand constitutional scrutiny. Hence, the court affirmed the trial court's order allowing defendant's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth sought direct appellate review of decisions of the Superior Court Department (Massachusetts), which granted new trials to two defendants and denied a new trial to a third in cases arising out of the same allegations of child abuse.

The female defendants' request for a new trial, on the grounds that special seating arrangements for the child witnesses deprived them of their right to meet witnesses against them face to face as guaranteed by Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 12, was granted; the male defendant's similar request was denied. The court reversed the grant of a new trial to the female defendants and affirmed the denial of a new trial to the male defendant. The court held that, although defendants' right to have the witnesses face them was violated by the seating arrangement, in which witnesses were seated facing the jury, defendants did not object even when the judge suggested he would consider confrontation clause objections. Further, defendants did not meet their burden of showing there was a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice in the waiver because all of the witnesses testified under oath in the physical presence of the defendants and there were several actual face-to-face encounters throughout the trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that &sect; 12S's parental consent-judicial bypass provision did not, on its face, deny a pregnant minor due process of law. The claim that a pregnant unmarried minor was denied equal protection of the laws failed because the classification made by &sect; 12S had a rational basis. However, the requirement that, with certain exceptions, the minor had to obtain the consent of both parents to her having an abortion, or else had to seek judicial approval, lacked sufficient justification to overcome the burden that the two-parent consent requirement placed on the minor's constitutional right to choose. To require that the minor follow a judicial bypass process when the purpose of parental consent was fulfilled by the consent of one parent would burden the minor's constitutional rights without adequate justification. The court held that the attorney general conscientiously and professionally represented the interests of the group opposed to abortion, and intervention, as opposed to status as a friend of the court filing a brief, was not needed for the group to make its point that the judicial bypass made unimportant any defect in the two-parent consent requirement.</SPAN></P>

The protester's activity was outside of the realm of constitutionally protected speech. U.S. Const. amend. I did not shelter the trespasser's practice of hollering into the clinic, blocking or obstructing patients, or her persistent violation of an existing court order against such conduct. The governmental interest in ensuring public safety, protecting a woman's freedom to seek lawful medical and counseling services, protecting the physical and psychological well-being of patients, and maintaining the integrity of court orders were significant enough to justify an appropriately tailored injunction to secure unimpeded physical access to the clinics.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife brought an action against the city alleging negligence, wrongful death, civil rights violation, and related claims for failure to take action to protect the decedent while in custody. The lower court entered summary judgment for the city, and the court transferred the case on its own motion on appeal. The court found no evidence the city knew the decedent was suicidal even though he had complained of drug withdrawal, and therefore summary judgment was proper on the negligence claim. The court also found that the wife failed to strictly comply with Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 258, &sect; 4 because her written claim described the wrongful acts of the court employees but not the city, and there was no proper presentment. Therefore summary judgment in favor of the city was proper.

After passing the California bar examination, the attorney practiced law in California for 12 years. The court's rules committee declined to grant a waiver to the attorney. The attorney alleged that he was denied equal protection because, unlike him, graduates of foreign law schools were eligible for admission even though their schools were not ABA approved. The court rejected the attorney's argument, and affirmed the single justice's dismissal. The court held that it was reasonable for the court to provide an independent evaluation for graduates of foreign law schools because the ABA did not evaluate foreign law schools. The court also rejected the attorney's argument that graduates of Massachusetts law schools not approved by the ABA were eligible to take the Massachusetts bar examination.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant argued that &sect; 11A was unconstitutional on its face in that it did not allow either party to present as of right its own medical testimony in addition to that of the impartial medical examiner. The court found as an initial matter that resolution of the question was sufficiently important that it was prudent for the court to answer it even though aspects of justiciability were missing. Applying the Mathews due process analysis, the court weighed two matters: the governmental interest in giving the impartial report &quot;prima facie&quot; status and the effect of that status in the scheme in which contestants' rights were adjudicated. The court found that the government's interest in efficiency benefited workers, employers, and insurers and did not come at too high a price. The court reasoned that &sect; 11A(2) provided explicitly that the administrative judge could authorize the submission of additional medical testimony when necessary. There was no rule of due process that gave a party an unrestricted right to present any testimony he chose. Claimant had sufficient opportunity to develop medical testimony she considered favorable to her claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts adopted an order transmitting two questions to the court with the request that the court provide answers to the questions, which concerned a proposed amendment to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &sect; 4(1A) (1994). The court had previously held that &sect; 4(1A) violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prior &sect; 4(1A) had protected an employee against being required to work on a day of religious observance if the employee's sincerely held religious belief was shared by others belonging to an organized church or sect, but not if such a belief was not so similarly shared. The questions asked whether the amended &sect; 4(1A), which defined the term &quot;creed or religion&quot; to encompass sincerely held beliefs regardless of whether they were approved by an established church, violated the establishment clause and the state constitution, and whether its retroactive applicability violated due process. The court answered the first question in the negative, stating that the amendment removed the constitutional violations previously identified, and that by permitting an employer to show that accommodation to an employee's religious observance would cause undue hardship it took account of the employer's interests. The court set forth relevant considerations but determined that it should not definitively answer the second question, because the answer would depend on the facts of each case and the court had been unwilling to provide opinions on issues that could be raised in pending litigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of a single justice of the court, which denied defendant relief after a detention order was issued under Mass.

The court also granted direct appellate review to a separate defendant on the constitutionality of &sect; 58A at the request of the Appeals Court of Massachusetts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with numerous violent crimes. After defendant was indicted, the commonwealth sought a detention order for dangerousness under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 58A (1994), which was granted after a hearing. Defendant appealed to a single justice of the court, challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 58A. The justice denied relief, and defendant appealed. A separate defendant sought direct appellate review of the constitutionality of a three-day continuance prior to a hearing for dangerousness under &sect; 58A. The court consolidated the appeals. The court held that &sect; 58A did not violate defendant's due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mass. Const. art. I, X, XII, and XXVI, because it required probable cause that defendant committed a serious crime in addition to clear and convincing evidence of his future dangerousness. Section 58A did not contradict the provisions of the Bail Reform Act of 1984. A three-day continuance under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 58A(4), prior to the detention hearing was not unconstitutional because the commonwealth was required to show good cause for it. The continuance properly allowed police to gather evidence for the hearing.</SPAN></P>

XLIV, which required a single taxation rate on income derived from a single class of property, because capital assets would have been taxed at more than one rate under 1994 Mass. Acts ch. 195. The taxpayers sought declaratory relief enjoining the Commissioner of Revenue from spending money to enforce ch. 195, and requiring the Commissioner of Revenue administer laws as they stood before ch. 195. The taxpayers claimed they had standing under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 29, &sect; 63 (1994) and under the &quot;public right doctrine.&quot; The court vacated the lower court's order denying dismissal and ordered dismissal. The court found that the taxpayers lacked standing because 1994 Mass. Acts ch. 195 itself did not call for the disputed expenditures.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Massachusetts Senate sought an advisory opinion, pursuant to Mass. Const. Part II, ch. 3, art. 2, as amended by art. 85 of the Amendments, to determine whether proposed sex offender registration legislation,&nbsp;Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 6 &sect; 174B, violated the United States Constitution or state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the proposed sex offender registration law was constitutional because the new law was not a violation of: (1) the ex post facto provision because it was not designed to punish, but to regulate; (2) procedural due process because the procedures met the constitutional requirements of a civil, remedial standard; (3) equal protection because the law was not overinclusive; (4) the right to privacy because the state's regulatory interest in public safety outweighed any stigma attached to being a known, convicted sex offender; (5) the Eighth Amendment because the statute also applied to out-of-state convicted sex offenders, whom Massachusetts had no authority to punish; (6) the Double Jeopardy Clause because the law was a civil sanction imposed for the same actions on which a criminal penalty had previously been imposed and was proportionate to the law's remedial aims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the proposed Massachusetts sex offender registration legislation did not violate the constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On learning of the sale of the manufactured housing community where its members lived, plaintiff tenants' association requested information regarding the terms of the sale from defendant buyer. Plaintiff planned to tender an offer to purchase the property on substantially similar terms in an effort to exercise its statutory right of first refusal under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 32R. Defendant refused to provide the information and plaintiff filed suit. The lower court granted plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment and awarded specific performance. On appeal, the court affirmed. The statute did not create an unconstitutional taking. It served the legitimate goals of avoiding discontinuances of manufactured housing communities and ensuring that tenants were not left at the peril of their landlords due to a practical inability to relocate a manufactured housing unit. It did not deprive an owner of economically viable use of the land. The owner was not required to sell to tenants on terms less favorable than could be received from a third party. The award of specific performance was wholly consistent with both the common law and the mandates of Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 93A.</SPAN></P>

The father argued that this made the support issues moot. The mother countered that the support issues were not moot because the current custody arrangement was temporary and in place to help the mother overcome an alleged substance abuse problem. The court held that, because the amended temporary order continued to suspend the child support obligations and continued to grant the father sole legal and physical custody of the children, it rendered the child support issues moot. The mother sought to repudiate the divorce agreement in respect to both the cohabitation clause and to its evident intent to give separate consideration to her and her children's support. At the same time, she disagreed with the probate judge's independent evaluation of her needs because she did not like his conclusion that she earned sufficient money, so that the father was not required to pay her alimony at the present time. The court affirmed the suspension of the spousal support payments whether by looking to the intent of the parties or by virtue of an independent examination of the mother's needs.</SPAN></P>

Under the scheme, the candidate who stood twelfth in the election was selected, rather than plaintiff, the candidate who stood tenth. The court upheld the dismissal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the Commonwealth's case against defendants was sufficient to warrant the jury verdicts. The court further held that the police officers had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's vehicle because the vehicle matched the description of witnesses. The court held that the subsequent warrantless search of the vehicle was properly upheld under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement. The court rejected one defendant's contention that he was denied ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to impeach a police officer's testimony of what defendant was wearing when he was arrested. The court held that the failure to impeach, on a full and reasonable assessment of the trial record, would not have played an important role in the jury's deliberations. Finally, the court held that the use at trial of the telephone number that one defendant called during his booking did not violate the defendant's constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions for first-degree murder, armed assault with intent to murder, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Defendant claimed the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on lack of criminal responsibility, in its malice instruction, and in denying his motion to suppress voluntary statements made at the police station. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court found that the trial judge properly refused the instruction on the issue of criminal responsibility because there was no evidence that defendant suffered from a prior mental illness and the record revealed that he was calm and lucid before and after the crimes. The court held that the trial judge properly instructed the jury regarding the three elements for malice, thus his inclusion of an extra instruction regarding selfish motive did not constitute reversible error. The court held that the delay between defendant's arrest and the time he was booked and advised of his right to make a telephone call under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 33A and Miranda rights was not designed to gain inculpatory information but to allow the officers involved to be present at booking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, on its own initiative transferred the case from the appellate court. This was defendant's third conviction for DUI. The second time defendant was charged with DUI, he was not charged as a second offender because the second offense was not within six years of the first as required by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24(1)(a)(1) (1992 ed.). On defendant's third offense, ch. 90, &sect; 24(1)(a)(1) (1994) had been enacted, which extended the reach-back for a second offense to 10 years and made the third offense a felony. Defendant was convicted of a third DUI and given prison time. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court ruled that: (1) his third-time conviction did not violate constitutional protections against ex post facto laws because his prior offenses only related to the punishment he received for the current offense: (2) his due process rights were not violated because he had fair warning that if he violated the new statute, his punishment could be enhanced by his prior convictions; and (3) it was not unconstitutional to treat defendant's prior two misdemeanor convictions as &quot;like offenses&quot; because the elements of each underlying criminal act remained the same.</SPAN></P>

He filed a motion to dismiss arguing that a previous declaratory action and a money settlement in exchange for her assent to a stipulation that he was not the child's father barred the action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The putative father alleged that the trial judge erred in not barring the action, in admitting evidence of a genetic marker test, and in awarding support and counsel fees to the child. On direct appellate review, the court held that even if the mother had been properly acting on behalf of the child, the settlement agreement was subject to disaffirmance by the child who was not a party to the settlement and there was no res judicata effect. There was no impairment of contract when the state law, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 209C, &sect; 22(d), authorized the child to act and it was constitutional. The mother was not a legal representative of the child in the first action, so the child cannot be barred from pursuing her legal rights and there was no detrimental reliance, estoppel, or laches. The court found that a letter from the putative father to the mother was relevant as either to show that she considered him to be the father or to explain why he started visiting the child and was not excluded as hearsay. The putative father's claim of error as to the child support was premature because it was a temporary order. There was no statutory authorization for the child to be awarded attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24(1)(a)(1) (1994) was denied by the trial court. On appeal, the court held that the Commonwealth's earlier suspension of defendant's drivers license for refusing to submit to a breath test, pursuant to Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24(1)(f)(1), did not render the criminal charge a violation of defendant's Double Jeopardy Clause protections. The administrative license suspension was a reasonable sanction primarily designed to promote public safety, and not &quot;punishment&quot; for purposes of attachment of double jeopardy. Therefore, defendant failed to show that multiple punishments arose. Further, the &sect; 24(1)(a)(1) offense and the refusal to submit to a breath test violation, pursuant to Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24(1)(g), were not the same offense for purposes of double jeopardy. The requirement that defendant submit to a breath test was only an element of &sect; 24(1)(g), and separate sanctions were authorized for the offenses.

Defendant was charged with stalking the victim in violation of &sect; 43. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court concluded that the amount and content of the letters that defendant sent to the victim allowed the jury to conclude that defendant intended to place the victim in fear of imminent bodily injury and that the victim was afraid of defendant. After defendant's conviction, &sect; 43 was found to be unconstitutionally vague. Because defendant did not challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 43 at his trial, the court could only consider whether defendant's conviction under the statute as enacted, created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. Regardless of the vagueness of portions of the statute, defendant's conduct was clearly prohibited harassment. The statute gave the defendant fair notice that his repeated, obsessive behavior, which interfered with the victim's personal and professional lives, was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving a car down a street when he hit a man who had just parked his car on the side of the road. Defendant did not stop until the police pursued him. Once stopped, the police determined that he was intoxicated and arrested him. Defendant presented evidence that he was not intoxicated and that his blood alcohol content was never tested. The jury was instructed with reference to the lack of such testing and defense counsel objected to the charge. The particular instruction was declared unconstitutional in a decision after defendant was convicted. Defendant argued that this decision should be applied retroactively. The court found that the error in giving the instruction was not harmless because it raised an improper inference about defendant's allegedly intoxicate state. Thus, the court reversed his convictions for homicide by a motor vehicle and operating a motor vehicle while under the influence. Defendant's motion for a finding of not guilty should have been allowed on the subsequent offense charge because the commonwealth did not prove that defendant was actually the same person as the defendant named in the three prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment of homicide by motor vehicle and operating the same while under the influence and remanded for further proceedings. The court also reversed the judgment of being a subsequent offender and directed a judgment to be entered for defendant.</SPAN></P>

The driver of one of the vehicles indicated to police that the accident had been caused by the manner in which the other vehicle was being driven. The police concluded that defendant had operated the second vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor. On appeal from his conviction, defendant argued that the Commonwealth's evidence was insufficient to warrant a finding that he was the operator of the second vehicle involved in the accident. The court found that the finding was warranted, as defendant's admission that he had been driving the vehicle was adequately corroborated by the other driver's statement to police. The court also rejected defendant's argument that he was entitled to retroactive application of a rule that a jury was not to be instructed on the availability of blood alcohol testing when no evidence of such testing was presented at trial. The court based its holding on the fact that an opinion had been presented to the legislature, indicating that a law to allow the admission into evidence of a defendant's refusal to submit to a blood alcohol test would have violated the self-incrimination provision of Mass.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. His motions for new trial were denied, and a single justice of the court, acting as &quot;gatekeeper&quot; under Mass. Gen.

The court affirmed, rejecting plaintiff's arguments that the &quot;gatekeeper&quot; provision violated his due process and equal protection rights, concluding that the gatekeeper provision merely screened out appeals that lack merit by requiring a single justice to give approval for a full court review.</SPAN></P>

The students and parents of students filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief based on a violation of their constitutional rights. The trial court granted summary judgment for the school officials. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that (1) the mere exposure to the condom program offered at school did not amount to unconstitutional interference with parental liberties without some compulsory aspect to the program; (2) neither an opt-out nor parental notification provision was required by the federal constitution; (3) although the program might offend the religious sensibilities of the students and parents of students, mere exposure to the program without compulsion did not amount to a violation of the free exercise clause of the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner determined that competition was insufficient to assure that private passenger automobile insurance rates would not be excessive and, thus, invoked the procedures of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &sect; 113B, to fix and establish the rates. The court affirmed the commissioner's decision, which resulted in an over-all rate reduction of 6.1 percent. The court found that the commissioner properly reduced loss pure premiums for bodily injury coverage to reflect anticipated savings from the 1994 seat belt law. The court rejected the association's arguments that the reduction was not authorized, that the model used to establish the amount of the reduction was faulty, and that the inputs used in applying the model were improper. The court also found that the commissioner properly concluded that an increase in premium rates was not warranted by a regulatory change in the use of referral shops and the deregulation of the towing industry. Finally, the court concluded that the association did not satisfy its burden of proving that the rates were unconstitutionally confiscatory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband challenged the constitutionality of the trial court's order that issued a preliminary and permanent abuse prevention order pursuant to Mass.

The court affirmed and held that although a trial court other than the issuing trial court vacated the orders upon motion of appellant, the issue was not moot because the court found that records containing the issuance of the order might have an adverse effect on appellant in the future. The court held that ch. 209A did not violate appellant's right to a jury trial under Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. XII. The court reasoned that an order that affected access to property pursuant to ch. 209A was not punitive in purpose. The court found no right to a jury trial pursuant to Mass. Const. Declarations of Rights art. XV in a ch. 209A action, because there was no right to a jury trial in domestic abuse cases prior to 1780.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was based on the complaint of a mother and daughter that alleged that he pulled down his pants in front of them, revealing his pubic area. On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to warrant the conclusion that he had exposed his genitalia and that the statute under which he was convicted did not adequately apprise him that his actions could have subjected him to punishment. Upon review, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The testimony concerning defendant's pulling down of the right side of his bathing suit or shorts was insufficient to support an inference by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that his conduct at that point had necessarily exposed some portion of his genitalia.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 53 (1992) had not been construed by judicial decision to apply to an intentional exposure of the genital area or the pubic hair. Therefore, the court was unable to conclude that the term indecent exposure, or the decisional law of the commonwealth construing the term, would have adequately apprised defendant that the conduct in which he engaged could have subjected him to criminal sanctions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant, after being in hiding for many years following the commission of crimes by herself and her confederates, pleaded guilty to indictments for armed robbery and manslaughter. The defendant was granted leave to appeal from the portion of her sentence, instituted by the Superior Court, Suffolk County (Massachusetts), which placed a special condition on her probation that she not profit from the sale of her story to the news media.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant requested that the court vacate the special condition that she not profit from the sale of her story on the grounds (1) that it violated her right to free expression under the U.S. Const. amend I, because it imposed a prior restraint on content-based speech, (2) that it unconstitutionally placed her in jeopardy for the actions of third persons, and (3) that it was unconstitutionally vague. The court rejected the arguments. Although the condition implicated her constitutional rights, it only barred the her ability to profit from the sale of her story, not her right to speak on the matter. In addition, a probation condition that was reasonably related to a goal of the justice system, such as deterrence, was valid, if it was reasonable. The impact of this condition on the defendant's rights was negligible in terms of its deterrence value. On the second claim, the defendant was not at risk from third parties telling parts of her story, because the prohibition was merely against her profiting from other's using the story. Lastly, the court held that, although a probation condition was required to be clear, the one in question was clear, so the point lacked merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the probation condition placed on the defendant, prohibiting her from profiting from the sale of the story of her crimes and hiding to the media.</SPAN></P>

The charges were resolved with an entry of nolle prosequi by the state. Defendant sought to have the records of the case sealed. The district judge denied defendant's request on the grounds that defendant's reasons for sealing, specifically damage to his reputation and future employment prospects, were not sufficient to overcome the presumption of openness of criminal records. The court dismissed the district court's report of questions on the issue of sealing the record's because as a district court sitting before a non-jury criminal proceeding, the district court did not have authority under the version of Mass. R. Crim. P. 34 in effect at the time to report questions. However, the court decided to comment on the issues and found that the district court correctly dismissed defendant's petition because there was insufficient evidence of the reason for the nolle prosequi, an important factor to consider. The court also noted that the risk of damage to defendant's reputation and future prospects was more substantial than indicated by the district court.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 10 cl. 1 as it was applied to plaintiffs, state community college faculty, staff, and their unions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The unions challenged an employee furlough program instituted by the commonwealth to assist in reducing a large commonwealth deficit. The unions contended that the furlough program violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 largely on the basis that the program abrogated various collective bargaining agreements entered in December 1990. The superior court determined that the furlough provisions violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect;10 on their face, and the commonwealth's action was not justified under any circumstances. The court granted review and held that the matter required a determination on whether the furloughs were reasonable and necessary. The court held that the commonwealth's furloughs were not reasonable because the commonwealth could have foreseen the impending budget crisis when it entered into the union contracts in December 1990. The commonwealth's financial position had not worsened in the few months between the execution of the union contracts and the implementation of the furloughs in April 1991 and it was not reasonable to ignore the union contracts. The court did not address whether the action was necessary. The judgment of the superior court was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax provisions at issue allowed a domestic corporation to deduct from its taxable net worth for the purposes of the state corporate excise tax the value of its domestic subsidiaries and allowed foreign corporation to deduct the value of its foreign subsidiaries for the same purpose. The court found that the tax provisions violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The court concluded that the provisions facially discriminated against interstate commerce because the provision drew distinctions solely on the basis of the domicil of the subsidiary, and treated a domestic corporation more favorably if it chose to acquire a domestic subsidiary, rather than a foreign subsidiary. Furthermore, the scheme imposed a heavier burden on domestic corporations who own foreign subsidiaries than on domestic corporations who own domestic subsidiaries. The court also found that the elimination of double taxation, a legitimate state interest, did not justify the provisions because they only eliminated double taxation for domestic corporations that owned only domestic subsidiaries. The problem of double taxation persisted for multi-state corporate families.</SPAN></P>

The court found that when the Secretary determined that it was not feasible for the summaries to appear on voting machines, the preparation of separate sheets of paper containing the attorney general's various summaries and the furnishing of a sheet to each voter as he prepared to cast his vote by the use of such a machine fulfilled the basic purpose of having each voter capable of informing himself of the questions.</SPAN></P>

The challenged line item was a valid exercise by the legislature of its reserved power.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32A, &sect; 8 existed at the time the CBAs were made; the CBAs incorporated a mandate that the appropriation process determined the percentage of the commonwealth's contribution. Because the CBAs themselves necessarily contemplated changes in premium contributions through subsequent appropriation acts, there was no conflict between the line item and the CBAs.

The administrative judge ruled that the employee was only entitled to payment up to the effective date of the amendment. The board reversed the administrative judge and ruled that &sect; 8(2)(j) did not apply to claims arising out of injuries that occurred before the effective date. On appeal, the court reversed. As a procedural provision, &sect; 8(2)(j) applied to personal injuries irrespective of the date of their occurrence. Applying &sect; 8(2)(j) to claims based on injuries that arose before the effective date of the amendment raised no constitutional issue because an incarcerated employee had no vested right in benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant struck and killed the victim while the victim was attempting to push his disabled vehicle. Defendant claimed that he did not see disabled vehicle. The troopers on the scene testified that defendant was under the influence of alcohol because his breath had a strong odor of alcohol, his eyes were bloodshot and glassy, he was unsteady on his feet, and his speech was slurred. On appeal, the court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the indictments. At the close of the commonwealth's case, a rational trier of fact could have found defendant guilty; therefore, defendant's motions for required findings of not guilty were properly denied. No evidence was presented that defendant refused to submit to a blood alcohol test; however, the trial court's instruction under &sect;24(1)(e) tended to have the same affect as refusal evidence. Consequently, &sect; 24(1)(e)&nbsp;unconstitutionally compelled defendant to furnish evidence against himself. Defendant was entitled to a new trial because the jury instruction likely caused the jury to conclude that defendant refused to submit to the test and to impermissibly use that evidence against defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A town challenged jury verdicts in favor of beneficiaries in their negligence actions against the town. The question before the court was whether the amendment of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 258, &sect;10, by Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 258, &sect; 57, which added a statutory public duty rule providing governmental immunity, could constitutionally be retroactively applied. On appeal, the court reversed the jury verdicts. The court found that the beneficiaries' theories of liability depended upon the alleged failure of the police to prevent criminal conduct. The court also found that the state had an interest in protecting governmental entities from the expenditure of time, effort, and money in the defense of claims barred by the amendment and in protecting against recovery on such claims. The court also determined that although the beneficiaries' interests in the judgments on appeal were entitled to recognition as property rights, those interests were not as firmly established as rights of the kind that the court had protected against retroactive legislative abolition. The court further found that the beneficiaries continued to have claims against the drunk driver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court on its own initiative transferred the case from the Appeals Court (Massachusetts), where defendant challenged the stalking statute,&nbsp;Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's former wife obtained a restraining order that required the him to stay away from her residence, and to make no telephone calls to her. When he violated the terms of the order, he was arrested and subsequently found guilty of stalking, in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 43. The court agreed with defendant that the statute was unconstitutionally vague, requiring reversal of the stalking conviction. The statute announced a definition of &quot;harasses&quot; that could be fairly argued as requiring one to engage repeatedly in a pattern of conduct or series of acts over a period of time. Under this interpretation, one pattern or one series would not be enough. Although a single pattern of conduct or a single series of acts, combined with the other elements of the crime, was presumably intended to constitute the crime. That is not, however, stated in the statute with sufficient clarity to avoid the force of the defendant's claim of unconstitutional vagueness. None of defendant's arguments addressed his three convictions of violating a restraining order, for which he received concurrent sentences to run with the stalking conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the landlords violated &sect; 4(6), but vacated the judgment and remanded the case because the Commonwealth was to be given the opportunity to demonstrate a compelling interest in the application of the statute, in view of its denying the landlords a statutory exemption.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the exclusion of the organization was a form of sexual orientation discrimination in violation of the public accommodation discrimination law and further found that inconsistent explanations for excluding the organization and the lack of selection standards were pretextual. The court held: 1) the trial court's determination was not clearly erroneous because the plain language of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 272 &sect; 92A(8) established that the parade fell within the scope of the public accommodation law; 2) the parade organizers failed to established that the parade was for expressive purposes for First Amendment protection; and 3) the public accommodation law facially did not reach speech or expression protected by the First Amendment, it did not infringe on the parade organizers' rights, and it gave persons of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what was prohibited by the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A commercial office building owned by the trust and located in the town caught fire. The town's fire department reported to the scene and attempted to contain and extinguish the fire. The complaint alleged that the fire department was unable to contain the fire successfully because of an inadequate water supply and because of negligent firefighting tactics. The trustees argued that the public duty rule did not preclude their claims. The court affirmed the judgment for the town because the duty to provide an adequate supply of water for fighting fires, consistent with the general duty to provide fire protection, was a duty owed to the public at large, and the town's liability was precluded by the public duty rule. That a hydrant in a state of disrepair was in the vicinity of the trustees property was not sufficient to create a special duty. Common law precluded actions against municipalities for negligent firefighting.</SPAN></P>

The court held that this classification violated the equal protection provisions of the constitution of the commonwealth, in that it was not supported by any rational basis. On appeal, the court affirmed its judgment, holding that the provision was unconstitutional because it arbitrarily and without rational basis classified claimants based on whether they were proceeding with the assistance of an attorney. The court held that the amount of the fee bore no clear relation to the stated purpose of the fee but did not rule that the words were unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection or due process. The court subsequently granted defendant commissioner's emergency motion, which sought to enter a declaration that the phrases &quot;represented by counsel&quot; and &quot;equal to the average weekly wage in the commonwealth at the time of the appeal&quot; were unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Mass. Gen.

Boston, Mass., Code &sect; 17-13.6 (1985), a noise ordinance, provided that businesses that held entertainment licenses could not operate between 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m., with the exception of films that began before 12:30 p.m. and closed before 3:00 a.m. The city granted a local club a license on condition that it complied with the ordinance. On cross motions for summary judgment by the city and the club, the superior court upheld the ordinance as valid under both the state statute and the First Amendment. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision as to the state statute but reversed on the First Amendment analysis. The noise ordinance fulfilled a legitimate governmental purpose and was content neutral. However, the ordinance failed constitutional muster because its time, place, and manner restrictions were not narrowly tailored to fit its purpose. The city admitted that the ordinance adversely affected entertainment that did not produce the unwanted secondary effects of noise.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction, claiming that the trial court's failure to allow his motion to sever his trial from that of a co-defendant resulted in a denial of defendant's federal and state constitutional rights to present a full defense.

Noting that defendant's argument was in reality grounded on the trial court's limitation of his cross-examination of witnesses as to the duration of the police department's investigation of his co-defendant rather than on a failure to sever, the court ruled that the record did not support defendant's contention that exclusion of this evidence prevented him from arguing that he had been framed to preserve the case against the co-defendant, and that defendant was not deprived of exculpatory evidence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's motion for a new trial was granted by the superior court. The issue before the court was whether defendant could be awarded attorney's fees and costs of appeal after the commonwealth's application for leave to appeal was denied. The single justice of the superior court reasoned that a request to a single justice for leave to appeal did not constitute an appeal to an appellate court from a final order as required by Mass. R. Crim. P. 30(c)(8)(B). The single justice denied defendant's request for attorney's fees and costs. The court affirmed, holding that defendant had no basis for recovery of attorney's fees and costs. The court concluded that an award of attorney's fees and costs was not appropriate because there was no statute or rule providing for the payment of attorneys fees and costs to a defendant when a single justice denied the commonwealth's application for leave to appeal under Mass.

The trial court committed the inmate to a treatment center and denied his later petition for discharge.

The court considered the inmate's challenge to his commitment because its constitutional significance was not established until after the proceedings conducted under Mass. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from four armed robbery convictions entered in the trial court (Massachusetts), grounding his complaint in an allegedly illegal detention. The case was transferred on the court's own initiative to consider whether a district court judge could set bail in a defendant's absence and order him committed to a house of correction pending a postponed arraignment when medical necessity precluded his immediate appearance in court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for receiving a stolen motor vehicle, driving to endanger, and failing to stop for the police. Because defendant posed a danger to himself, the district court judge issued a mittimus ordering that he be committed to a house of correction pending appearance at his pretrial hearing that was postponed due to a staff psychologist's opinion that he was suicidal, and that he should be committed to the state hospital for a period of observation not to exceed 30 days. Defendant was arraigned following his release from the state hospital on charges for various armed robberies to which the police had connected him using the photographs and fingerprints taken at the house of correction.The court agreed that the district court judge's practice violated defendant's right to participate in his bail hearing and his right to a prompt initial court appearance. Consequently, defendant was illegally detained. There was no basis for dismissing the indictments or suppressing evidence as a remedy, as defendant failed to demonstrate prejudice to his case caused by the violation of his rights, and failed to show that there had been egregious misconduct by the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

Art. 101 specified that any challenge to the plan was to be filed within 10 days in the Supreme Judicial Court. The towns filed suit in the lower court, then filed again the next day in the proper court. The court held that the delay did not necessitate dismissing the suit, but it denied the request on the merits. The court held that the redistricting plan met the commonwealth's constitutional requirements and properly included the goals established under the Federal Voting Rights. It held that the towns had not presented a better plan that would effectuate the one person, one vote rule and the reapportionment requirements of the commonwealth's constitution. It held that its role was not to create a better redistricting plan, but to evaluate whether the plan as drafted met the federal and commonwealth constitutional requirements.

The court held that the ordinance's validity could be challenged by plaintiff as a purchaser of the land subject to the restriction. The court remanded to the trial court for an evaluation of the applicable standards for determining whether there had been a regulatory taking of property.

The Commissioner of Revenue asserted that such future interest income was not exempt from taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sold real estate they owned in Massachusetts, structuring the sale as an &quot;installment sale&quot; of property under 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 453(b) for federal income tax purposes while electing, for Massachusetts tax purposes, to report and pay the entire tax on the gain in their 1982 nonresident income tax returns, as provided by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 62, &sect; 63(e) (1992). The commissioner contended that the interest income was not exempt from taxation for 1983-1986, and the court, in reversing the board, agreed. In so holding, the court reasoned that it was illogical to interpret the ambiguous language in &sect; 63(e) as reaching out to exempt interest income from taxation for the years in question because the taxpayers had elected to pay state tax on the entire gain on the transaction in the year of the sale. Further, the court rejected the nonresident taxpayers' argument that such taxation was unconstitutional, finding that because the taxpayers had a mortgage on Massachusetts real estate to secure the debt owed to them by the purchasers, the benefit and protection that the law of Massachusetts extended to them provided sufficient basis for imposing the tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a codicil to the decedent's will, he left money to the inhabitants of the city, provided the trust was used to grant loans to young married persons setting up business.

Subsequently, the legislature enacted 1958 Mass. Acts ch. 596, to pay the portion of the trust bequeathed to the city to a foundation, and the trust would not terminate unless a decree of the supreme judicial court authorized the termination. The foundation brought an interpleader action for termination of the trust under 1958 Mass. Acts ch. 596 because there were no loan recipients. The trial court declined to exercise its power to terminate the trust. On review, the court held that the trust term expired on the date of the second hundred years, and required immediate distribution of the corpus of the trust to the foundation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, two defendants arrested without warrants and the Committee for Public Counsel Services, petitioned the court pursuant to Mass. Gen.

Defendant justices opposed the petition and sought to dismiss the Committee as an improper party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court examined the history of the protections contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and concluded that the only element bearing on the reasonableness of the delay between a competed arrest and a judicial determination of probable cause was the time reasonably necessary to reach a magistrate. The court agreed with plaintiffs that, under normal circumstances, a 24-hour limit fairly reflected the required time, and noted that most federal cases agreed with that assessment. The court held that where that time limit was exceeded, the police must bear the burden of demonstrating that an extraordinary circumstance caused the delay. The court held that the probable cause determination must be made by a neutral and detached magistrate, could be made verbally in an ex parte proceeding as long as the art. 14 &quot;oath&quot; or &quot;affirmation requirement was made, and that defendants were not entitled to assistance of counsel during the probable cause hearing. The case therefore remanded the case for the entry of a declaratory judgment reflecting its opinion.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 273, &sect; 1 barred their prosecution because they were following the tenets of their Christian Science faith in refusing to get medical care for their son's peritonitis, which he died from. In conjunction with this argument, defendants alleged that given the provision and an opinion of the Massachusetts Attorney General on its effect, they did not receive fair warning that they could be charged with involuntary manslaughter. The court found that defendants were subject to a common law duty to provide for the care of their children, the breach of which could form the basis for an involuntary manslaughter charge. It found that the spiritual treatment provision did not foreclose an involuntary manslaughter charge and that the involuntary manslaughter statute gave fair warning to defendants. However, whether the Attorney General's opinion could have led defendants to believe that they did not need to obtain medical treatment for their son was a question of fact that should have been presented to the jury, and the failure to do so could have led to a miscarriage of justice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action by plaintiff corporation, defendant board of health (board) appealed an order of the Superior Court Department, Norfolk (Massachusetts), which granted the corporation's motion for relief from judgment and entered a new judgment in the corporation's favor, claiming that 23 Stat. 18 (1992), which amended Mass.

Laws ch. 111, &sect; 150B applied to the corporation and that to continue operations, it had to apply for and receive a site assignment from the board. The legislature then amended &sect; 150B by providing, in 23 Stat. 18 (1992) (the amendment), that Mass. Gen.

The trial court granted the corporation's motion for relief from the judgment and a stay of further proceedings before the board. The board appealed, arguing that the amendment was unconstitutional. After granting the board's application for direct appellate review, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the legislature properly amended the statute to accomplish what it originally intended. Further, the amendment was clearly enacted in response to the court's original judgment to exclude hazardous waste facilities such as that of the corporation. The court also ruled that the amendment did not violate the Home Rule Amendment of the state constitution because it concerned matters of state or general concern, even though it had a special effect on one town.</SPAN></P>

In this case, however, the court found that the commonwealth was not currently fulfilling its constitutional duty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant's appeal was heard, the underlying criminal charges against him were dismissed and he was free. The court found that the appeal raised important issues that were likely to arise again, but were unlikely to be reviewed before becoming moot. The court therefore held that it was appropriate to reach the merits of the issues raised despite the absence of a live controversy. The full supreme court held that there was no requirement that the government institute any additional criminal proceeding as a prerequisite to the revocation of bail on the basis of alleged offenses committed while defendant was released on bail or personal recognizance. The court further held that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 58 gave defendants the right to de novo review of district court bail determinations, including subsequent modifications or revisions, by the superior court. However, the court held that &sect; 58 was not intended to provide similar de novo review by the superior court of bail revocation orders, reasoning that review of a bail revocation hearing was more in the nature of an appeal than a de novo determination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, trucking association and interstate trucking companies, brought a class action against the commonwealth, and alleged that certain annual fuel license fees, and a hazardous waste fee, were assessed by the commonwealth in a manner that violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court granted the trucking association's application for direct appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth assessed a &quot;User of Special Fuels License,&quot; that was required for each vehicle operated in Massachusetts which used diesel or other non-gasoline fuels, Mass.

Gen. Laws ch. 21C, &sect; 7, para. 5 (1990). On appeal, the court applied the internal consistency test, which required that a state tax that applied to interstate business be of a kind that, if applied by every jurisdiction, there would be no impermissible interference with free trade. Here, the court held that each of the fees failed the test, and each was in violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The fees discriminated against out-of-state truckers by subjecting them to a higher charge per mile traveled in Massachusetts, and did not fairly approximate the value of any benefit received or a cost actually incurred in the commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action for declaratory and injunctive relief, plaintiff spouse challenged the constitutionality of the fee provisions of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 152, &sect; 11A in a case involving defendant Commissioner of the Department of Industrial Accidents. The challenge came after plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction was denied in a workers' compensation case brought on behalf of plaintiff's deceased husband. The court ordered declaratory judgment and held that the challenged portions violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights amend. art. 11. The court was unable to ascertain any rational basis for the imposition of a filing fee only on litigants proceeding with the assistance of counsel and found that the relationship of the presently challenged classification to any goal was so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational. The classification merely penalized claimants who chose to engage counsel and singled out these claimants for &quot;arbitrary and capricious&quot; treatment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found defendant responsible for the violation, and the judgment was affirmed by the district and appellate courts. On further review, the court held that a statute could be void for vagueness if it impermissibly delegated basic policy matters to policemen, judges or juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis. The court held that the violation was a civil matter for which the maximum penalty was the payment of a fine; however, payment of the fine operated as a conviction for purposes of driver registry and insurance. The court held that the option to issue a warning or a citation was not impermissibly vague and that it was proper for police to have some disruption in whether or not to issue a citation.

Gen. Laws. ch. 94A, &sect;&sect; 10-12. The order set forth a plan designed to boost the amount of money local dairy farmers, the producers, received for milk above and beyond that required by a federal program. The order required milk dealers to submit monthly reports and to contribute to a state equalization fund. The commissioner distributed the fund to producers in proportion to the milk produced in the commonwealth during the preceding month. The milk dealers failed to comply with the pricing order, and the commissioner revoked their milk dealers' licenses. The milk dealers filed suit, arguing that the pricing order violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, because the order denied out-of-state milk producers the opportunity to compete with in-state milk producers because of the commonwealth's premium. On appeal, the court disagreed, holding that the order was constitutional because it had a merely incidental burden on interstate commerce. The court then remanded the case for further action.</SPAN></P>

The State argued that the statute did not create a preventative statutory scheme. The court determined that the statute infringed on defendant's interest in freedom from detention. The amendment essentially granted a judicial officer unbridled discretion to determine whether an arrested individual was dangerous.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge had ruled that the amendment, apart from the retroactive funding portion, did not effect a taking of any private property, did not violate any constitutional requirement concerning abandoned property, and was a proper exercise of legislative power establishing that refund values belong to consumers until they escheated to the state. However, the retroactive funding provision in 1989 Mass. Acts ch. 653, &sect; 237 effected an unconstitutional retroactive taking of the property as to refund values collected during the three months prior to the amendment's effective date, although the provision was severable. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding no violation of the takings clause by conferring the right to the deposits on the consumer and, once abandoned, on the state, as rights created under the original bottle bill did not translate into a similar set of rights under the amended bill. The court agreed that the retroactive funding provision unconstitutionally directed the taking of the private property without compensation; however, as it was severable from the rest of the amendment, the remainder of the amendment's abandoned property scheme was not improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, juveniles accused of murder charges, filed a motion seeking to dismiss the indictments on the ground that the new Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juveniles, who were both charged in connection with two murders, moved to dismiss the indictments on the ground that the new Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, &sect; 61 (1990), under which they were transferred for trial as adults, violated state and federal constitutional provisions. The juveniles also argued that the Juvenile Court judge erred in excluding their expert psychiatric testimony as a sanction for failure to cooperate in court-ordered examinations. Concluding that a serious issue as to the constitutional validity of the statute was raised, the trial court certified the motions to an appeals court. The state's highest court transferred the case on its own initiative. Upon review, the state's highest court concluded that the statute was constitutional because the legislative distinction between charges of delinquency by reason of murder and delinquency by reason of other crimes was a rational one. However, the state's highest court held that the issue of admission of expert psychiatric evidence must be reconsidered because while the self-incrimination privilege applied, the juveniles could be ordered to submit to an exam if they chose to offer expert psychiatric evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty, based on a claim that Mass.

On appeal, the court found no error in the finding that the distance between defendant's house and a school was less than the proscribed distance of 1,000 feet. As to defendant's probable cause argument, the court found that affidavits based on information from confidential informants were required by Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 14 to inform a magistrate of the underlying circumstances of an informant's basis of knowledge and his or her reliability or veracity. The court found that the affidavit supporting the warrant in question satisfied both prongs of the test. The informants' observations satisfied the basis of knowledge test, and independent police corroboration of the informants' information satisfied the veracity test. Further, the informants' statements were a declaration against their penal interests and established credibility.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Rhode Island grand jury issued two subpoenas duces tecum to an accountant of the investigated person. The accountant was willing to deliver the documents requested by the grand jury in Rhode Island, but the investigated person objected. The motion judge of the trial court denied the investigated person's motions to quash the subpoena or stay the order of the trial court directing the accountant to provide the documents. One justice of the court of appeals stayed the execution of the trial court's order. The court vacated the appeals court stay and affirmed the trial court's order directing production by the accountant. The court found that the investigated person lacked standing to intervene to move to quash the subpoena served on his accountant--only the accountant could challenge the subpoena. The court also concluded that in determining the materiality and necessity of a witness consistent with the Uniform Law to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from Without a State in Criminal Proceedings, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 233, &sect;&sect; 13A-13D (1990), a Massachusetts court could rely on another state's certificate statement that an in-state witness was material.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners sought an award of damages against defendant city, claiming that defendant's unlawful restriction on their right to sell individual condominium units was unconstitutional and deprived them, to their financial detriment, of the right to sell individual units for over two years. The trial court rejected defendant's argument that plaintiffs were barred by an earlier judgment from presenting their constitutionally-based claim for damages, but agreed with defendant that its conduct did not amount to a taking or to a denial of due process or equal protection of the laws. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that the challenged regulation did not interfere with plaintiffs' investment-based expectations. Plaintiffs acquired the property when the regulation was already in effect. The price that they paid for the property should have reflected any adverse impact the regulation had on the fair market value of the property. The fact that plaintiffs could not make immediate optimum use of their property and thus were unable to sell the units at prices higher than those at which they could sell them after the regulation was invalidated did not constitute a taking.</SPAN></P>

There was no person present to drive away the vehicle except a passenger, who had no valid driver's license. The court held that the inclusion of the bag containing the cocaine, which was located in the trunk, in the inventory search was permissible because the bag was located in an accessible storage area. The court further held that U.S. Const. amend. IV and Mass. Const.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A suit was commenced against the officer and others for malicious prosecution and damages were assessed. The officer was entitled to indemnification for attorneys' fees arising out of the federal action against him. The question was whether attorneys' fees incurred to enforce a statutory right of indemnification were fees for which the legislature intended people like the officer to be indemnified. The court held that the officer's legal fees and expenses arose out of the federal suit within the intent of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258, &sect; 13 (1990 ed.), and, therefore, he should have been indemnified for legal fees and expenses he incurred in order that he be made whole. By accepting &sect; 13, the town agreed to pay the judgment and costs of defense. It was thus required to pay for the consequences of its failure to do so. The court adopted a rule that encouraged municipalities with a duty to indemnify to do so promptly. The rule attempted to assure that all municipal officers protected by &sect; 13 would be treated equally. The order that denied counsel fees was vacated and the case was remanded to the lower court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners had commenced administrative proceedings that sought permission to erect protective barriers to have prevented erosion of their properties.

The court reversed the judgment on the taking claim and remanded the case for further proceedings. In all other respects the judgment was affirmed. The court concluded that the complaint in one respect stated a claim of a regulatory taking that was sufficient to have survived a motion to dismiss. The property owners' claims did not fail in all respects simply because the administrative process was not completed before the properties were made worthless. The property owners' claim that if there had been no improper delays in the agency proceedings, their property would not have been damaged as a result, and the court determined that that claim was adequately alleged in the generality of the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1991, the Massachusetts legislature passed legislation that transferred revenues that were credited to the highway fund to the general fund to offset a deficit. A portion of the general fund revenues had been spent on transportation related purposes. The taxpayers challenged the transaction on the grounds that it violated the Massachusetts Constitution, specifically that revenue allocated to the highway fund could not be used for items delineated in the general fund. The court held that the transfer of funds did not violate Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 78, when art. 78 only required that the revenues generated from vehicle and license fees be spent on transportation related purposes. It did not matter under art. 78 where the art. 78 revenues were designated. The court held that there was no constitutional limitation on the legislature to amend a prior act of appropriation. The court held that the categorization of certain highway fund revenues as &quot;undesignated&quot; and thus available for transfer was appropriate.

However, the court reversed the conviction for murder in the first degree and remanded the cause for a new trial. In pertinent part, the court held that defendant's argument in a footnote that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of unlawful possession of a firearm was deemed waived because arguments relegated to a footnote did not rise to the level of appellate argument. Nevertheless, on a review of the issue, the court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to warrant the conviction. On the other hand, the court held that the trial court erred by allowing the state to introduce evidence of defendant's refusal to have his hands swabbed. The court held that although the issue was not clearly raised at trial, the error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice on the murder conviction. The court held that the refusal of evidence should not have been admitted because its use violated defendant's privilege against self-incrimination secured by Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 12.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was charged with possession of marihuana with intent to distribute, &sect; 32C, and possession of marihuana with intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of a school, &sect; 32J, he was convicted in the primary session on the &sect; 32C offense and sought a jury trial on the &sect; 32J offense. Due to a procedural error, he was retried on both offenses in the jury session and found guilty. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed the &sect; 32J conviction, but reversed the &sect; 32C conviction, holding that because defendant did not appeal the &sect; 32C conviction from the primary session, that conviction stood and had to be reinstated. Double jeopardy did not apply because the retrial was of no legal significance with respect to the de novo trial of the &sect; 32J offense. Section 32J was not vague because it did not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Further, the statute was not overbroad because it did not prohibit constitutionally protected conduct. Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was without merit because counsel's concession of the possession charge was a tactical decision to press the defense that there was no intent to distribute.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the prohibition of a nighttime search was intended as a safeguard against abusive, arbitrary action on the part of the police. The procedural letter and not the substantive spirit of the law was violated. The court further determined that suppression would not have deterred future police misconduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The AFDC recipients initiated an action against the commissioner seeking injunctive and declaratory relief on the basis that 1990 Mass. Acts ch. 150, &sect; 58 and Mass. Regs. Code tit. 106 &sect; 304.305(b) violated federal laws and denied them equal protection. They alleged that the requirement to add non-siblings residing with a nonparent to the &quot;assistance unit&quot; of a grantee relative deprived them of the AFDC grant they would receive as an independent unit. The trial court granted partial summary judgment to the commissioner and the AFDC recipients appealed, asserting that the state scheme was preempted by federal laws and was unconstitutional. The court affirmed, ruling that because the federal AFDC statutory scheme envisioned state participation in implementing the program, the AFDC recipients' preemption argument failed. Further, they had not presented any clear and unambiguous statement preempting 1990 Mass. Acts ch. 150, &sect; 58. The court discerned no congressional intent prohibiting the state from consolidating assistance units in the manner established by &sect; 58. It held that neither &sect; 58 nor the regulation violated equal protection provisions of federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The court found that 1) the absence of an explicit allegation concerning the defendants' state of mind in the inmates allegation of a violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 was not fatal to the complaint, 2) the conclusion that the inmates were prevailing parties because the law suit was a necessary and important factor in achieving certain improvements at the house of correction was not clearly erroneous, 3) the justice did not err in rejecting the defendants' various objections to the allowance of attorneys' fees, and 4) the justice did not abuse his discretion in reducing the fee award in the absence of the contemporaneous time records.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city park in question had approximately six miles of roadways. The park roads were not public ways, but the public had a right of access to them. The commission adopted a regulation to prohibit the use of motorized cycles in city parks. The regulation prohibited the use of all two-, three-, and four-wheeled motorized cycles, specifically including motorcycles. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which entered judgment in favor of the commission. The appellate court had affirmed the trial court. The case was remanded to the trial court for entry of declaratory and injunctive relief. The court held that the regulation conflicted with the statutory right to operate motor vehicles on the ways of the commonwealth, as established by the legislature in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90. The commission was not allowed to adopt a regulation that conflicted with state law. The commission was a municipal department of the city, and municipalities were not able to adopt by-laws or ordinances that were inconsistent with state law. Thus, the regulation was invalid.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the town's power to control rents because a statement of a serious public emergency was contained in 1985 Mass. Acts 703, so that there was no need for the town to adopt a second statement of a serious public emergency. Further, there was no requirement in 1985 Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Senate requested that the court determine whether a proposed statute, which would have permitted a defendant's failure or refusal to submit to a chemical test or analysis of his breath to be admissible as evidence in a criminal proceeding, would have violated the self-incrimination clause, Mass.

In answering in the affirmative, the court found that although some have said that the act of refusal was not a self-accusation, in the court's view it was simply wrong to conclude that refusal evidence used in the manner proposed was not evidence furnished by the accused. Therefore, such refusal evidence was both compelled and furnished evidence against oneself. The proposed statute therefore would have violated the privilege against self-incrimination of Mass. Const.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the denial of the employee's unemployment benefits and the later affirmation of the denial of benefits, the employee appealed. The court noted that the findings and the decision of the board that the employee's entitlement to benefits depended on his meeting the minimum wage requirement of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151A, &sect; 24(a). The employee argued that the decision was based on an error of law and that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151A, &sect; 1 was ambiguous. He further argued that the department's interpretation violated equal protection principles. Affirming the district court's judgment, the court held that the legislature's intent was to limit eligibility for unemployment compensation by requiring a minimum level of earnings as a prerequisite. The employee's total earnings, therefore, made him ineligible for unemployment compensation. The court further noted that the statute was not unconstitutional because the Legislature had a interest in providing unemployment benefits only for those working a certain predetermined minimum term. State legislatures were presumed to have acted within their constitutional power despite the fact that their laws resulted in some inequality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department maintained that its statutory grant of authority pursuant to Mass. Gen.

The court found that the statute was intended to promote access to healthcare and gave complex formulas for determining the liability of the pool to the hospital and vice versa. The court affirmed and found that the department's regulations adopted a higher than average level of performance as an incentive for hospitals to undertake reasonable collection efforts, but that Mass. Regs. Code tit. 117, &sect; 2.04(4)(d) (1989) impermissibly established criteria that rewrote the state's policies respecting the overall statutory scheme for reimbursement. The court noted that no deference was due when an agency's interpretation of a statute was incorrect, and found that the legislative history supported the hospitals' view that the statute required only that the hospital make a reasonable effort to collect payment.</SPAN></P>

The court found that while the stock interests and money market funds in the various accounts were the owner's property in Illinois, because that was their state of domicile, the owners had no property rights in Massachusetts, therefore there was nothing for defendant to levy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated action, plaintiff license holder appealed the order of the Superior Court (Massachusetts), which affirmed the suspension of its liquor license by defendant, alcoholic beverages control commission (commission). The commission appealed the decision of a single justice of the court staying the enforcement of the suspension pending resolution of the license holder's appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The liquor licensing board (board) heard charges against the license holder for violations of the liquor licensing law. Some of the violations stemmed from assaults on customers by an employee, which resulted in criminal charges against the employee. The board voted to revoke the license. The commission reduced the penalty to a 95-day suspension. The license holder appealed, but the trial court affirmed the commission's decision. The license holder appealed again and sought a stay pending the appeal. A single justice allowed the stay, and the commission appealed the order. After consolidating the appeals, the court affirmed both judgments and held that there was no evidence on the record to support the license holder's contention that it could not go forward in the administrative proceeding prior to the conclusion of the criminal charges pending against its employee. The license holder did not have standing to assert the employee's privilege against self-incrimination, and there was no violation of the license holder's due process rights. The commission's determinations were based on substantial evidence. The justice did not err in granting the stay pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's affirmance of the commission's suspension of the license holder's liquor license.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">House Bill No. 4000 proposed term limitations on state elected officials. The senate asked the court whether the bill was inconsistent with Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 9, and Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights amend. art. 48, &sect; 2. The court found that it was not. Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 9 provided that all inhabitants of the commonwealth, having such qualifications as they shall establish by their frame of government, have an equal right to elect officers, and to be elected, for public employment. The court found that the original draft contained a term limitation for the office of governor and that the ultimate vote against term limits had more to do with political compromises than with concern with rights provided by Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 9. Therefore, the court held that House Bill No. 4000 was not inconsistent with the rights afforded by Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 9 and was therefore not excluded from the initiative process by Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights amend. art. 48, &sect; 2, which precluded the use of the initiative procedure to enact constitutional amendments inconsistent with the Declaration of Rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chiropractor alleged that the seven-member board lacked jurisdiction because it was not properly constituted, that one board member who participated in the decision should have recused himself, and that the decision rendered was not supported by substantial evidence. The court treated the jurisdictional challenge as a challenge to the validity of the board's action because it did not have two physician members as required by state law. The court found that, when the decision in the case at bar was issued, the law had been amended to eliminate the requirement in question. The court also held that, while due process did not require a professional disciplinary board member to recuse himself based upon his relationship with the insurance company that initiated the complaint, recusal might have been better practice. The court further held that its review of the record indicated that there was substantial evidence that the chiropractor engaged in overutilization of practice, assessed improper charges, and failed to provide a proper rationale for the use of certain procedures. The court, therefore, affirmed the decision suspending the chiropractor's license.</SPAN></P>

Stat. 138, the control of a penal institution was transferred from the city of Boston to the county sheriff.

The employees claimed that the transfer violated the Home Rule Amendment, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 7, &sect; 7L. The court entered judgment in favor of the county sheriff. The court held: (1) the Home Rule Amendment did not preclude the state legislature from acting on matters state, regional, or general concern; (2) the transfer legislation predominately concerned state, regional, and general matters; (3) while the legislation had some special effect on Boston's penal institutions department, the effect neither diminished the Home Rule Amendment's broader purpose or made the Home Rule Amendment applicable; and (4) the Home Rule Amendment did not apply because the legislation provided for funds for the expansion of county correctional facilities and not funds for the payment of expenses of the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder when he was 16. He admitted to charges of delinquency and was committed to the Department. The Department ordered defendant's commitment extended based on 1990 Mass. Acts ch. 267, &sect;&sect; 6-9, which amended Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 120, &sect;&sect; 16-19. The trial court denied the Commonwealth and Department's petition for relief and discharged defendant. The court held that the change effectuated by 1990 Mass. Acts ch. 267, &sect; 7 could not lawfully be applied to reduce the amount of proof necessary to extend defendant's commitment to the Department. The amendment increased the punishment beyond that which could have been imposed at the time of the offense. 1990 Mass. Acts ch. 267, &sect; 9, which amended Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 120, &sect; 19 by increasing the time period of an extension order to age 21, became an ex post facto law because it was retrospective and more burdensome to defendant.

Gen. Laws ch.. 94C &sect; 32E (1988) and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265 &sect; 13D (1990). The court transferred the appeal sua sponte.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his trial on narcotics and assault charges, defendant claimed that the trial judge's restrictions on standby counsel's trial participation were an abuse of discretion that violated his right to a fair trial and to due process. Defendant argued that even though he chose to represent himself, he had a constitutional right to some level of assistance from counsel. The court disagreed, finding that (1) the appointment of standby counsel was within the broad discretion of the trial judge; (2) the trial judge's discretion to appoint or deny the appointment of standby counsel included the discretion to appoint counsel with any reasonable limitations; (3) the strict limitations on counsel's ability to prompt defendant to object, to ask certain questions, or to talk at sidebars were not unreasonable; and (4) the trial judge did not abuse his discretion, nor were defendant's constitutional rights violated by the restrictions. The court held that defendant's sentence was neither illegal nor unconstitutional because it fell within the range permitted by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C &sect; 32E(b)(2) (1988), and there was no evidence that the sentence included punishment for defendant's contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the course of a dispositional hearing on a child in need of services proceeding, the juvenile court declared unconstitutional a school committee policy expelling any high school student bringing a weapon onto school premises.

The court remanded the case to a single justice of the juvenile court with instructions that a judgment be entered directing the juvenile court to vacate the portions of the order that referred to plaintiffs. The court held that: (1) the language of Mass. Gen.

The trial court awarded judgment in favor of plaintiff, terminating the lease, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed holding that the trial court properly determined that the lease could be terminated because an occupant of the unit used the apartment for unlawful purposes. The court held that U.S. Const. amend. V did not apply where the criminal charges were dismissed due to a lack of evidence because it did not purport to resolve the question of her guilt or innocence. The court concluded that the evidence was properly not suppressed because management was authorized to be there when it provided two written notices before the 48-hour deadline to inform defendant of the scheduled extermination, and where the lease allowed management entry without notice for emergency purposes. The court concluded that the sawed-off shotgun and drugs were left in the apartment in plain view; therefore, defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy in these items was substantially diminished.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the fact that the expert's qualifications were previously laid out, and the lower court allowed the expert's testimony after an objection, clearly implied a determination as to the witness' qualifications; (2) once the lower court had made a preliminary finding as to the expert's qualifications, it was the jury's function to determine the credibility of the expert's testimony; (3) testimony as to the decrease in damage projections due to taxes did not seriously bring the subject of taxes to the jury's attention; (4) the legislature expressly intended the loss of consortium statute to apply retroactively; and (5) retroactive application did not violate the drivers' due process rights because retroactive application was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court reported the case to the appeals court, the court on its own initiative transferred the case to determine if &sect; 90 was constitutional. The court was asked to decide whether &sect;90 imposed a discretionary and unconstitutional graduated tax on state employees and whether it effected a governmental taking of the employee's property without reasonable compensation in violation of Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 10. The court determined that &sect;90 did not impose a tax on state employees because it did not raise revenue for the state, but was a decrease in expenditures of the state. The court determined that the law did not result in a taking of her property, because the employee had no employment contract for any definite period of time.

A medical malpractice tribunal (tribunal), convened to review the wife's offer of proof. The tribunal consisted of a physician, an attorney, and a judge of the Superior Court Department (Massachusetts). The attorney and the physician found for each doctor.

Less than twenty-four hours before his death, the doctors obtained a surgical consultation, which recommended an exploratory laparotomy after the decedent's condition was stabilized. The superior court reversed the medical malpractice tribunal's decision and held that the offer of proof was sufficient. The court affirmed, holding that the two panel members erred in deciding that the wife's offer of proof in regard to the three doctors was not sufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry. The wife's offer of proof alleged that the doctors failed to diagnose or treat the hernia, that their treatment of husband fell below the requisite standard of care, and that husband's death was the result.</SPAN></P>

There was also evidence that defendant had attempted suicide and had demonstrated sexual aggression and manipulative behavior.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, municipalities and insurer, instituted an action in the Superior Court Department (Massachusetts). At issue was whether statutes mandating the inclusion of certain benefits in all health insurance plans sold in the state violated Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights amend. art. 115. Defendant attorney general asserted counterclaims for enforcement. The trial court granted a motion for a report of the case and direct review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipalities purchased group health insurance plans for their employees. The municipalities and insurer sought a declaration that art. 115 permitted them to exclude the following statutorily mandated benefits from their contracts with the insurer: PAP smears and mammography, 1987 Mass. Acts ch. 363; preventive and primary care services for children, 1988 Mass. Acts ch. 23, &sect;&sect; 48, 52, 60; lead poison screening for children, 1987 Mass. Acts ch. 773; nonprescription enteral formulas for Chrohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, 1987 Mass. Acts ch. 683; diagnosis and treatment of infertility, 1987 Mass. Acts ch. 394; and chiropractic services, 1987 Mass. Acts ch. 711. The court held that art. 115 did not preclude enforcement of the statutes. Article 115 did not limit the legislature's ability to enact laws for the general welfare and generally applicable insurance regulations were not the type of regulation of municipal employment contemplated by the article. The municipalities' provision of group health insurance was voluntary and they accepted the obligation to purchase plans that were subject to generally applicable regulations that might cause the premiums to rise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared that the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights did not render ineffective the statutes challenged by the municipalities and insurer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought review of an order of the trial court (Massachusetts), which entered judgment for defendant Rent Control Board of Cambridge. Plaintiffs brought suit pursuant to the judicial review provision of the Cambridge Rent Control Authorizing Act, 1976 Mass. Acts ch. 36, &sect; 10. They contended that a Board regulation that provided different methods of calculating a rate of returns for large and small landlords was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs contended that a regulation allowing a higher interest rate for small-scale landlords than for large-scale landlords violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. They contended that the challenged rule was a rate action, which required a higher level of scrutiny. On appeal, the court held that the Board action was a regulation and that it passed constitutional muster because it was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose. Because the board action was of sufficiently general application, it came within the definition of regulation found in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 30A, &sect; 1 (1988 ed.). It enjoyed a presumption of validity equal to that of a statute. The asserted purpose of the regulation, to ensure quality rental housing at an affordable price, tracked the purpose of the enabling Act. The distinction between large-scale and small-scale landlords was rational because large-scale landlords had less expensive opportunities for financing and therefore could make a profit at the lower interest rate. Because the distinction was related to a legitimate state purpose, assuring affordable housing, the regulation was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for the Board in plaintiffs' action to declare a Board adopted regulation to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on information from informants who provided information regarding defendant's trafficking in narcotics and who made supervised purchases from defendant, the police submitted affidavits for a warrant authorizing a wiretap of his telephone. They also obtained a warrant to search his safety deposit boxes. Defendant sought to suppress the evidence. The court found that the explanation in the affidavit that the informants were unwilling to testify for fear of reprisal, the difficulty of visual surveillance, the lack of information obtained from his telephone record, and the probability that the search of his home would be fruitless, supported the reasonableness of the use of electronic means of surveillance techniques. The affidavit furnished sufficient information to show a reasonable likelihood that traditional investigative techniques either failed or would have failed, if attempted, in providing the police with information regarding the defendant's drug-trafficking activities. The affidavit for a warrant to search the safety deposit properly concluded that there was probable cause to believe that the safety deposit box contained evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission of Martha's Vineyard had issued a decision that restricted the construction of a guest house on the lot of the property owners in Edgartown. The property owners then filed a complaint in the trial court challenging the commission's decision, which the trial court affirmed in favor of the commission. On appeal by the property owners, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court found the commission had lacked jurisdiction under its enabling statute, 1977 Mass. Acts ch. 831, to review a proposed building on the property owners' vacant lot. Specifically, the court found the commission's regulation allowing cross-town referrals was invalid. The commission's enabling statute permitted only the permitting agency in the town where a project was located to refer that project to the commission for review as a development of regional impact. The court concluded that the commission lacked jurisdiction to review the application because it was not referred by Edgartown.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 119, &sect; 65 (1990) applied to the juveniles, who were charged with delinquency by reason of murder, aggravated rape, and armed robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Admitting the public to the proceedings was procedural, not a change in the juveniles' substantive rights. The court opined that increasing the punishment imposed beyond what could have been imposed would be ex post facto, but opening the proceedings to the public and possibly stigmatizing the juveniles was not punishment in a constitutional sense. The court held that it violated the juveniles' constitutional rights to single them out for treatment different from those who were charged with delinquency by reason of a crime other than murder. The court noted that juveniles did not have a fundamental, due process right to have the public excluded from a transfer hearing, and juveniles charged with murder were not a suspect class for whom a heightened test of the constitutionality of legislation applied; therefore, equal protection principles required only that the amendment was a rational means to serve a legitimate end. The court opined that the legislature had to balance the juveniles' interests and the juvenile justice system against the public's interest in being able to determine whether a decision to transfer a juvenile to adult jurisdiction was lawfully and soundly made.</SPAN></P>

The Commission made detailed findings after holding hearings and taking testimony and the court found the Commission's findings supported in their entirety. The court found the judge violated four canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct.

The court held (1) the statutes were exclusive remedies for the driver, (2) the statutes applied because the term &quot;defects&quot; under the statutes is defined in Mass. Gen.

The court stated that a motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 13 was not appealable by defendant until after trial. Further, the court stated that Mass. Gen.

The test states that defendant had to demonstrate both a substantial claim of a violation of his substantive rights and irremediable error, such that he could not be placed in status quo in the regular course of appeal. The court stated that defendant's argument that the grand jury lacked neutrality was without merit because there was nothing in the record that in any way impugned the neutrality of the grand jurors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Jesuits renovated a church, and the commission approved landmark designation for portions of the church's interior. The designation restricted permanent alteration of certain areas of the church. The Jesuits filed a complaint against the commission, contending that the designation violated the free exercise clause of the U.S. Const. amend. I. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Jesuits. The court affirmed, and held that the designation of the church interior as a landmark violated Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. II. Article II protected the right to freely to design interior spaces for religious worship, thus barring the government from regulating changes in such places, provided that no public safety question was presented. The landmark designation of the church interior unconstitutionally restrained religious worship. The conduct the commission attempted to regulate, renovation of the church interior, neither disturbed the public peace nor obstructed the religious worship of nonmembers of the church. Thus, the designation was unconstitutional under art. II.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed based on various contentions. The court found that defendant did not present any evidence during the motion hearing which established that the method of operation of both crimes was similar to warrant admission of other person's involvement. The trial judge did not err in denying defendant investigatory access to the victim of the second assault because he had access to police report. The court held that the two incidents of harassment when combined with the more serious harassment of another woman, was relevant evidence in showing that defendant may have been sexually frustrated. Further, there was sufficient evidence for a rational jury to infer that defendant attempted, but ultimately failed, to penetrate the victim and that defendant based on the cumulative evidence was guilty of first degree murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence before the grand jury showed that witnesses saw a man fitting defendant's description near the scene before he sexually assaulted the victim.

The superior court held defendant in contempt for refusing to appear in the lineup. On appeal, the court affirmed the superior court's order of contempt and ruled that the order did not violate defendant's constitutional rights. The court ruled that in order to direct a person to appear in a lineup, the superior court had to determine whether there was &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; that the person subject to the order committed the crime under grand jury investigation. The court determined that the standard satisfied art. 14's requirement that a search and seizure had to be reasonable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was serving time for assault and battery using a dangerous weapon and was to become eligible for parole in August 1986. In March 1986, the superintendent sought a psychiatric evaluation under &sect; 6 in order to determine defendant was a sexually dangerous person. After a single examiner found that he was sexually dangerous, the Commonwealth petitioned the lower court to determine that defendant should be committed for treatment under &sect; 6. While denying defendant's motions to dismiss, the trial court ultimately ruled that the Commonwealth had not complied with requirements under &sect; 6, and it ordered the process to begin again. Defendant again moved to dismiss, and his motion was again denied. He appealed both denials, but the court affirmed. It held that the Commonwealth had properly applied a version of &sect; 6 in force at the time the original petition was filed; that the application of the earlier version of &sect; 6 to defendant was constitutional and did not violate his equal protection rights; and that a prior determination that the Commonwealth had not complied with &sect; 6 was not tantamount to a finding that defendant was not sexually dangerous and did not bar further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motions to dismiss the petition, and it remanded to the superior court with directions to hold further proceedings to determine whether defendant was properly committed for treatment as a sexually dangerous person.</SPAN></P>

Almost four years later the department filed a second complaint under a successor statute to the repealed ch. 273, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C. The court affirmed the contested judgment because the dismissal with prejudice of the first complaint barred the second complaint. The court held that re-adjudication was precluded by ch. 209C. The court ruled that the dismissal with prejudice of the first criminal complaint was the equivalent of an acquittal of the purported father, which prevented the department from filing the second complaint against him. The court decided that the dismissal of the first complaint with prejudice was a final adjudication under ch. 273. The department was prohibited by the doctrine of separation of powers in the Mass.

</DIV>

The court affirmed, inter alia, the trial court's judgment. The court did not address the constitutionality of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 210, &sect; 2 because the putative father did not pursue his original request of a report to the intermediate appellate court on the issue of its constitutionality. The trial court did not err in dismissing the complaint to establish paternity. It was legally irrelevant whether the putative father was in fact the child's father because his rights, duties, and legal consequences were terminated when the trial court signed the adoption order and because the single justice denied the putative father's petition to for leave to appeal the judgment of adoption. Furthermore, the trial court did not err in denying the putative father's petition to revoke the judgment of adoption because once the court's single justice denied his petition for leave to appeal the adoption, the putative father could not seek to revoke the adoption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant hired new counsel, and in addition to the appeal of his conviction and the denial of his motion for a new trial, defendant also appealed the denial of his motion for new trial, which was heard by the trial judge on remand. The court consolidated both the appeals. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial judge erred in giving a supplemental instruction in response to a jury question regarding deliberate premeditation. Defense counsel did not object to the supplemental instruction. The court found that the trial judge failed to redefine premeditation. Because the jury's question sought to assistance in exploring the distinction between murder in the first and second degree, the trial judge's silence on premeditation fell short of providing a comprehensible standard to guide them. Based on the supplemental instruction given, the jury could have understood that the Commonwealth was relieved of its burden to prove deliberate premeditation as well as malice, in order for them to return a verdict of murder in the first-degree. Moreover, the judge's main charge to the jury before they retired to deliberate did not cure the flaw of the supplemental instruction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts presented the court with an order requesting an advisory opinion regarding House No. 5858, entitled &quot;An Act establishing the economic stability and recovery compact&quot; (Act).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor had doubts about the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Act and presented a question to the court, pursuant to Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights amend. art. 85. In this advisory opinion, the court stated that it restricted its response to the important, broad issue, implicit in the governor's question of whether the legislature had the authority to impose an excise upon the sale of services enumerated in House No. 5858 as &quot;commodities&quot; pursuant to the taxing power conferred by Mass. Const. Part II, ch. 1, &sect; 1, art. 4. Thus, after a review of the meaning of the word &quot;commodities &quot; in the state constitution, the court answered the question in the affirmative and concluded that once it was appreciated that the word &quot;commodities&quot; in the state constitution was not limited to tangible personal property, but included those benefits, privileges, and activities that could be regulated by the commonwealth, an excise upon the sale of services, as enumerated in House No. 5858, fell within the legislature's authority under the state constitution, provided it was reasonable and was not a property or income tax masquerading as an excise.</SPAN></P>

The court, on its own initiative, transferred the case to its own docket. At issue was whether the taxpayer was entitled to job incentive deductions for the wages it paid to certain employees working at its facilities located in impoverished parts of the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer obtained certificates of eligibility from the state agency that administered the job incentive program, and claimed deductions for portions of the wages it paid to workers hired at its eligible facilities. The commissioner disallowed a portion of the job incentive deductions and the taxpayer sought review in the Tax Appeals Court, which affirmed the commissioner's decision. The taxpayer sought review. The court held that the commissioner was incorrect in disallowing the deductions for employees residing in communities contiguous to areas eligible for the incentive program because the enabling legislation clearly provided that deductions could be claimed for such employees if they had not moved in the prior year. The court found that a later-enacted statutory cap on the amount of deduction allowed per employee could not be imposed retroactively to employees living in the eligible areas, but held that the cap could be applied to employees domiciled in contiguous areas because in amending the original legislation to permit a deduction for such employees, the legislature created a new category of employees and as to them, the application of the cap was not retroactive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the taxpayer was entitled to the full job incentive deductions it claimed for employees domiciled in municipalities designed as eligible, and held that the taxpayer was entitled to take a deduction, up to the statutory cap, for employees domiciled in contiguous municipalities who had not moved in the prior year. The court remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 29, &sect;&sect; 9B and 9C (1988) to withhold $ 210 million dollars in local school aid funds, known as chapter 70 aid, appropriated in the fiscal year 1990 budget. The court held that the funds appropriated by the line item in question were not subject to reduction pursuant to &sect; 9C, because the school aid funds appropriated by that line item, and assigned in specific amounts to cities and towns by &sect; 3 of the fiscal year 1990 appropriation act, were not made available to any state agency under the governor's control. On a separate request, the court held that 1989 Mass. Acts ch. 240, &sect; 6 lawfully limited distributions of certain state lottery proceeds to cities and towns during fiscal years 1989 and 1990. In modifying the normal appropriation of lottery funds made by the general laws, the court found that the legislature engaged in a process that directly concerned the appropriation of funds for local aid, but that the municipalities failed to present an adequate basis for judicial action under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 29B. The court directed that judgments be entered consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court directed that judgment enter in superior court declaring that the governor lacked authority under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 29, &sect;&sect; 9B and 9C to authorize a reduction in the line item 1990 fiscal appropriation procedures reducing the amount of local school aid funds. The court directed the trial court to enter judgment that reduced distributions for cities and towns during fiscal years 1989 and 1990 from state lottery receipts were lawful.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed. In remanding the judgment, the court held that the district court improperly assessed costs without a hearing because the assessment could only be made in the case of willful default, which could not be determined without a hearing, thus leaving the district court without any basis for its judgment. The court held, and the Commonwealth agreed, that defendant was entitled to a hearing on the default. The court also held that nothing in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 36 permitted the district court judge to incarcerate defendant for his failure to pay the fines without first determining whether defendant had the ability to pay the fine. The court also held, and the Commonwealth agreed, that defendant should have been permitted to &quot;work off&quot; the costs and fines pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 127, &sect; 144.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that there was no evidence that defendant had or was about to engage in criminal activity at the time of the search. The court determined that the fact that defendant had been seen in public with a handgun was not illegal per se because the holding of a valid license was an affirmative defense to prosecution under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(a) (1988) for the carrying of an illegal handgun.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation's applications for abatement of corporate excise taxes paid to Massachusetts for sales in New York were filed after the statute of limitations set forth in Mass.

On appeal, the corporation argued that the court should engraft a discovery rule onto &sect; 37 for seeking an abatement so as to avoid the inequitable result of paying taxes to two states for the same sales. The court affirmed the tax board's decision that the corporation did not comply with &sect; 37. The court further held that the fact that the corporation did not seek abatement within the applicable time period did not render the tax scheme unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause or the Due Process Clause. The court held that while due process required the state to give notice of, and an opportunity to challenge, a tax assessment, the state did not violate due process by requiring recourse to be conditioned on compliance with time limitations.

After oral argument on appeal, the United States Supreme Court held the overbreadth argument to be moot and remanded to the court for proceedings on the remaining issue, an as-applied federal constitutional attack on the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In considering defendant's as-applied federal constitutional attack on the statute, the court held that although defendant raised an as-applied challenge to the statute's constitutionality in a pretrial motion, he failed to preserve it at trial.

The court held that since the issue was not raised before the trial court, defendant waived his right to bring the issue before the court. The court determined that contrary to defendant's argument, his conduct was not pure speech but a mix of conduct and speech. The court ruled that the commonwealth had a freer hand in restricting expressive conduct and that the commonwealth asserted an interest in support of defendant's conviction, protecting minors from exploitation, that was unrelated to the suppression of expression.

The lower court adjudged defendant an SDP and committed him to the treatment center. Defendant's petition for review was granted, but the court affirmed the lower court. The court held that the test of defendant's commitment was whether constitutional and statutory minimums had been met and not whether there were optimally different or better ways of doing things. Defendant's rights under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A and the Due Process Clause were not violated by the order committing him to the treatment center. There was clear testimony at the SDP hearing that the treatment center offered professionally supervised programs designed to aid in the rehabilitation of SDPs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department of Mental Retardation sought review of a preliminary injunction issued by the Probate Court (Massachusetts) directing it to pay for the care of an autistic and severely retarded adult at a private, residential facility where the adult had lived and been treated over a period of years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A severely retarded adult sought injunctive relief against the Department of Mental Retardation (department) requiring it to provide a safe and adequate treatment and habilitation program. The probate court issued a preliminary injunction directing the department to pay a private residential facility for the adult's care at the approved rate. The court granted motions for direct appellate review of the department's appeal. The court vacated the preliminary injunction and directed that the motion for such relief should be denied. The court held that the proper procedure for asserting the adult's rights against the department would have been the filing of a separate complaint or the filing of a motion to add the department as a party to an existing guardianship proceeding, alleging the grounds and the nature of the relief sought. The court found that the probate court would have been warranted in entering an injunction directing the department to provide care and protective services to the adult and defining the level of such care and services, as well as where the care would take place.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the preliminary injunction and remanded the case to the probate court. The court directed that, after the adult filed an amended complaint in the existing guardianship proceeding, or filed a separate new complaint, the probate judge could enter a preliminary injunction consistent with the court's opinion, followed by a trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff league appealed from an order of a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court for the County of Suffolk (Massachusetts), which vacated a preliminary injunction that required defendant abortion activists to refrain from interfering with league's abortion activities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A single justice vacated a preliminary injunction that required abortion activists to refrain from trespassing on, or obstructing access to, league's offices or clinics where abortion, counseling, and family planning services were provided. The court ordered reinstatement of the injunction because it represented a proper exercise of the discretion accorded to judges to provide appropriate interlocutory relief. The court held that the preliminary injunction was narrow, carefully tailored, reasonably specific, and did not threaten abortion activists' First Amendment rights. The injunction prohibited only that conduct which, although expressive, was not protected by the First Amendment. Therefore, it was not overbroad. Moreover, the state's interest in imposing the injunction justified the minimal limitations that were placed on abortion activists' expressive activity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the suspension of the preliminary injunction, and reinstated the injunction until the final disposition of the case or until further order of the court.</SPAN></P>
