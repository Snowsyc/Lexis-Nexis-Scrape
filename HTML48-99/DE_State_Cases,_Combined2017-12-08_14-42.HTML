</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The testator set up a charitable trust in his will. The proceeds of the trust were to be distributed to various beneficiaries per the direction of the agent. The agent in turn filed an action against the state and trustee in order to obtain a decree that would instruct her as to how to distribute the proceeds among the class of beneficiaries designated in the testator's will. The testamentary trust directed that its proceeds be distributed to and for the support of the poor white persons. The court in turn considered whether or not such type of discriminatory action was violative of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court in turn concluded that its deep involvement in the administration of trust was of such an established and pervading nature so as to activate the protections of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Cy pres was thus applied by the court to reform it to provide for the support of all persons regardless of color, and the agent was directed to distribute the proceeds of the trust per the testator's direction, save that she was not to pay any mind to the race of those persons that received distributions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff State Highway Department, an agency of the State of Delaware, filed an action against defendant county officials, seeking to enjoin them from interfering with the department's proposed relocation and replacement of sewer lines installed and operated by the county officials under public streets. The county officials counterclaimed for condemnation damages. Both sides sought summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The department initiated an action against the county officials seeking to restrain them from interfering with the relocation and replacement of certain sewer lines that were installed and operated by the county officials under public streets. The county officials counterclaimed seeking condemnation damages. Both parties sought summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the department. It held that due to the broad public benefits in the county officials' installation and operation of the sewer line, their activities constituted the performance of a governmental, rather than a proprietary, activity. As the property involved was not private, it was not protected by constitutional guarantees against taking. The department took the disputed property in the course of performing its own proper governmental functions, and thus, no compensation was due the county officials for the taking and moving of which they complained other than as provided in Del. Code Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 145. The property in question was dedicated to public use and included the right to grade as well as lay sewers. As a governmental body, the county officials were not entitled to condemnation damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court denied the county officials' motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to the department in an action to enjoin interference with the relocation and replacement of sewer lines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant board came into being in 1917 as a part of a statutory plan to provide workers' compensation insurance coverage. In 1919, the Legislature granted the board authority to approve rates sought to be charged by the insurance companies engaged in insuring employers against liabilities imposed by the workmen's compensation laws. In 1947, under Del.Code Ann. tit 18, Chap. 23, defendant insurance commissioner was granted authority over the setting of rates for insurance companies doing business in Delaware on the basis of manual rates or rating plans for all risks other than inland marine coverage. The later statute was silent on the role of the board. Plaintiff sought declaration that the earlier statute was repealed by implication. Defendants contended that both the board and the insurance commissioner were required to approve plaintiff's proposed rates. The court found that the two statutes were inconsistent and applied rules of statutory construction to hold that the earlier statute had been repealed by implication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Decision for plaintiff because later statute repealed earlier statute by implication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff shareholders brought suit against defendant purchaser who bought their stock pursuant to an offer to buy made to all common stockholders of a tobacco company. The purchaser filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The purchaser made an offer to buy the shares of all the other stockholders of a tobacco company. Subsequently, the tobacco company was merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of the purchaser. Shareholders who did not tender their shares pursuant to the offer to buy or surrender them upon merger alleged acts of mismanagement, seizure of corporate opportunities, conspiracy to seize the assets of the tobacco company to the exclusion of the remaining shareholders, and the use of false, deceptive, and misleading statements to purchase shares pursuant to the offer to buy. The purchaser filed a motion to dismiss. In granting the motion to dismiss in part and denying it in part, the court held that (1) a merger with a subsidiary wholly owned by an alien corporation was not proscribed, (2) the court declined to say at a preliminary stage that the shareholders could not prove that the merger was achieved by fraud, (3) the shareholders were not representative of all stockholders but could maintain a class action on behalf of a class of which they were representative, and (4) because of the merger, the shareholders could not maintain a derivative action on behalf of the old corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The purchaser's motion to dismiss was granted as to the asserted representative causes of action on behalf of shareholders who sold their shares pursuant to the offer to buy, surrendered their shares on the merger, and retained their shares following the merger and joined in an appraisal action and as to the asserted derivative cause of action. In all other respects the motion to dismiss was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The treasurer sought to impose a tax on the telephone company, which was a New York corporation, pursuant to &sect; 4102. The telephone company was the parent corporation in a national system of associated operating companies that were locally owned and operated. The telephone company had no office and was not qualified to do business in Delaware. It did no business except transmit messages in interstate commerce. The court granted a summary judgment in favor of the telephone company and held that the tax placed an unconstitutional burden on the telephone company's interstate business. The court held that the incidence of the tax demonstrated that a privilege, rather than a property tax, was intended. The device of fixing a taxing day for the computation of the mileage of the telephone company's wires within Delaware without regard to the number of strands in such wires or their value was essentially the type of formula that was deemed a privilege tax. The court held that the tax was imposed on the occupation of being engaged in the telephone business, whether as owner, lessee, or otherwise with no discrimination being made between intrastate and interstate business.</SPAN></P>

The parent filed a competing motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The minority stockholders held stock in the subsidiary and sought to prevent the merger between the subsidiary and the parent based on their contention that there was no authorization for a merger plan where cash rather than stock was exchanged. The parent argued that Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 253, as amended, authorized such an exchange because the parent owned at least 90 percent of the subsidiary's stock. The court agreed with the parent and granted its motion for summary judgment. The court held that the merger plan was valid and the amendatory language in &sect; 253 was not intended only to constitute a procedural extension of the power that was granted by Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 251. There was no confiscation of the minority stockholders' investments because they were not wiped out, only converted into what was assumed to be their fair monetary value. When the minority stockholders acquired their stock they did not thereby obtain a vested right to prevent the conversion of their stock interest into some other form pursuant to authority that was thereafter granted to the subsidiary. It followed then that &sect; 253 was not unconstitutional as applied to the minority stockholders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the minority stockholders' motion for summary judgment and granted the parent's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff utility company sought a declaratory judgment that a certain &quot;franchise fee&quot; ordinance adopted by defendant City of Newark was invalid, illegal, unconstitutional, and void. The utility company further sought an injunction restraining the city from attempting to enforce the ordinance or collect the &quot;fee&quot; imposed thereby. The utility company subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">By an earlier franchise ordinance, the city granted the utility company the right to erect poles and wires on certain streets with the proviso that the utility company would not sell electricity within the city unless requested to do so by the council. The city subsequently passed an ordinance imposing a franchise fee upon the distribution and sale of electricity by the utility company within the city to all customers other than the city itself. The utility company filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that the franchise fee ordinance was invalid, and filed a motion for summary judgment. The court granted the motion for summary judgment and entered an injunction to enforce it. The court held that Del. Code Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 906, giving the limited franchise-granting power to the city, had to be construed to mean that once the franchises were granted, the city could not thereafter modify them while they were extant. Therefore, unless the fee was imposed at the time the franchise was granted or the power to amend was reserved at that time, it was beyond the power of the council thereafter to impose it during the term of the franchise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the utility company's motion for summary judgment, declaring the ordinance unenforceable and granting an injunction to enforce the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The issue presented was the legality of an increase in the maintenance assessments on the lot holders. The maintenance corporation filed a motion for summary judgment and defendant lot owner filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lot owner purchased his lot in the development and obtained a deed that referred to a controlling deed that contained articles that provided for the maintenance corporation, and its funding. At the time the lot owner purchased his lot, the amount of the assessment for maintenance was limited to one percent of the lot value, which became a lien on the property if not paid. The corporation then presented an amendment to the assessment amount to the lot owners, and an increase to two percent was approved by a vote of a majority of the lot owners. Defendant paid only one percent, and then paid nothing after the one percent was rejected. The corporation filed its action against him for eight years' assessments. The corporation filed a motion for summary judgment, and the lot owner filed a motion to dismiss. The court granted summary judgment to the maintenance corporation. The lot owner entered into a contract by his purchase of the lot, and the controlling deed language allowed the maintenance corporation to apply for the increase in assessment. No tax was involved, and the statute of limitations did not apply to foreclosure of the liens against the lot owner.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the lot owner's motion to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The gas company's subsidiary merged with an oil company in which the directors owned a majority interest, making the directors majority owners of the new company. Under a contract, the new company granted to the gas company the right to purchase gas produced by the new company at a fixed price. The contract was later amended to double the price. The Federal Power Commission (commission) approved the increased price. The stockholder brought an action against defendants, alleging that the amendment was part of a scheme to benefit the directors at the expense of the gas company and that defendants caused the gas company to pay taxes without protest under a state law later declared unconstitutional. The court granted defendants' motions for summary judgment and to dismiss. The court held that the stockholder failed to state a cause of action, because the power to inquire into subsidiary relationships and objections over established rates rested with the commission, and because the stockholder failed to charge fraud as to payment of the taxes. Dismissal was appropriate, because the action was barred by the three-year statute of limitations under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 8106.</SPAN></P>

Defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Del. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The motion was granted because plaintiff's attempt to use a declaratory judgment action was inappropriate. Since the release sought by plaintiff was not into the community, but for consideration of a reduction in his sentence, the statute was inapplicable and the petition failed to state a claim. Moreover, plaintiff did not meet the requisite factors of an actual controversy. The controversy had already been resolved and was no longer ripe because the pardons board had already reached its decision. Plaintiff was not entitled to have counsel appointed since U.S. Const. amend VI's guarantee to counsel did not extend to civil proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Defendant and victim had struggled inside a motel room, and defendant ended up stabbing the victim to death through the broken windshield of a car after another struggle. Following his conviction, defendant filed a motion for a new trial, arguing the court erred in not delivering an emotional distress defense instruction and that the evidence did not support the verdict. The court denied the motion for a new trial, finding that defendant was not entitled to the emotional distress instruction where, based on the evidence, no reasonable juror could find that the struggles with the victim could create a frenzy in defendant such that he was incapable of reason. That same evidence was ample to support a conviction for second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Motion for new trial was denied; the court found defendant was not entitled to an instruction on the emotional distress defense because no reasonable juror might have believed his struggle with the victim produced a frenzy rendering defendant incapable of reason and substantial evidence supported the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant institutional investigator for a state correctional center confiscated plaintiff inmate's mail, claiming that it contained incitements to insurgency and rebellion. Plaintiff thereafter filed a civil rights action against defendant individually and in his official capacity for declaratory relief and monetary damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Plaintiff sought a declaration that defendant's confiscation of his mail violated his First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, right to free speech and that he was deprived of liberty without due process of law. The court granted in part and denied in part defendant's motion for summary judgment, holding that defendant failed to meet his burden of showing that censorship of plaintiff's mail promoted the claimed penological objective of preventing violence. Specifically, defendant made no showing of the peculiar conditions of the prison at the time of the challenged action. Nevertheless, pre-deprivation procedures were not required given their impracticality and the availability of adequate post-deprivation remedies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's motion for summary judgment was granted with regard to his failure to provide a pre-deprivation hearing and to the extent that plaintiff sought damages from him in his official capacity since sovereign immunity barred recovery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, news media members, filed action contending they were entitled to arrest and conviction data under Delaware Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Del.

Both parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the court denied plaintiffs' cross-motion and granted defendants' cross motion. The court concluded plaintiffs might have been entitled to some of the information requested under FOIA, but that their request was overly broad and that permitting the disclosure requested by plaintiffs would have constituted an invasion of person privacy. As to plaintiffs' contention they were entitled to arrest and conviction data under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 8513 as a research agency, the court concluded that the statute expressly relegated news media to conviction data, and that if the media was intended to also have access to sensitive arrest information, the state legislature would have provided as much. Finally, the court rejected plaintiffs' contention that Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 8513 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

At the time of her death , the victim was nine months pregnant. Plaintiff announced that it intended to seek the death penalty against defendant.

Plaintiff argued that defendant's arguments were legally untenable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas (Delaware), which convicted him of driving while under the influence of alcohol in violation of Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4177(a). Appellant asserted that the state had failed to prove that appellant had a blood alcohol concentration of .10 or more within four hours after the time of driving.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Holding that the state had failed to prove an essential element of driving while under the influence of alcohol, Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4177(a)(5), the court vacated the conviction. The court stated that &sect; 4177(a)(5) required the state to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant's alcohol concentration had been .10 or more, that appellant had been driving, and that appellant's blood alcohol concentration had been .10 within four hours of driving. The court noted that testimony of the arresting police officer established that appellant had been driving, and that appellant's blood alcohol concentration had been .24. The court found no evidence in the record, however, that indicated whether the blood alcohol concentration was measured within four hours of the time appellant had been driving. Noting that appellant had objected to the introduction of the blood alcohol concentration evidence for a lack of foundation, that appellant had not specified that the time frame was the point of the objection, but that the trial court had allowed the objection for the record, the court held that the state had not proved the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated appellant's conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol, because the record contained no evidence to support a finding that appellant had been driving within four hours before he had a blood alcohol content of .10 or more, which was an essential element of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff union brought an action seeking a writ of mandamus against defendants. The plaintiff sought to have the court compel the defendants to enforce an ordinance requiring certain plumbing work to be done only by licensed plumbers. Defendants moved to dismiss arguing the statute which the plaintiff sought to enforce was unconstitutional, mandamus was an inappropriate remedy, and that the defendants had an adequate remedy short of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Seeking to have the court compel the defendants to enforce a county ordinance requiring that certain plumbing work be done only by licensed plumbers, the plaintiff union brought an action seeking a writ of mandamus. The court held that because there was no statutory basis upon which to predicate a basis for standing, the Oceanport/Lujan three-part analysis was necessary to determine whether the plaintiff had standing to assert its claim for a writ mandamus. In applying that analysis, the court held that plaintiff's assertion, that non-enforcement of the plumbing ordinance would result in damage to the health and welfare of area residents, was inadequate to show an actual injury sufficient to confer standing. The court held that plaintiff's pecuniary claim, that because non-licensed workers were performing work which its membership would otherwise perform, also failed to establish a basis for standing. Although the plaintiff's members were suffering a loss in wages, that loss was not one protected by the county plumbing ordinance. Therefore, because plaintiff failed to identify a claim held by its membership upon which to assert its own standing, it could not maintain the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss because the plaintiff union did not have standing to seek a writ of mandamus compelling the defendants to enforce a county ordinance. Under the Oceanport/Lujan analysis, because the members of the plaintiff union themselves did not have an identifiable claim to bring against the defendants, the plaintiff had no basis to assert on claim on behalf of those members.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff prisoner, who was facing the death penalty, filed suit against defendants, claiming that his constitutional rights had been violated by his classification as a maximum security inmate. Plaintiff also contended that copies of administrative grievance procedures were not readily available to him. Relying on the weight of case law, the court first held that plaintiff had no state-created liberty interest in his classification status. The court reasoned that the placement of prison inmates was within the wide spectrum of discretion granted to prison administrators. Thus, because appellant had no liberty interest in his classification, the court rejected appellant's due process claim. The court then held that, because defendants had a rational basis for classifying inmates facing death sentences as prisoners in need of maximum security, his equal protection claim also failed. However, the court held that defendants' failure to follow guidelines regarding the availability of grievance procedures for prisoners warranted denying defendants' motion to dismiss that portion of plaintiff's suit.</SPAN></P>

However, given the fact that he received an enhanced penalty solely because of the decision involving the first horse, plaintiff argued that the enhanced decision should be overturned. The court held that plaintiff had fair notice of the carbon dioxide test and the consequences of a positive test result and therefore, the disputed regulations were not unconstitutionally vague. The court also held that there was substantial evidence to support the ruling concerning the first horse. Therefore, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's accomplice acquired a false identification card, which he used to commit fraud, with the victim's assistance. Fearful the victim would report the fraud, defendant and his accomplice brutally murdered the victim and burned the body, which was not identified for two years. Defendant was convicted of murder, and the jury recommended that he be sentenced to death. However, the court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of probation or parole. While the court had to consider the sentencing recommendation of the jury, the final determination as to the appropriate sentence was for the court to decide. Under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209(d), the court was to impose a death sentence if it found beyond a reasonable doubt at least one statutory aggravating circumstance and if mitigating circumstances were outweighed by a preponderance of the evidence of the surrounding circumstances, defendant's character, and details of the crime. The weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances involved a qualitative rather than quantitative approach. Weighing all the factors present, the court determined that a death sentence was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee applied for attorney's fees covering appellant's recent appeal from the Industrial Accident Board (Board). Appellee was appellant's employee who sought disability payments for a compensable injury to his brain. The Board had reversed and remanded the matter, concluding that there was a lack of substantial evidence to make an award of permanent impairment to appellee. The issue was whether appellee was successful on appeal and, therefore, entitled to attorney's fees under 19 Del. Code Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 2350(f). To obtain attorney's fees under &sect; 2350(f), a party had to have proved success on appeal. The court denied appellee's application for attorney's fees, concluding that the Board's decision had not been affirmed on appeal, so it could not have been said that appellee was successful on appeal. The court reasoned that as the purpose of &sect; 2350(f) was to prevent depletion of a claimant's compensation award through attorney's fees incurred where a claimant successfully defended an employer's meritless appeal, a remand for further findings was not the equivalent of success for purposes of &sect; 2350(f).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied appellee's application for attorney's fees.

The reviewing court consolidated the two appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The reviewing court found that the New Castle County Department of Planning's letter of approval indicated that the certification would become null and void if circumstances surrounding the granting of the application were to change. The rescission of that letter was a correction of error and a prompt notification regarding the changed circumstances. Absent a showing by the applicants that they made a substantial change in position, the applicants did not acquire constitutional vested rights, and the rescission was supported by substantial evidence. The 2,800 foot separation as required by New Castle County, Del., Zoning Code &sect; 40-133(a)(13)(b) should be determined by a straight line measurement from the nearest building setback line of the proposed establishment, or, from the building containing the adult use, to the property line containing a school, church, or place of worship. It cannot be said that the board's decision to deny the applicants a zoning certification was irrational, unreasonable, or inconsistent with the legitimate purposes of the ordinance. The board's findings were supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court denied defendant's motion. The court held that the death penalty statute was constitutional and there was not merit to defendant's argument that the death penalty was unconstitutional due to its large number of aggravating factors. The court also decided that there was no infirmity in the statute because the factor was broader than the similar factor in Florida. The court further stated that the aggravating circumstance statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209(e)(1)u, was not so vague and overbroad as to have been unconstitutional.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was called in to investigate her disappearance. She had an affair with defendant, then attempted to break off the relationship.

The court denied the first suppression motion as untimely because defendant failed to timely present allegations sufficient to support it. As to the abuse motion, the court held that defendant recognized the issue long before the deadline for such motions and it was barred as not timely filed. On the second suppression motion, defendant argued that the government had no probable cause to believe that a kidnapping had occurred and that there were no facts to show that defendant had taken the victim from the state against her will. The court found that the FBI agent's affidavits provided evidence of probable cause to believe that defendant kidnapped the victim because the victim had tried to end the relationship, he had previous rages, he had previously confined her against her will, and the victim was last seen with him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of two counts of rape in the first degree, one count of attempted rape in the first degree, and one count of unlawful contact in the second degree.

Defendant then filed a second motion for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In his second motion, defendant argued, inter alia, that (1) the instant court lacked jurisdiction because he should have been charged with incest, not rape, and incest was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the family court; (2) since the indictment failed to allege certain key elements, such as force, intent, etc., the instant court lacked jurisdiction over him; (3) he was the victim of selective enforcement; and (4) he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Upon review, the court found defendant's arguments without merit. Defendant and the victim did not fall within any of the relationships that constituted incest. He was never married to the victim's mother nor or was he the victim's biological father. Defendant failed to make a case that he was singled out. The very nature of the crime demonstrated why different dispositions resulted and different sentences existed. Defendant's claim of lack of jurisdiction due to the failure of the indictment to be more specific about dates, location, and time of day was meritless. Even if counsel had raised the legal arguments defendant raised, they would have been rejected. On that basis, there was no ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant worked for the employer for 24 years. He stated that he had felt tightness and stiffness in his shoulders for several years due to lifting and pulling. On April 25, 1996, the claimant felt a pain in both of his shoulders that he had never felt before. He required surgery on both of his shoulders. The board concluded that the claimant had proven a compensable injury. The employer argued that according to the claimant's testimony, he experienced pain and stiffness for six to eight years prior to the worker's compensation hearing. Thus, his claim was barred by the statute of limitations, Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, 2361(a). Upon review, the court found that the board's conclusion that the claimant suffered a cumulative detrimental effect type injury that became acutely symptomatic at work on April 25, 1996, resolved statute of limitations argument. Further, the employer failed to comply with Del. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 8(c) and raise it in the pleadings. The court found that the employer failed to make a fair presentation of the defense to the board, especially since it did not raise the statute of limitations as an issue until its closing argument.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the legislature replaced &sect; 1312 with an amended version of &sect; 1312 that reformed the elements of the offense of aggravated harassment and changed the penalty for the offense. The language of the prior version of &sect; 1312 was incorporated into Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1311 (1996). Defendant appealed to the court. In response to the appeal, the State re-indicted defendant in the court on 10 counts of aggravated harassment pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1312 as it existed at the time of the offense. The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that &sect; 1312 had been repealed with no savings clause and that &sect; 1312 was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that because the revisions to the harassment and aggravated harassment statutes did not change the entire regulatory scheme, dismissal of the charges on the basis of the repealer was not required; the legislature clearly intended &sect; 1312 to operate continuously. The court held that &sect; 1312 was not unconstitutionally vague in proscribing the use of obscene language.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it was not illegal to impose a fine for the victim's compensation fund. The court held that there was a legitimate state purpose served by imposing on drug offenders an assessment to aid victims of violent crimes. The court held that it was not a violation of equal protection to make drug offenders face two assessments while non-drug offenders faced only one.

R. 61 for postconviction relief from a decision of the lower court (Delaware) that revoked his probation and resentenced him to two years and nine months and asserted that his original sentence was only for two years and that no probation should have been imposed.

Defendant's probation was revoked after another adjudication of guilty of violating probation on the delivery charge and then he filed the motion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A corporation brought an action which alleged that the Wholesaler Gross Receipts Tax, Del. Code Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 2901 et seq., violated both the Import-Export Clause and the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The court granted summary judgment to the state. The court held that, with respect to the Import-Export Clause, the principal issue revolved around whether the gross receipts tax was an impermissible duty or impost on imported goods. The court held that the gross receipts tax did not violate the Import-Export Clause because it was a nondiscriminatory tax that was not directed at imported goods still in transit. The court found that there was a sufficient nexus between the corporation's business activities and the state, that the tax was fairly apportioned, nondiscriminatory, and related to services provided by the state, and that the tax did not create the risk of international multiple taxation. The court found the tax had not violated the Commerce Clause because of the magnitude of the goods purchased, and the length of time the goods were within the state created the required nexus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed and held that the board acted properly in denying the claimant's requests to issue both regular subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum after he received a labor market survey from the employer. The failure to issue subpoenas was not prejudicial to the claimant and did not hinder his efforts to carry the burden of proof that he was a displaced worker. The court affirmed as to the trial court's use of the burden of proof under the displaced worker doctrine. It did not violate substantive due process and did not conflict with the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Delaware Handicapped Persons Employment Protection Act. The anti-discrimination measures did not prohibit an employer from asking into the potential employee's condition and did not unduly hinder claimants in efforts to meet the burden of proof. The court affirmed as to the denial of total disability benefits after his treating doctor released the claimant without restrictions. It was not erroneous to deny a grace period in which a claimant was entitled to benefits while he searched for a new job within his limitations. The court found that the denial of a medical witness fee was erroneous and reversed.</SPAN></P>

The employee further claimed that the Board erred when it denied a doctor's witness fee. The court determined that pursuant to 19 Del.

However, the court found that the failure of the Board to issue subpoenas was not prejudicial to the employee. If the employer satisfied its burden of demonstrating that the employee no longer was incapacitated totally for the purpose of working, the employee was required to show that he was a displaced worker in order to receive total benefits. The court held that the Board's determination that the employee failed to meet the displaced worker standard was supported by substantial evidence. The court further found that the displaced worker doctrine was not in conflict with federal legislation. However, the doctor's witness fee was permissible under 19 Del. C. &sect; 2322(e).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants sought review of their convictions and sentences by the Superior Court of Delaware. Defendants were convicted of intentional murder and felony murder and were sentenced to death. Defendants' convictions were upheld on direct appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants' convictions for intentional and felony murder were based on the contradictory testimony of a female witness. Defendants' convictions and death sentences were upheld on direct appeal. The court denied defendants' motions for postconviction relief. As to both defendants the court held that: (1) postconviction hearings were not required; (2) intoxication was not a defense; (3) the holding of joint proceedings was proper; (3) counsel acted reasonably in not requesting severance; and (4) counsel properly investigated mitigating evidence. As to the first defendant's claims the court held that: (1) there was no evidence that the female witness was intoxicated at trial or that the prosecutor intimidated her; (2) counsel's failure to question the female witness about her new story was reasonable; (3) counsel acted reasonably in not questioning allocution limitations; and (4) the prosecutor's comment on remorse was a fair response. As to the second defendant's claims, the court held that: (1) counsel met its duty as to pretrial investigation; (2) counsel's advising defendant not to testify was reasonable; and (3) counsel's failure to request a new trial could not be relitigated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied defendants' motions for postconviction relief. The court held that neither defendant proved that their claims, which had not been raised on direct appeal, were not raised due to good cause, nor that actual prejudice resulted from the failure to raise them. Defendants' attorneys did not render ineffective assistance and the trial court did not err in any of its procedural determinations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Industrial Accident Board (Delaware) (board) approved a commutation of workers' compensation benefits in a proceeding between plaintiff claimant and defendant employer. The board also allowed the claimant's counsel the statutory maximum attorney's fee, which was less than the counsel's 30 percent contingency fee agreement. On remand, the board identified the rationale for the fee award and the counsel appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 19, &sect;&sect; 2126 and 2127, permitted the board general authority over all fees charged by claimants' attorneys for services related to workmen's compensation matters and provided the board with autonomy over fee awards by setting an arbitrary limitation on fee awards and by giving it the authority to award a fee less than the statutory maximum. The counsel contended that the statutes violated the basic constitutional principle of separation of powers because the Delaware Supreme Court had sole authority over the fees of attorneys in the state. The court affirmed the board's fee award because although the power being exercised under the statutes was exclusively judicial, neither statute was an unconstitutional usurpation of that power. The court found that the statutes demonstrated a cooperative venture between the legislature and the judiciary to provide employees with a prompt remedy for workplace injuries. The court also found that the record was devoid of any evidence that the counsel's time, energy, and talent in achieving a commutation were effectively confiscated by the statutory attorney's fee limitation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the board's decision that only awarded the claimant's counsel the statutory limit of attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff sued defendant and defendant state employees in capacities supervisory of defendant (state defendants), alleging claims in tort and under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant hit plaintiff while on a work detail; both supervised work details and were corporals. The state defendants quickly disciplined defendant. The court first decided plaintiff could amend his complaint to add a failure to train claim, but could not add a claim for injunctive relief. Injunctive relief was within the sole jurisdiction of the chancery court. Plaintiff's claim was compensable under the Delaware's Workmen's Compensation Act, but there was a material fact issue as to whether the exclusivity provision of Del. Code Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 2304 applied because defendant's assault may have been personal and not work related. The 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim was based on plaintiff's constitutional right against unjustified intrusions on his personal security. Plaintiff did not demonstrate the state defendants had prior knowledge of constitutional deprivations (defendant's propensity for violence) or played any affirmative role, such as deliberate indifference, in a deprivation, or were not entitled to qualified immunity. Plaintiff also did not demonstrate how the state defendants' actions did not entitle them to the shield of Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 4001 governmental immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two separate defendants were charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). In one case, the Court of Common Pleas (Delaware), entered a decision that the DUI statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4177(a)(5), (b)(2), making &quot;drinking after driving&quot; an affirmative defense, was unconstitutional. In the other case, the court found that the State failed to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The State appealed both decisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants argued that the DUI statute was unconstitutional because it shifted the burden to the defense of proving the affirmative defense that the alcohol was consumed after the time of the driving and before the time of sampling. The State argued that it only had to prove physical control of a vehicle and the required percentage of alcohol concentrated in defendants' system. The State argued that it did not need to prove that the blood alcohol concentration was 0.10 or greater at the time of driving, because Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4177(b)(2) provided an affirmative defense. Defendants argued that it was the State's burden to prove every fact necessary to constitute the crime, and that drinking after driving was a denial of an essential element of the crime of DUI that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court agreed with defendants. The affirmative defense provision of the DUI statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4177(b)(2), was unconstitutional because it relieved the State of its burden of proving every element beyond a reasonable doubt, by imposing the burden on a defendant to disprove that the defendant was under the influence when driving.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State brought a motion to declare defendant a habitual offender and defendant brought a motion for a new trial after defendant was found guilty of second degree burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of second degree burglary. He was previously convicted of another charge of second degree burglary. The State used those two convictions plus a conviction for delivery of cocaine in North Carolina to form the basis of the motion to declare defendant a habitual offender pursuant to 11 Del. C.&sect; 4214(b), which required the imposition of a mandatory life sentence. As to the State's motion, the court held that the foreign conviction could be used to determine habitual offender status. For this purpose, the State supplemented the record by documents introduced in the appendix to its memorandum. Therefore, in order to give defendant the opportunity to respond to the issues surrounding the conviction in North Carolina, the court scheduled a later hearing at which time the State could move the admission of the documents and defendant could respond. The court refused to hear defendant s motion because the arguments would have to be addressed on appeal, as the motion was not filed within seven days of the guilty verdict as required by Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure (Delaware). Therefore, the court lacked jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court scheduled a later hearing on the State's motion and held that it had no jurisdiction to rule on defendant's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Del. Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 after violating the conditions of his probation on a conviction for stalking under 11 Del. C. &sect; 1312A. Defendant had been sentenced to 18 months in prison, suspended after six months for probation, and after his probation was revoked, he was resentenced to the entire 18 months, plus six months of home confinement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant entered a guilty plea on one count of stalking, and he was sentenced to 18 months in prison, suspended after six months for probation. After completing his jail time, defendant violated his probation, which was revoked, and he was resentenced to the entire 18 month sentence plus six months of home confinement. Defendant sought postconviction relief, claiming that his plea was unknowing and that 11 Del. C. &sect; 1312A was unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The court held that as the facts demonstrated that defendant was in fact guilty of stalking, in that there was sufficient evidence to convince a reasonable jury that defendant wilfully, maliciously, and repeatedly followed the victim or harassed her, there was a basis in fact for defendant's guilty plea. The court found that defendant's attorney was effective in that he repeatedly discussed the charges with defendant and explained how the victim's allegations constituted stalking, and thus, defendant's plea knowing and voluntary. The court concluded that defendant's claim that 11 Del. C. &sect; 1312A was void for vagueness was barred because he neglected to raise the issue earlier and failed to show cause or prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was released to work pursuant to 11 Del. C.&sect; 6532. The court held that although 11 Del. C.&sect; 6532(g) provided prisoners the opportunity for outside work release status, there was no legal right to it. The court also held that while a prisoner could be granted off site status when he met certain eligibility requirements and prison authorities, exercising their discretion, concurred that it was appropriate, as a corollary, once such status was granted, the Department of Correction had the discretion to later revoke it. Concluding that the inmate had no legal right to off site status and that the conferring or revocation of it was discretionary, the court held that a writ of mandamus was not an appropriate remedy. The inmate claimed that the prison officials' decision as to his off site status denied him substantive due process and equal protection of the law. But the court held that as those civil rights claims could have been brought in either State or federal court pursuant of &sect; 1983 and so would have provided the inmate with an adequate legal remedy, mandamus relief was not available as the inmate never pursued those avenues.</SPAN></P>

He also contended several counts of the indictment against him should have been merged for sentencing purposes. The jury made a sentencing recommendation that the death penalty be administered pursuant to 11 Del. C. &sect;&sect; 636 and 4209(a) by a vote of eleven to one. Defendant contended that &sect; 4209 provided for so many statutory aggravating circumstances that it fails to adequately narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty. He argued that the State had impermissibly stacked the aggravating circumstances in his case and that no consideration of mercy had been given. Under the Delaware statutes, a recommendation for the death penalty was not required to be unanimous. Despite this factor, the constitutionality of the Delaware death penalty had been previously upheld. The court also found that amendments to &sect; 4209, which effectively considered aggravating factors to narrow the class eligible for the death penalty were constitutional as the circumstances did not apply to all defendants convicted of murder and were not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, the New Castle County Council, the President, and its members, initiated an action against defendants, the State of Delaware and candidates for contested Council seats, seeking a declaratory judgment that 70 Del. Laws chapters 568 and 569 (Delaware) unconstitutionally shortened the terms of office of the members. Both sides filed motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statutes provided that the elected Council members were to take office on the first Tuesday in November following the general election instead of the first Tuesday in January following the general election, as was the procedure prior to the enactment of the statutes. Plaintiffs filed the action under 10 Del. C. &sect; 6501 (Delaware) claiming that the statutes unconstitutionally removed them from office in contravention of the Delaware Constitution. The court found that there was a general presumption that any act of the Delaware General Assembly was constitutional, and if there were two reasonable interpretations of a statute, the court was required to choose the one which saved the statute from constitutional attack. The court further determined that Council members, as public officers, could have had either a fixed or an indefinite term. The court held that the legislature had the right to create the office of Council member and that the legislature also had the right to abolish or modify such office. Inasmuch as the statutes were not aimed at the specific members, there was no constitutional prohibition against the shortening of the terms.</SPAN></P>

The former client testified about an exhibit that was later determined to be forged. Former client filed an action in California that alleged bank and corporation conspired against him and intentionally planted the falsified document. The court found that the testimony and documents sought by the subpoenas were protected by the attorney-client and work-product privileges. The court held that (1) the California court's ruling that former client waived the attorney-client privilege was not applicable because it applied to communications that fell outside the subpoenas, and the California court held that such waiver did not waive communications as to former client's potential criminal liability. (2) The state's need for information did not eviscerate the protections of the attorney-client privilege. (3) The crime-fraud exception did not apply. (4) The materials sought were prepared in anticipation of the chancery court action and that action was closely related to the action for which they were now sought.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former employee contended that these fee statutes violated the Doctrine of Separation of Powers because Board approval of fees encroached upon the court's historically exclusive authority to regulate the conduct of lawyers, including the reasonableness of their fees. The court determined that the Board was required by the provisions of 29 Del. C. &sect; 10142(d) to only award attorney's fees in amount that was established by substantial relevant evidence, which the Board was required to reduce to findings for the court to review. The court further determined that the Board had made no findings and there was no record that the award of attorney's fees by the board was based upon Delaware Lawyer's Rules of Professional Conduct. The court concluded that the constitutional issues raised by the parties' were not ripe for decision by the court on appeal in the absence of the Board having identified the factors considered in determining the reasonableness of any fee awarded.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police arrested defendant for sexual assault in Maryland. Defendant made four statements. During the first questioning, defendant explicitly and in writing waived his Miranda rights and signed a form waiving his right to be promptly presented to a judicial officer. During this interview, defendant made admissions to the sexual assault. Another detective questioned defendant regarding the assault and he made admissions of other assaults. A third detective from Delaware interviewed defendant and informed him that he was under the same waivers and this time defendant made admissions to sexual assaults in that state. A fourth tape-recorded interview occurred in which defendant made the same admissions. The court denied defendant's motion to suppress. The court concluded that defendant did not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights because he did not request a lawyer at any time. The court also concluded that defendant's request to talk to &quot;someone&quot; was not a request to talk to an attorney. Even if defendant's request could have been seen as an &quot;ambiguous or equivocal&quot; request for counsel, the court concluded that there was no obligation for police to cease questioning.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that because defendant, wishing to exonerate himself as a suspect, voluntarily consented to accompany the police to headquarters for the taking of his known inked fingerprint impressions, no arrest without probable cause occurred by the mere transporting of defendant to headquarters. Instead, the court held that the investigatory detention continued and was predicated on a reasonable and articulable suspicion that a crime had occurred in which defendant was suspected of having committed. Moreover, the court held that defendant voluntarily consented to the detention, the scope of which was limited in nature. The court held that there was a reasonable basis for believing that fingerprinting defendant would establish or negate his connection to the robbery. The court deferred pending further testimony defendant's motion to suppress his statement to police.</SPAN></P>

C. &sect; 1318, effective July 1, 1991, regulating payment for accumulated sick and annual leave. The parties filed motions for partial summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court previously ruled that the provisions covering accumulated sick leave was constitutional, leaving the issue of the constitutionality of calculating accumulated annual leave under &sect; 1318(i) of the amendment. Plaintiffs contended that limiting payment for unused annual leave to retiring employees infringed upon earned benefits and that the new &sect; 1318(g) divisor used to calculate accumulated leave under &sect; 1318(i) decreased the value of those benefits, in violation of Contract Clause of the United States Constitution, Article I, &sect; 10. The court observed that retirement was not a statutory predicate to cashing out unused annual leave prior to the 1991 amendment and that it was the practice of school districts to permit employees who terminated their employment for reasons other than retirement to cash-in their annual leave using a lower divisor. Accordingly, the court concluded that the right to cash in annual leave was contractually secured and, thus, not subject to impairment. The court further rejected defendant's claim that the prior payment of accumulated leave benefits to employees leaving their school jobs violated Article VIII, &sect; 6 of the Delaware Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of accumulated annual leave and denied defendants' similar motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants filed a motion for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 of the Superior Court Criminal Rules (Delaware) after a jury found them guilty of exploiting a victim. Defendants were charged with using the victim's resources and causing her to spend more than $ 500 for improvement to her house and to execute a will making one of the defendants the beneficiary of an option to purchase the house for an amount below the fair market value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied defendants' motion, holding that the State presented sufficient evidence for the jury to find a conspiratorial agreement between defendants. The evidence directly pointed to defendants having full knowledge of each others activities and to fully participating in the criminal activity. The overt acts alleged in the indictment did not have to be committed by each defendant as long as one of them committed at least one of the overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. The jury found that both defendants committed acts of theft and attempted theft and exploitation of an infirm adult. It submitted sufficient evidence to the jury to establish the &quot;infirm&quot; status of the victim as required by 31 Del. C. &sect; 3902. Experts provided the jury a framework as to the disease of Alzheimer and the effect it would have on one's ability to function. The evidence was sufficient to establish that defendants took substantial steps that would eventually result in the theft of the victim's property. The circumstantial evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that the value to which the option to buy the house would bring to defendants exceeded the $ 500 threshold.</SPAN></P>

The licensee appealed, contending that he had never had a driver's license in Pennsylvania and as such, there was nothing for the Department to suspend or revoke. The court held that (1) the record, which contained exhibits of 53 traffic violations by a person with the same name and date of birth in Pennsylvania, constituted substantial evidence to support the Department's decision; (2) the licensee could not be considered a habitual offender under Delaware motor vehicle laws because he had not been deemed as such pursuant to 21 Del.

Less than two years after the state supreme court affirmed the convictions on appeal, defendant sought postconviction relief. The court determined that, although the time limitation in Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(i)(1) did not bar the motion, arguments that were raised and decided on direct appeal were procedurally barred because defendant had not alleged that reconsideration of the claims would have been the interests of justice pursuant to Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(i)(4). The court also determined that, except for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, the remaining claims were barred under Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(i)(3) because they had not been brought in a prior proceeding and defendant failed to establish cause and prejudice. The court concluded that counsel had fairly and zealously advocated his client's interests, that the representation was well within the bounds of reasonable professional assistance, and that no prejudice resulted to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A grand jury handed down a 16-count indictment against defendant husband and wife. Pretrial the husband an wife filed a motion in limine, a motion to dismiss certain counts, a second motion for a bill of particulars, and discovery requests. The state filed a motion in limine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

Code Ann. tit. 31, &sect; 3913, forgery, and perjury in violation of Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1222. The court held that Del. Code Ann. tit. 31, &sect; 3913 was not unconstitutionally vague because the terms therein were sufficiently clear to give the husband and wife notice of the charge to defend themselves. The charge under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1222 not dismissed because whether the state could meet the burden of proof was a question of fact for trial. A ruling on the admissibility of the testimony of a doctor who testified at the victim's guardianship hearing was reserved until the state proffered said testimony outside the presence of the jury for the court to determine whether such was more probative of the victim's mental capacity than any other evidence the state could obtain through reasonable efforts. Under the second bill of particulars the state was ordered to disclose to the husband and wife evidence establishing the value of the purchase option or the fair market value of the victim's home. The polygraph tests were inadmissible due to lack of proof of reliability.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the removal of certain jurors who were opposed to the death penalty did not violate defendant's rights because the jurors indicated that their opposition to the death penalty would render them unable to follow the trial court's instruction regarding a decision on punishment. The court also held that the fact that the jury was not unanimous in its recommendation of the death penalty did not violate defendant's rights.

Defendant filed a motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Del. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61, asserting ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant contended that the shooting of his girlfriend was accidental as his gun discharged while he was attempting to break into her apartment. Defense counsel met with defendant and performed an investigation regarding the accident defense, including consulting an expert, but did not pursue the theory strongly at trial upon determining it was implausible. The court held that defendant's motion was without merit because even assuming that trial counsels' performance fell below objectively reasonable standards, defendant failed to show prejudice in that there was no &quot;reasonable probability&quot; that the result of the trial would have been different.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, car dealerships and guarantor, had an agreement with defendant car manufacturer that allowed plaintiffs to be the sole distributors of defendant's automobiles in the United Kingdom. Defendant was an Italian car manufacturer that was owned by a company incorporated in Delaware but headquartered in Michigan. Plaintiffs filed an action against defendant alleging fraud and breach of contract. The court granted defendant's motion to dismiss, holding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over defendant. First, defendant had not engaged in a persistent course of conduct in Delaware, as required by Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3104(c)(4). The fact that defendant was owned by a company incorporated in Delaware did not demonstrate such. Moreover, plaintiff made no allegations that defendant's parent company had ever acted as its alter ego or agent in Delaware. Second, defendant's lack of minimum contacts with Delaware made an exercise of personal jurisdiction violative U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Finally, because the forum selection clause in the agreement which designated Italy as the forum was valid and enforceable, plaintiff's request for jurisdictional discovery was denied.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the inmate's motion and amended motion for relief. It found that the inmate had not shown any prejudice stemming from the destruction of knives seized from the inmate's fellow escapees because any error which may have existed in the handling of the knives did not impair the verdict's reliability. The court was not persuaded that defense counsel's representation was deficient because the decision not to ask to view the knives when they were available was within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. The court found no Brady violation in the State's disclosure of a witness's second statement prior to her testimony because the statement was not concealed from the inmate, was consistent with her trial testimony, and was not favorable to the inmate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with murder in the first degree, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and possession of a deadly weapon by a person prohibited. Defendant filed a motion to strike, seeking to have the State superior court (Delaware) find that, as a matter of law, 11 Del.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State advised the court and defendant that it intended to seek the death penalty if defendant was convicted on the charge of murder in the first degree. The State's basis was 11 Del. C.&sect; 4209(e)(1)s., which provided for the death penalty if the victim was &quot;14 years of age or younger.&quot; The victim in the case was 14 years, 6 months, and 13 days old. Defendant maintained that the statutory aggravating factor did not apply to a child once the child had passed the child's fourteenth birthday. The court certified a question to the State supreme court. The issue was whether the supreme court's holding in a specified case compelled the conclusion that a child was &quot;14 years of age or younger&quot; from the date of the child's birth through the day of the child's fourteenth anniversary of birth, but not beyond, thus precluding the application of 11 Del. C. &sect; 4209(e)(1)s. to any child who, at the date of that child's death, had passed the fourteenth anniversary of that child's birth but who had not yet reached the fifteenth anniversary of that child's birth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation operated a reclamation project under contract with the Delaware Solid Waste Authority. The operation of the plant resulted in numerous complaints and convictions for violations of the regulations of the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. To remedy the odor problem, the corporation applied for a construction permit to build an odor containment device. The Secretary denied the application. The Board reversed the denial. On appeal, the court reversed the Board's holding. The corporation moved for reargument and to dismiss the decision that claimed that the case had become moot because its contract was terminated. The court denied the motion. The court's decision was an effort to clarify the ambiguities in Del. Code Ann. tit. 7, &sect; 60 for this and any subsequent appeals from permit decisions. The issue decided, the reviewing standard of the Board, was a matter of continuing public interest. Further, the issue was capable of repetition and would evade review until a similar dispute was raised. Thus, the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine applied. Under the facts presented, the rule of vacatur did not preclude such a result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An officer witnessed a vehicle driven by defendant turn left through a red light. He stopped defendant's car based on the traffic violation. He noticed that defendant had a blank stare and smelled of alcohol. Defendant, who was under 21, admitted to having had two beers and was arrested for underage drinking. Once at the station, the officer administered a breath test without giving Miranda rights or notification of the right to refuse the test. The officer then administered field sobriety tests and a second breath test and charged his with driving under the influence. The trial court suppressed the results of the breath tests and dismissed the driving under the influence charge. On appeal, the court held that the results of both tests were properly suppressed. There was no implied consent by defendant to the tests because the officer had no probable cause to believe that defendant was intoxicated until after he administered the first test. As the officer failed to obtain actual consent or notify defendant of the possible use of the results against him, the first test was properly excluded. The second test was properly excluded as tainted fruit of the first test.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed defendant's convictions for first degree murder, possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony, and first degree conspiracy and the imposition of the death sentence, defendant filed a motion for postconviction relief. The court denied the motion, determining that defendant's claims were procedurally barred under Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 61(i) and were subject to summary dismissal under Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 61(h)(3). Defendant's claims that could have previously been brought or that had already been adjudicated were procedurally barred. Defendant's argument that the death sentence statute was unconstitutional on the ground that it precluded consideration of mercy was without merit because sympathy was not relevant evidence of a mitigating factor and the jury was not to be swayed by such sentiment. Defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were without merit because the substantive issues in the claims had already been adjudicated and defendant failed to show prejudice. Failure to introduce defendant's criminal history at sentencing was not error where it was aggravating, not mitigating, evidence.</SPAN></P>

The businessman sought review by a writ of certiorari in a proceeding that also involved appellees, a Board of Adjustment, certain Board members, and a civic association.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Neighbors complained about the noise, traffic, and dirt associated with the garden business. The Board granted a petition for a special exception if the parties agreed about certain conditions that the Board had set. When no agreement was reached, the Board denied the petition. On review, the court described its standard of review, explaining that substantial evidence was necessary to sustain the Board's decision. The court, however, decided pursuant to 9 Del. C. &sect; 1353(e) to appoint a referee to make findings and conclusions. The court determined that the businessman had agreed to do whatever was necessary to come to an agreement, but that the Board had read too much into his offer, and that as a result, the Board had given all of its power to the neighbors to determine whether the business met the criteria in New Castle County Code &sect; 23-85 for a special exception. Those criteria stated that the business had to be reasonably necessary for public convenience and welfare and not detrimental to the neighborhood. There also was no limit to the neighbors' veto power. Thus, the Board committed legal error in violation of the businessman's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the county and county employee were entitled to immunity under the act as the case did not involve governmental negligence in the operation of motor vehicles, public buildings, or the discharge of pollutants. As plaintiffs did not allege that they suffered property damage, bodily injury or death, they did not seek recovery for the kinds of injuries covered by the act. The court found that plaintiffs failed to allege that any specific conduct on the part of the county employee was willful and malicious or constituted wanton negligence; therefore, he could not be stripped of statutory immunity. The court held that because plaintiffs sought to hold the county liable solely on the theory of respondeat superior, they failed to state a &sect; 1983 claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the definition of &quot;robbery in the first degree&quot; as set forth in 11 Del. C. &sect; 832 was imprecise or vague so that his due process rights were violated by his indictment. The court overruled defendant's motion. The essential inquiry was whether defendant reasonably should have known that using force with the intent to overcome a store employee's resistance to his theft of store merchandise and in so doing, causing physical injury to the employee, constituted robbery in the first degree. The court determined that a person of reasonable intelligence should have known that those actions constituted robbery in the first degree. Thus, it found that &sect; 832 was not unconstitutionally vague. Defendant further claimed that his sentence was not being carried out according to law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, association and employee, filed an action in State superior court (Delaware) for declaratory relief against defendants, State and a school district. Plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment arguing that there was no factual dispute regarding the retroactive application of an amendment of 14 Del. C.&sect; 1318 to annual and sick leave benefits already earned. The State filed a cross motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to the amendment, there was no statutorily prescribed formula governing the method of calculating or paying school employees for accumulated annual leave upon their retirement. The amendment mandated that a higher divisor be used in calculating both sick leave and annual leave. The effect was to lower the accumulated annual leave and accumulated sick leave benefits that those districts which previously used a lower divisor would pay to their personnel upon retirement. The State contended that the payment for unused annual and sick leave under14 Del. C.&sect; 1318 was available only to those persons who reached retirement eligibility. The court granted the State's motion in part, but otherwise denied the motions. It noted that the employee had not retired nor was he eligible to receive a pension when he left the school district, and was not entitled to the accumulated sick leave benefits. Under the past practice of districts, employees were entitled to an accumulation of annual leave benefits prior to retirement, but the issue of payment of accumulated leave was hotly contested. The court concluded that such material and genuine factual dispute prevented summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant owner challenged an order of the Board of Adjustment of the City of Dover (Delaware), which affirmed the decision of respondent City's Director of Planning and Development that the owner's retail store was not in compliance with Article 5, &sect;13 of the Dover, Del., Zoning Ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City found that the owner's store was an &quot;adult entertainment establishment&quot; under Article 12 of the Dover, Del., Zoning Ordinance and was not located at least 500 feet from a residential area as required under Article 5, &sect; 13 of the Dover, Del., Zoning Ordinance. The Board affirmed the decision. On appeal, the owner argued that the Ordinance was vague and overbroad. The court held that the ordinance was applicable to the owner. The provisions of Article 12 of the Dover, Del., Zoning Ordinance were not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague and were narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. The court construed the Ordinance so as to limit its application to only those adult entertainment establishments that caused undesirable secondary effects of crime, prostitution, and the problems associated with adult entertainment. The Ordinance was clearly intended to restrict those entities distributing sexually oriented materials where such distribution would be such as to adversely impact the surrounding residential community. It provided a manner in which a person of common intelligence could determine whether or not an establishment would be in violation.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the jury instructions concerning the percentage of illness attributable to cigarette smoking were correct and that the corporation was not entitled to an instruction on comparative negligence. The corporation also moved to strike plaintiffs' claims and prayers for punitive damages and that motion was granted. The court noted that punitive damages were intended to punish and deter. The court found that the imposition of previous awards had already accomplished those goals. The court noted that due to the corporation's financial condition, further punitive awards would contribute to a likelihood that future litigants would not be able to collect damages from the corporation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of intentional murder in the first degree and felony murder in the first degree. The State gave notice of its intent to prove three statutory aggravating circumstances: (a) 11 Del.C.&sect; 4209(e)(1)b (to avoid arrest); (b) 11 Del.C.&sect; 4209(e)(1)g (prevent witness testimony); and (c) 11 Del.C.&sect; 4209(e)(1)j (felony murder).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">By finding defendant guilty of felony murder, the jury already determined the existence of &sect; 4209(e)(1)j, as an aggravating factor, that the murder was committed while defendant was fleeing after committing a felony, a rape. At issue was whether there was sufficient evidence to permit jury consideration of 11 Del.C.&sect; 4209(e)(1)b. - a murder to prevent arrest or effect an escape and 11 Del.C.&sect; 4209(e)(1)g. - a murder to prevent testimony by a witness to a crime. By looking at the Florida interpretation of the statute, the court held that under &sect; 4209(e)(1)b, where a policeman was not the victim, the State had to be able to point to evidence which supported the theory that the motive was to prevent arrest. Under &sect; 4209(e)(1)g, the person must have been killed for the purpose of preventing that person from testifying. The only evidence was an inference that the victim was killed as a consequence of the immediate flight from a felony. Any inference that he was killed to prevent his testimony was purely speculative as the victim of the rape was not killed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State was barred from using the killing as a statutory aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee filed a claim for unemployment benefits and collected regular benefits for 26 weeks. When the first benefit year expired he filed a second claim to collect another 26 weeks of benefits. A claims deputy determined that he was ineligible to receive benefits. An appeals referee found that the employee not meet the prerequisite of being monetarily eligible under 19 Del. C. &sect; 3314(5)(b) and affirmed the decision. The Board adopted the referee's conclusion. On appeal, the employee argued that &sect; 3314(5)(b) was unconstitutionally discriminatory. The court held that the employee failed to show that &sect; 3314(5)(b) was not rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose and failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality. 19 Del. C. &sect; 3313(j) limited the total benefits payable to a claimant to the lesser of 26 times the weekly benefit amount or 50 percent of the wages paid during the base period. 19 Del. C. 3314(5)(b) prevented claimants who lost one job from collecting benefits beyond the statutory period set out in 19 Del. C. &sect; 3313(j). Accordingly, 19 Del.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for the first-degree rape of his daughter and he filed a motion for relief asserting ten separate grounds for relief. Defendant also moved for additional discovery to support his claims for relief and filed a motion to expand the record. The court denied defendant's motion for relief to set aside his conviction and concluded that defendant had failed to carry his burden of proof and had not shown he was entitled to relief. The court found the statute under which defendant was convicted was not void for vagueness and there was no evidence that the prosecution had promised the victim money for her testimony. The court ruled that a supplemental charge to the jury was not erroneous or prejudicial since it was permissible to encourage the jury to reach a verdict. The court concluded that none of defendant's allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, such as failures to object to jury instructions, to the prosecutor's comments, and failures to investigate facts and the law regarding the indictment and defendant's pretrial motions, were not prejudicial since such breaches of duty did not affect the outcome.</SPAN></P>

He elected death by lethal injection days before he filed his third motion for postconviction relief. The court determined that because defendant was not eligible to raise the constitutionality of &sect; 4209(f) prior to signing the affidavit, his claims relating to the constitutionality of &sect; 4209(f) were not barred. The court held that &sect; 4209(f) was not unconstitutional because it authorized correction officials to use drugs, which federal laws considered to be controlled substances for use only by doctors' prescription. The court held that because the principal purposes of the federal drug control laws were to prohibit interstate drug trafficking, and &sect; 4209(f) was enacted to carry out the state's legitimate goal of capital punishment, it was not in conflict with federal law. The court further held that because the federal government utilized the same method of execution, it would have been incongruous to conclude that &sect; 4209(f) violated federal law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs brought separate claims against DART as a result of separate accidents involving plaintiffs and DART buses in which plaintiffs sustained injuries.

The court granted DART's motion, ruling that &sect; 1329 was constitutional because it found a rational basis for the legislature's decision to limit liability pursuant to &sect; 1329. The potential exposure to risks of loss was high because of the volume of people that used the DART buses on a daily basis. Thus, preservation of the public treasury against large tort recoveries was an important governmental interest that the legislature was attempting to protect by enacting &sect; 1329. The court concluded that the separate accidents for which plaintiffs brought separate claims did not constitute two separate occurrences. Rather, the collisions were the result of one continuous flow of events and thus constituted one occurrence within the meaning of &sect; 1329, thus limiting their total recovery to $ 300,000 rather than $ 600,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The contractor alleged that, pursuant to 10 Del. C. &sect; 3912 (Delaware), he was entitled to attorney's fees in his action to enforce a mechanic's lien. The court held that &sect; 3912 was unconstitutional because the property owner did not have the same right to attorney's fees if the property owner successfully defended an action to enforce a mechanic's lien. The contract between the parties was silent as to attorney's fees. The court held that no statutory authority existed to grant the award and that the contractor failed to set forth any legal basis for his request. The Delaware Supreme Court had previously declared unconstitutional that portion of &sect; 3912 that allowed attorney's fees for mechanic lien enforcement plaintiffs even in the absence of a contractual agreement for such fees, but denied the same right to defendants who were successful in such actions. The court held that the mechanic's lien provision in &sect; 3912 denied equal protection under the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">It was determined that 10 Del.C.&sect; 3912 permitted reasonable attorneys fees in a mechanic's lien case but only for a plaintiff if the plaintiff prevailed. The court overruled the motion because allowing attorneys fees to be awarded only to the successful plaintiff was unconstitutional. Plaintiff argued that because the legislature amended &sect; 3912 in 1991 and incorporated in the amendment the same language that was found unconstitutional, there was evidence of an intent on the legislature's part that the statute should be enforceable. The amendment changed the maximum assessment for attorneys fees from 5 percent to 20 percent. No one argued that the amendment was to accomplish anything else. Thus, the discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional problem remained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a capital murder penalty hearing, defendant challenged a jury verdict that recommended the imposition of a death sentence on him upon his conviction for a felony murder that occurred during a robbery attempt in which a store clerk was shot and killed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a jury verdict recommending the death sentence upon his conviction for felony murder. Defendant contended that only circumstantial evidence placed him at the scene of the murder with a gun in his hand. Defendant also argued that no evidence existed that he fired the fatal shots or expected that violence would erupt in the course of the attempted robbery in which the death occurred. Defendant and two other men attempted to rob a store and the store clerk was shot dead during the robbery attempt. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty of intentional murder. Defendant was, however, convicted of felony murder based on circumstantial evidence showing that defendant and another Hispanic male were seen running from the store and defendant appeared to have a gun in his hand. After weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the trial court rejected the jury recommendation and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment without benefit of probation or parole. The trial court held that the state failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was committed for pecuniary gain or that defendant demonstrated reckless indifference to human life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After weighing all relevant evidence in aggravation or mitigation, the court imposed a felony murder sentence of imprisonment for the remainder of defendant's natural life without benefit of probation or parole. The court concluded that the factual determinations failed to support a sentence of death, and the death penalty was disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer motioned for reargument of a decision of appellee county board of assessment review (Delaware) and sought damages for the violation of its constitutional rights to due process and equal protection of law pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1988. The board motioned to strike the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1988 counts on the grounds that the court lacked appellate jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer filed an assessment appeal to the board, alleging that its property was substantially over-assessed. Following a hearing, the board reduced the assessment value slightly to reflect a revised capitalization rate, but made no comment on other evidence of overvaluation. The taxpayer argued that the board's decision was not supported by competent or substantial evidence. The court was satisfied that the taxpayer produced competent evidence of overvaluation under both the cost approach and income approach methods of valuation. The board clearly erred in failing to consider or comment on the evidence. However, the court agreed with the board that it could not consider the taxpayer's civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, 1988. The issues were not first raised before the administrative tribunal, and a challenge to state tax administration was not maintainable if state remedies afforded full and adequate relief. The court also held that the taxpayer's civil rights claims were not sufficiently substantial to warrant an award of fees under the Civil Rights Attorneys Fees Award Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the taxpayer's motion for reargument because the taxpayer's civil rights claims were not within the board's statutory authority or within the court's appellate jurisdiction. However, the court agreed that the board erred in failing to consider or comment on the taxpayer's evidence of assessment overvaluation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant insurer sought judicial review of decision of by an arbitrator in favor of appellee insurer. Appellee moved to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant insured the driver allegedly responsible for an automobile accident. Appellee insured the injured driver. Appellee paid the injured driver's medical expenses and lost wages. It then filed for intercompany arbitration on its claims against appellant, alleging that its insured was responsible for the accident. Appellant failed to appear at the arbitration hearing, although it had been notified of the hearing date by certified mail. No file was ever received from appellant. A judgment was entered in favor of appellee, after it presented a prima facie case. Appellant sought an appeal de novo in the Superior Court. The court found that under 21 Del. C.&sect; 2118(g)(3), the dispute between the insurer was subject to mandatory arbitration. Because the statute was silent as to the right of an insurer to appeal the decision of an arbitrator, the silence was fatal to any claim to a right of appeal. The fact that such a right to appeal to a court was provided when one of the parties was a self-insurer was not dispositive, because in that situation, either party could appeal. In the instant case, neither party had the right to appeal the arbitrator's decision to Superior Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Decedent was parked under a tree that was on land owned by the city and county and operated as a park area when a branch of the tree fell off, crushed the car, and killed the decedent. The survivors contended that the city and county had been negligent in their duty to maintain the tree and also contended that the city and county had denied decedent his civil rights. The court determined that the city and county had no duty to maintain the trees. The court found that the duty to inspect the trees was discretionary and that the failure to perform the duty did not result in liability. The court determined that the survivor's allegations of a civil rights violation passed the threshold of the city and county's motions to dismiss. The court determined that the motions were more analogous to a motion to a judgment on the pleadings and were therefore premature. The court granted the motions to dismiss of the city and the county as to all but the civil rights claims.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the motion because the determination of the status of non-addiction of a defendant, to be sentenced for the manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled Schedule I or II narcotic drug, was a particularly serious matter for the court to adjudicate, given the requirement of &sect; 4751 that a mandatory minimum of six years, and twelve years for a prior conviction, be imposed. In cases adjudicated under &sect; 4751(c), expert psychological and/or medical testimony, depending upon which parts of 16 Del.C.&sect; 4701(1) the State sought to negate, were required in order for the State to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, a status of non-addiction of defendant.

In granting the motion to suppress, the court held that defendant's husband voluntarily gave proper consent to search their house. The subsequent seizure of defendant did not violate her constitutional rights. However, defendant's arrest violated Delaware statutory law.

The decision to reprimand the doctor was preceded by a hearing on notice that resulted in written findings and conclusions. The court affirmed the medical board's decision because it was supported by substantial evidence. The court noted that the medical board was under no compulsion to accept the testimony of a proffered expert, that the doctor's due process rights had not been denied by the hearing procedure because he was afforded notice and an opportunity for hearing, the doctor was not prejudiced by delay in bringing the proceeding, the failure to request permission for discovery obviated the need to respond, and there was no evidence of bias.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with second-degree burglary and multiple other charges. He pled guilty to second-degree burglary and admitted to violating his probation in exchange for the State's agreement not to prosecute the other charges. In response to the trial judge's questions during the plea hearing, defendant stated that he understood that he was voluntarily making the plea and that he was waiving certain rights. He said he was satisfied with defense counsel and that he was pleading guilty because he had in fact committed burglary in violation of his probation. During a hearing on sentencing and defendant's status as a habitual offender, he was declared a habitual offender and was sentenced to life imprisonment. In denying defendant's motion, the court rejected his claim that he was deprived of his due process rights at the habitual offender status hearing. The record showed that defendant knew of the State's intent to file a motion to declare him a habitual offender, that there was a factual basis for the State's motion, and that his rights were protected. The record of the plea hearing belied defendant's assertion that his guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty to a charge of trafficking in cocaine. As part of his plea agreement, the court sentenced him to the statutory minimum of three years in prison. Defendant asked the prosecutor to ask the court for a reduction in sentence due to his cooperation with the government under 16 Del. C. &sect; 4753A(c) (Delaware). The State declined to do so, and defendant filed his motion for postconviction relief. The court denied the motion. The court held that the prosecutor did not abuse his discretion under &sect; 4753A(c) because there was no bad faith or overreaching. Defendant's plea agreement showed that he agreed to plead guilty to a trafficking count in exchange for the State's entering a nolle prosequi on the remaining counts. The agreement explicitly provided that the State would recommend a sentence of the minimum mandatory term of three years. The court also rejected defendant's claim that his right to equal protection had been violated because there was no evidence that the prosecutor had a discriminatory purpose in refusing to move the court to reduce his sentence below the three-year minimum mandatory term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant moved for postconviction relief pursuant to Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 after being convicted of trafficking in cocaine, possession with intent to deliver a narcotic Schedule II controlled substance, conspiracy in the second degree, and resisting arrest. The Delaware Supreme Court issued an order affirming the judgment of the Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's first claim was that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the essential element of &quot;possession&quot; as to the possession with intent to deliver and trafficking charges at trial. However, the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence was ruled on and decided adversely to defendant on direct appeal. Therefore, that ground was barred pursuant to Superior Court Criminal Rule 61(i)(4) because it was formerly adjudicated. In addition, the element of &quot;possession&quot; was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Consideration of the claim was not warranted in the interest of justice. The court rejected defendant's argument that he was improperly sentenced on the possession with intent to deliver charge because the Delaware State Legislature declared 16 Del. C. &sect; 4751&nbsp;unconstitutional. Under the Truth in Sentencing Act of 1989 the section was repealed and replaced. The new &sect; 4751 applied only to offenses on or after June 30, 1990. Because defendant's offense occurred in November of 1989, he was properly convicted and sentenced pursuant to the previous &sect; 4751. Defendant failed to present a colorable claim that a miscarriage of justice occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner landowners appealed from a decision of the City of Wilmington Board of License and Inspection Review (Delaware), and sought a petition for a writ of prohibition against respondents, a city and a commissioner, with regard to the landowners' failure to comply with 2 Wilm. C. &sect;45-82(a) (Delaware) for refusing correct a problem of dead wood in trees located adjacent to their land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city advised the landowners that four oak trees located on city property adjacent to their property contained dead wood, and that the situation had to be corrected. The landowners appealed the citation, challenging the validity of &sect; 45-82. The board determined that the constitutional challenge was not appropriate for it to consider and denied the appeal. The landowners filed for a writ of certiorari in Superior Court, arguing that application of the ordinance to the landowners was a taking of their property without just compensation. The court held that &sect; 45-82 fell within the broad police powers granted to the city pursuant to the Home Rule Statute,&nbsp;22 Del. C.&sect;&sect; 801-836, and adopted by the city under its Home Rule Charter, 1 Wilm. C. &sect; 1-101 (Delaware). The purpose of the ordinance at issue was to protect the health and safety of the public, and the requirement that landowners remove dead limbs from trees on adjacent land substantially advanced that purpose. The ordinance did not constitute a physical invasion of the landowners' property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state indicated it would seek to introduce as non-statutory aggravating circumstances unadjudicated crimes of murder, robbery, and theft in other states, testimony by eyewitnesses of defendant's acts of violence, his avoidance of capture, and defendant's engaging in homosexual relationships to assist in avoidance of apprehension. Defendant argued that the evidence of the unadjudicated crimes could not have been used at the penalty phase as evidence of aggravating circumstances justifying capital punishment. The court held that the evidence of the prior, unadjudicated crimes was admissible if it was plain, clear, and convincing because of the potential impact of the evidence of the unadjudicated crimes. His confession to one of the prior murders was certainly admissible as it could have been used against him at a trial on the current charges. However, the evidence of the homosexual relationships to assist in avoidance of apprehension was not admissible, as it was unduly prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In its Order of Reference, the court had stated that the standard of review for the Special Discovery Master's decisions would follow that of a United States Magistrate, and thus were reversible only if the order was clearly erroneous or contrary to law. After the parties had briefed the issue, the court held that the master's decisions were to be reviewed de novo. The court found that the exercise of judicial authority under the Delaware Constitution was limited to those appointed by the governor and confirmed by the senate. Pursuant to Super. Ct. Civ. R. 113-123, a master was required to prepare a report, not an opinion. The parties could except to the report, and the master could amend it. The court found that the rule did not specifically define the standard of review for the master's decision, but the use of the word &quot;report&quot; and the review procedure suggested that the master's decisions were meant to be advisory recommendations, not binding judgments. The court held that the master had no independent power of adjudication, and without confirmation and adoption by the court, his acts had no force or validity.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had been convicted on charges of robbery in the first degree, Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 832; possession of a deadly weapon by a person prohibited, &sect; 1448; two charges of possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony, &sect; 1447; and two charges of murder in the first degree, &sect; 636.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court denied defendant's motion for postconviction relief. The court determined that defendant elected to be hanged, and that death by hanging was the method of execution when defendant was originally convicted and sentenced. Therefore, the court reasoned that defendant had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of the lethal injection procedure. The court then found that defendant agreed that his argument that death by hanging was &quot;cruel&quot; within the meaning of the Delaware Constitution had been foreclosed by a prior case. The court then found that although defendant produced historical references that some executions by hanging did not result in instantaneous death, his submissions did not establish that his own execution by hanging would involve unnecessary torture, unneeded terror, pain, or disgrace, a lingering death, or that it was so susceptible to accidents as to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to possession of cocaine. He elected to be treated under the first offender's program in 16 Del. C. &sect; 4764.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's offense occurred before the new first time offender's program under &sect; 4764 went into effect. However, the repeal of the old &sect; 4764 was imminent because the governor had already signed the new legislation before defendant committed his offense. Defendant asserted that he should be sentenced under the old &sect; 4764 because the legislature did not intend to apply the new &sect; 4764 retroactively. The court agreed. The court held that there was no clear language that the legislature intended to apply &sect; 4764 retroactively. Therefore, the court had to determine whether a retroactive application would create an unconstitutional result. The new &sect; 4764 imposed enhanced penalties if a person later committed a drug offense. Further, the new &sect; 4764 required a person electing the program to pay the costs of prosecution. Therefore, the court concluded that the potential of facing an enhanced jail sentence coupled with the imposition of costs of prosecution under the new law would create an unconstitutional result, if imposed on defendant.</SPAN></P>

He was also sentenced to incarceration; the sentence and fine were suspended. Defendant argued that part of one surcharge and all of a second surcharge were unconstitutional under the Ex Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant committed his crime, the surcharge on the fine imposed on him required by the Victim Compensation Fund pursuant to 11 Del.

C. &sect; 4802(a), a 15 percent surcharge went into effect for the Drug Rehabilitation Fund. According to the court, laws were ex post facto where they changed after commission of crimes the respective punishments and inflicted greater punishments than the law applicable without the change to the respective crimes when committed. The court held that the three percent increase and the new 15 percent surcharge were unconstitutional in defendant's case as ex post facto laws. The court refused to uphold the new and increased surcharges by distinguishing the surcharges from the fine as penalties; the court wrote that the distinction between penalties and fines for jurisdictional purposes was irrelevant to deciding whether or not defendant had been disadvantaged by a change in the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had pleaded guilty to tampering with public records and felony theft regarding funds from accounts of a court of common pleas. Defendant had agreed to make restitution, was performing community service, and had sought to have some of her community service applied toward her restitution. After a verification of defendant's community service hours, it was determined that she had overstated her hours. Defendant was offered an increased payment amount, alleged that she had been advised that her conduct had constituted new charges, and was thereafter charged with falsification of her records. The court held as an initial matter that the crux of defendant's defense was that she was vindictively or selectively prosecuted. The court observed that a similar case against another individual had been begun shortly prior to the discovery of defendant's conduct. In addition, the court held that defendant had failed to make a showing of bad faith by the prosecutor and that he had had broad discretion in determining the charges. Defendant had failed to make a showing of a colorable claim to entitle her to discovery that was not ordinarily available or to a hearing on her motion.</SPAN></P>

Almost four years after the accident, plaintiff sought damages from defendant for his head injuries.

Plaintiff claimed that his action was saved because defendant's insurance carrier failed to provide him with notice of the two-year statute of limitations, as required by 18 Del. C. &sect; 3914. The court denied defendant's motion. The court held that defendant did not overcome the presumption that &sect; 3914 was valid and that the Delaware Legislature's classification scheme under &sect; 3914 was rationally related to the purpose for which the insurance laws were intended. The court also held that the plain language of &sect; 3914 required defendant to provide written notice to plaintiff of the applicable statute of limitations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was convicted in December 1976 for crimes committed on February 24, 1976.

As the Truth in Sentencing Act (Act), which was enacted in 1990, related to all crimes committed as of 12:01 a.m., June 30, 1990, the court held that it did not apply to the inmate and denied his petition. In seeking a reargument, the inmate argued that fundamental fairness required that he be provided the benefits of the new guidelines, which reflected a new social awareness. The court held that even if there was a new social awareness, that was no basis to expand upon the actual wording of the Act, which was clear and unequivocal, leaving no room for statutory construction. The court also rejected the inmate's equal protection argument as he was treated under the law as it was in 1976 when he was sentenced exactly as others were treated with respect to the permissible range of years for the punishment imposed on the crimes committed. The court held that the fact that the inmate was then not able to take advantage of the Act's provisions did not mean that the Act's passage, including the transition provision, disadvantaged him.</SPAN></P>

The landowner filed suit in chancery court and then filed a motion to dismiss, or to transfer or stay plaintiffs' declaratory judgment action. The court granted the motion to dismiss and held that the declaratory judgment action was improper because (1) the landowner was a willing litigant, (2) the action in the chancery court already existed and presented a forum in which plaintiffs could present all of their claims and defenses, including for the prevention of future harm, (3) the declaratory judgment action was filed to gain a procedural advantage in anticipation of the landowner's suit, and (4) plaintiffs were not prejudiced by the dismissal of the action.

The tenant sought review, arguing, inter alia, that she was entitled to a law-trained judge. The court dismissed the writ in part and denied it in part, holding that the state constitution did not entitle litigants to a law-trained judge in a summary possession proceeding or in such a proceeding combined with rent or damages matters. Thousands of landlord-tenant disputes were heard in the Justice of the Peace Courts and the justices had a working knowledge of the law governing those matters.

The court held that the prohibition contained in &sect; 4199C(d) bore ample rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose and therefore was not violative of the Equal Protection Clause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The licensee was suspended for a period of five years, four of which were suspended for probation, after he admitted to violating 24 Del.C., &sect; 1731 by illegally obtaining insurance payments for medical services he never performed. He argued that the Board impermissibly commingled the roles of prosecutor and adjudicator in this case, thereby depriving him of his due process right to a fair and impartial determination of this matter and that his punishment was not supported by substantial evidence and was unduly harsh. The court affirmed the Board's order suspending the licensee. The court held that the choice of a penalty by an administrative agency, if based on substantial evidence and not outside its statutory authority, was a matter of discretion to be exercised solely by the agency. In light of the seriousness of the offenses admitted by the licensee, the punishment did not shock the court's sense of fairness. The court also found that the licensee had to overcome a presumption of honesty and integrity when asserting unconstitutional bias because the Board exercised both adjudicative and investigative duties, and that he failed to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Based upon defendants' claims the court determined that the questions to raised were (1) was the Delaware wiretap statute unconstitutional when it allowed an order to be issued if there is or was probable cause; (2) did the affiants' statements for the necessity of the wiretap meet the requirements of 11 Del. C. &sect; 1336; (3) did the wiretap order meet the specificity requirement of a search warrant; (4) was the Delaware wiretap statute invalid because it did not require minimization; (5) were conversations properly minimized during the eavesdropping; and (5) was the order invalid because it did not include a termination upon attainment of objective provision. The court concluded that State had established the necessity for a wiretap. The court also concluded that only one category of personal calls was not properly minimized. The court held that 11 Del. C. &sect; 1336 was not unconstitutional in that a specific ending date on the order was not required. The court further held that the provisions of &sect; 1336 were not to be strictly enforced in a manner that would prohibit the investigation of trafficking activity when there was an alleged conspiracy among defendants.</SPAN></P>

The defendant made a motion for judgment of acquittal with regard to the trafficking in cocaine charge. The defendant contended that &sect; 4753A violated his constitutional rights to be free from cruel and unusual punishment and, as applied to him, denies his constitutional right to the equal protection of the law. The court disagreed and denied the motion. Although just two weeks before the defendant's arrest &sect; 4753A had been amended to reduce the amount of cocaine needed to constitute the offense of trafficking in cocaine, the court ruled that the amendment was not so draconian as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff tavern patron brought an action against defendants, an off duty constable working as a security guard, a tavern, the Chief Constable and administrator of a county, and the county council. Plaintiff sought damages under state tort law and under federal civil rights law. The county defendants, Chief Constable and county council, sought dismissal or entry of judgment in their favor on the claims against them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff tavern patron claimed damages for personal injuries when he was shot by defendant, a county constable who was employed as a security guard for defendant tavern. Defendants, Chief Constable of the county and county council (county defendants), sought dismissal on plaintiff's claims under state tort law and federal civil rights law. The court held that the county had a duty with regard to the selection and supervision of constables. However, the lesser risk posed by constables was a significant factor in determining whether the requisite fault and causation had been established for liability under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Further, it had been held that a failure to run a record check before hiring a policeman who thereafter used excessive force did not show gross negligence or conscious indifference to the public welfare. The county defendants argued that they were immune under the Tort Claims Act, 10 Del. C. Ch. 40, from plaintiff's claims under state law. The court held that since the allegations against defendant county involved the exercise of discretionary functions, defendant county was immune. Summary judgment was granted in favor of the county defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the county defendants summary judgment, in an action brought by plaintiff tavern patron against defendants, constable, tavern, and the county defendants. The county defendants were not liable under either federal civil rights law or state tort law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During a sensational murder trial, the court ordered the names and addresses of jurors to be kept confidential and conducted the voir dire through the use of identification numbers. In a previous case, the publisher had obtained personal information about the jurors and published their profiles. The publisher sought to intervene and to have the confidentiality order vacated. The court granted the publisher's motion to intervene, holding that the publisher had a right to intervene to assert the public's right of access to information. The court denied the motion to vacate the confidentiality order. The court held that it had the right to keep jurors' personal information confidential under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 4513(a). Although it held that the order was not a prior restraint because it did not bar all access to information, the court held that its order was the least restrictive way to ensure a fair trial. The court identified juror privacy as a component of the defendant's right to a free trial, a compelling state interest. The court held that the jurors' right to privacy outweighed the public's interest in obtaining their identities and their answers to personal questions.</SPAN></P>

The commission voted to deny the application and the property owners appealed. The city commissioners affirmed the decision of the commission. On appeal, the property owners claimed that defendants' denial of their request constituted a deprivation of private property without due process of law and a taking of property without compensation in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV, Del. Const. of 1897, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1981, 1982 and 1983. They sought damages in inverse condemnation pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 29 &sect; 9504. The court held that plaintiffs' expectation of approval of their partitioning request constituted a property interest protected by procedural due process, however, the property owners were accorded all of the procedural safeguards regarding the consideration of their application. The record revealed no procedural irregularity, racial animus, or outrageous conduct on the part of defendants that rose to the level of a violation under &sect; 1983.

Physician argued, among other things, that the court should strike the patients' claim for punitive damages as unconstitutional as an excessive fine. The court allowed the punitive damages claim. It held that should the jury determine punitive damages were appropriate against any party, the court would then conduct a hearing with the same jury to determine the amount of such damages. Next, the court ruled that no evidence of settlement negotiations was admissible except to impeach physician because the risk of unfair prejudice to physician greatly outweighed any probative value of evidence regarding statements during settlement negotiations. Lastly, patients did not have a right to compel physician to produce his statements made while testifying before the Board of Medical Practice because such proceedings, pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 1734(b), were private unless physician requested that they be made public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Delaware corporation brought a suit for the Illinois corporation's breach of a lease agreement regarding real property in Illinois. The Illinois corporation sought dismissal, claiming the court lacked personal jurisdiction over the out-of-state corporation. The court disagreed, holding that: (1) the Delaware long-arm statute contained in Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3104 authorized jurisdiction over the Illinois corporation; (2) the 20-year lease agreement was originally executed in Delaware by an agent of a Delaware corporation affiliated with the Illinois corporation; (3) all monthly rental payments had been delivered in Delaware, all real estate tax bills for the property had been paid from Delaware, and all communications concerning the property were made in Delaware; (4) the Illinois corporation had sufficient minimum contacts with Delaware; (5) the Illinois corporation's conduct and connection with Delaware were such that it reasonably should have anticipated being haled into court there; and (6) the assertion of personal jurisdiction comported with traditional notions of &quot;fair play and substantial justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The principal filed a motion to strike or dismiss those claims, arguing that the application of those acts to conduct that allegedly occurred outside of Delaware was unconstitutional. The court denied the motion, and the principal filed a motion for reargument, which the court also denied. The court held that because there was no clear, single situs for the alleged wrongful acts, the law of the place of the injury, namely, Delaware, should have applied. This was in keeping, the court said, with Delaware's adherence to the lex loci rule for negligent torts. The court found that the conduct complained of had not occurred solely outside of Delaware because the agent had compiled the allegedly misappropriated customer list for the principal in Delaware and because Delaware was the place of the alleged economic injury. The court held that no constitutional violation would have resulted because the activities that gave rise to the action had not occurred wholly outside of Delaware.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the union's request for mandamus to compel the supervisor to negotiate those issues and found that, although the state act was analogous to rights granted to federal employees to organize under the Labor-Management Relations Chapter of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (LMA), 5 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7101, the Technician Act, as a matter of law, was a narrow exception to the LMA and, in addition, that union proposals containing binding arbitration provisions were nonnegotiable. The court held that the state act still required the employer to negotiate with the union, but that Del. Code Ann. tit. 20, &sect; 185 precluded it from negotiating certain aspects of the employment relationship that were covered by the state act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The car owner was a used car dealer located in Maryland, which did business with the Delaware dealer.

Although the owner was the car's owner at the time of the accident, there was no affirmative evidence of an agency relationship between the owner and the driver of the car. Rather, the owner intended to sell the car to the driver's father for sale on his lot, but had not yet transferred title to the automobile. The court also found that there was no jurisdiction under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3104(c)(4), which conferred jurisdiction on an out of state tortfeasor who engaged in a &quot;persistent course of conduct&quot; in the state, because the owner did not transact business in Delaware. His business was located in Maryland, and although he sold to Delaware residents, all the elements of the sales took place in Maryland. Thus the owner did not have a significant &quot;presence&quot; within Delaware to bring him within the reach of &sect; 3104(c)(4).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff contractor filed, pursuant to Del. Super. R. Ct. Civ. P. 15, a motion to amend the complaint in an action for a mechanic's lien against defendant partnership. The contractor also sought to add a claim for reasonable attorney fees pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3912.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">By the motion to amend, the contractor sought to cure in the original complaint, the failure to follow the time constraints of Del. Code Ann. tit. 25, &sect; 2711(a), the failure to name the individual partners as defendants, and the failure to include a metes and bounds description as required by Del. Code Ann. tit. 25, &sect; 2703. The court granted the motion to amend those portions of the original complaint. The court held initially that the motion to amend was timely filed under &sect; 2711(a) because the motion was filed within the period of time that began 90 days after the contractor completed the work but before 120 days had passed from the completion of the work. Next, the court did not apply the relation back doctrine, which because the original complaint was untimely filed under &sect; 2711(a) would have caused the amendment to be untimely. The court held that the amendment cured the defects in the original pleading because the amendment was timely filed, the amendment named as parties the individual partners, and reference to plot plans was sufficiently clear enough of a description of the property to have been subjected to a mechanic's lien.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the contractor's motion to amend the complaint in the action for a mechanic's lien against the partnership. The court however denied that part of the motion, which sought to add a claim for reasonable attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied defendant doctors' renewed motion for psychiatric examination of plaintiff with prejudice. The Court pointed out a related issue of whether psychiatric opinion dealing with the credibility of a witness or party would have been admissible at trial regardless of the basis of that opinion. The court held that an examination may have been required upon a showing of good cause where a physical or mental condition of a party was an issue in the case. The court found that defendants were not entitled to have plaintiff examined by a psychiatrist. The court concluded that defendant's claim that plaintiff was not competent to maintain this suit was embarrassing, especially since defendant, at oral argument, agreed that plaintiff was competent to practice medicine and held that there were not good grounds for the affirmative defense of lack of mental capacity of plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

Code tit. 10, &sect; 4011(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The minor argued that Del. Code tit. 18, &sect; 6511 acted to waive immunity in that the city had insurance for such accidents. The court held that sovereign immunity by &sect; 6511 was ineffective and because the city's coverage was not within an existing state insurance coverage program, its immunity was not waived by &sect; 6511. In looking to Del. Code tit. 10, &sect; 4011(a), the court held that except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, all governmental entities and their employees would be immune from suit on any and all tort claims seeking recovery of damages. However, &sect; 4011(a) allowed tort suits pursuant to the ownership, maintenance or use of vehicles, machinery or equipment, and in this case, that definition included the electrical utility poles at issue. Therefore, the city could be held liable in a tort action pursuant to &sect; 4011(a).</SPAN></P>

The court found that immunity remained intact in the records and proceedings of the credentials committee because plaintiff had not sustained his burden of proving malice or bad faith, pursuant to &sect; 1768. The court did not find a waiver of the credential committee's privilege as to its deliberations. The court held that while the enactment of &sect; 1768 could have violated a strict interpretation of the separation of power doctrine, it was not an unconstitutional intrusion into the separate powers of the judiciary by the legislature. The court granted plaintiff's motion to strike defendants' third affirmative defense and awarded him reasonable attorney's fees in the preparation and presentation of its motion because there were no grounds alleged sufficient to challenge plaintiff's capacity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties entered into a ten-year commercial lease, where the lessee had the unilateral option to renew the lease for two additional five-year terms. Under the lease, the lessee was responsible for necessary structural, external, and internal repairs to the premises. The lessors brought the instant action when the lessee refused to commence repairs on the premises, estimated at $ 50,000. The Delaware Landlord Tenant Code, Del. Code Ann. tit. 25, &sect; 5303, imposed a duty on the lessors to repair and maintain the premises, notwithstanding provisions in the lease to the contrary. At issue was whether the statute should be retroactively applied to a long-term commercial lease that was entered into two years prior to the statute's enactment. The court noted that the Delaware Landlord Tenant Code, by its own plain language, was specifically concerned with maintaining and improving the quality of housing. Here, a long-term commercial lease was negotiated, drafted and executed by sophisticated businessmen standing on both sides of the contract. The court held that application of the statute to the pre-existing lease would constitute an unconstitutional impairment of contract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the lessee's motion for summary judgment because the Delaware Landlord Tenant Code did not retroactively apply to the lease between the lessee and the lessors.</SPAN></P>

The court denied their motion and, after balancing all of the competing interests, held that the state's compelling interest in apprehending and deterring drunk drivers outweighed the minimal intrusion on defendants' constitutional rights and that the sobriety checkpoints did not violate U.S. Const. amend. IV. The checkpoint stops advanced an important state interest in pursuing methods to eliminate drunk drivers from its roads because the stops had a substantial deterrence value, and the court rejected defendants' arguments that the roadblocks were invalid because they were less effective than roving patrols at eliminating drunk drivers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was previously involved in an automobile accident in which the driver of the other car was killed. After the accident, defendant was arrested on a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol. Following the administration of an intoxilyzer test, defendant was arrested for criminally negligent homicide in violation of Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 631. Defendant's motion to suppress the results of the intoxilyzer test was granted. The state certified that the suppressed evidence was essential to its prosecution, and the action against defendant was dismissed. The state filed multiple appeals pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 9902(c), and defendant was ultimately reindicted on the criminally negligent homicide charge. The court, after considering the prejudice claimed by defendant, granted defendant's motion to dismiss the reindictment. The court noted that the state's appeals were an attempt to unfairly manipulate the criminal process, and that such appeals resulted in at least a two and one-half year unnecessary delay in bringing defendant to trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was twice before indicted for criminally negligent homicide. Both times, the trial court had granted defendant's motions to suppress evidence, the state had certified that the evidence was essential to its case, and the trial court had dismissed the action pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 9902(b) so that the state could appeal the grant of defendant's motion. The state supreme court affirmed the trial court's second suppression order and dismissal. When the state reindicted him, defendant filed a motion to dismiss, arguing, inter alia, that there was insufficient evidence to support the charge and that reprosecution was barred by Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 207. The court granted defendant's motion to dismiss. The state's certifications that the suppressed evidence was essential were binding judicial admissions; therefore, the state could not reprosecute defendant for the same charge based on the same evidence it had when it made the certifications. The court concluded that Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 207(1) barred reprosecution because dismissal pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 9902(b) was the equivalent of a determination that there was insufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>

Appellant asserted that there was no basis for requiring it to pay gross receipts tax as a food processor. The court affirmed the decision of the tax appeals board, holding that the board's analysis was correct. The court noted that the inquiry of whether a foreign corporation was doing business involved three different considerations: was the foreign corporation doing sufficient business in the state to: (1) extend the state's regulatory power over it; (2) provide sufficient nexus for jurisdiction for service of process; and (3) grant the state power to tax its activities? The court found that appellant was in Delaware of the pursuit of profit through the sales of its meat products. The court concluded that a sufficient connection with the state to warrant the imposition of the business license and gross receipts tax was evidenced by the record.</SPAN></P>

Defendants filed a motion to dismiss based on the statute of limitations found in Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 8127. The roofing materials supplier was voluntarily dismissed because of a defect in service.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The fire company's four-count complaint alleged breach of contract, breach of the roof bond and warranty contract, breach of the implied warranty of habitability, and breach of the implied warranty for fitness for a particular purpose. The contractor defendant argued that the cause of action existed only during the first six years after the date of completion. The court held that (1) &sect; 8127 began to run at the earliest of several designated dates, irrespective of the date of injury; (2) the discovery rule could not be used to create a cause of action for an injury discovered after the six-year period; (3) &sect; 8127 did not violate Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 or the Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses; (4) the favored statutory class was reasonably broad and encompassed persons similarly situated whose inclusion advanced a legitimate legislative goal, and there was a rational relationship between the provisions of Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 8127 and legitimate legislative objectives; and (5) the fact that the bond secured an express warranty that extended over a 20-year period did not remove the underlying contract from the statutory time limitation.</SPAN></P>
