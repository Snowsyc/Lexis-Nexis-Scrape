The teacher, as his coach, handled him roughly and was disciplined by the school district. Although the teacher was not dismissed, he was suspended without pay while the incident was investigated. The teacher appealed his suspension without pay, but both the adjudicator and the trial court asserted that they had no jurisdiction to consider the appeal. The court reversed, finding that jurisdiction existed under Iowa Code &sect; 279.27 because a decision to suspend a teacher, short of discharging him, was still a &quot;determination.&quot; The court next found that the school district and its superintendent lacked statutory authority to suspend the teacher without pay because to do so would be a punishment in advance of a hearing. Finally, the court ruled that the teacher should not have been assessed transcript costs on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Black Hawk District Court (Iowa), which imposed a sentence of a term not to exceed 10 years following his conviction for breaking and entering under Iowa Code &sect; 708.8 (1975), based on an earlier conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, which had been reversed, and a similar possession charge, which had been dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's previous conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver was reversed on appeal because of an illegal search, and an earlier charge of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver had been dismissed because a motion to suppress under the Fourth Amendment was sustained. In sentencing defendant for the breaking and entering conviction, the trial court expressly stated that the two possession cases were considered. On review, the court held that the trial court properly considered the prior charge and conviction in imposing the sentence. Upon a balancing of the divergent policy considerations involved, the court concluded that evidence should not be per se inadmissible in a sentencing hearing solely upon the basis that, if tendered at trial, it would be subject to exclusion on constitutional grounds. Therefore, absent some showing that the evidence in question was gathered in violation of defendant's constitutional rights and for the express purpose of influencing the sentencing court, the court declined to extend the exclusionary rule to the sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant complained of the trial court (Iowa) imposing a mandatory minimum sentence under Iowa Code &sect; 902.7 (Supp. 1977) upon his guilty plea to attempted murder. He argued that attempted murder was not a forcible felony, as required by &sect; 902.7 and defined in Iowa Code &sect; 702.11, and that Iowa Code &sect; 902.7 denied due process because it was vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered guilty pleas to attempted murder and willful injury based upon his shooting his wife and daughter, but he argued that attempted murder was not included among those crimes comprising an Iowa Code &sect; 702.11 &quot;forcible felony.&quot; Defendant committed an assault within every Iowa Code &sect; 708.1 definition of that crime. Defendant was guilty of committing a &quot;felonious assault,&quot; as listed in Iowa Code &sect; 702.11, which was a &quot;forcible felony,&quot; as required by Iowa Code &sect; 902.7. The court did not believe imposition of Iowa Code &sect; 902.7 required that defendant be specifically charged with a felonious assault; it was sufficient that defendant was charged with committing a felony that necessarily included an assault, as did attempted murder. A person of ordinary intelligence would have fair notice that attempting murder with a firearm would invoke the mandatory minimum sentence of Iowa Code &sect; 902.7. The court, therefore, held Iowa Code &sect; 902.7, examined as a sentencing statute, was not so vague as to deprive defendant of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant committed the offense before the enactment of the new criminal code but the trial took place after the effective date of the new criminal code. On appeal defendant argued that Iowa Code &sect; 4.13 required the trial court to sentence him under the new criminal code because it reduced the penalty. The new criminal code itself, however, contained provisions detailing its application to crimes committed before its effective date. Iowa Code &sect; 801.5(2)(b) (Supp. 1977) contemplated that defendant had to request sentencing under the new version and the trial court had to approve that request. The court held that &sect; 801.5(2)(b) controlled because it was more specific than Iowa Code &sect; 4.13. Because the trial court denied approval to defendant's request to have been sentenced under the new criminal code, defendant had no statutory right to have been so sentenced. Next, defendant asserted that his sentence of one year in the county jail was cruel and unusual punishment. The court disagreed and concluded that the punishment was not grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the mother's parental rights to her child were terminated, she appealed. The mother claimed that the application of Iowa Code &sect; 600A.8 (1977) to certain acts of hers that were admitted at trial and that took place before the effective date of the statute violated the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Iowa constitutions. On appeal, the court held that the ex post facto doctrine was intended to prohibit the application of a new punitive measure to conduct already consummated. The court found that the doctrine was limited to cases clearly criminal in nature. The court noted that termination of parental rights was not a punitive measure but a preventive or remedial one and was not intended for punishment of parents. The court held that the prior termination statute replaced by &sect; 600A.8 was not overly vague or unconstitutional on its face because it only required parents to provide the necessary parental care and protection to a child. The court noted that the mother was advised in a prior proceeding of what was required of her in order to keep her child. The court concluded that her conduct was therefore proscribed under the old statute, as well as by &sect; 600A.8.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant was guilty of robbing the desk clerk at a local motel while indicating he had a gun.

Crim. P. 27(2)(b) since his trial began on the 90th day; and that mandatory minimum sentencing was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. Theft required an additional element not required of robbery.

Upon review, the supreme court affirmed the judgment of the commission. A violation of an ethical consideration, standing alone, supported disciplinary action. EC 5-5 was not unconstitutionally vague. It plainly provided that a lawyer should have not drafted instruments naming him or her beneficially except in exceptional circumstances.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The maternal grandmother was awarded guardianship of the child with no notice to the father. The father brought an action seeking to terminate the guardianship. The lower court awarded custody to the grandmother with visitation to the father. Upon appeal, the court affirmed with a modification to the visitation rights. The court held that the father's due process rights were not violated as he had left the state in flight from the FBI. Even if the father had been afforded notice and returned, he could not provide a home for the child in the face of the probability of apprehension by the authorities. The state interest lay with providing for the care of the child in the immediate future. The father's absence made it necessary for the court to take some steps to assign legal responsibility for the child. The father's right to a subsequent evidentiary hearing on the guardianship appointment was statutorily insured by Iowa Code &sect; 633.37.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company sought certiorari, declaratory, and injunctive relief against an anticipated order from the state agency requiring the company to cease its pollution activities. The company contended that the statutes authorizing the order were unconstitutional because they did not provide for a notice or hearing before the issuance of an order. The statutes, however, provided for a post-order administrative contest proceeding. The court affirmed the judgment dismissing the company's petition for relief. The court determined that under Iowa Code &sect; 17A.19, the exclusive means for judicial review of an agency's action was after the exhaustion of all adequate administrative remedies and after a final agency action. The court concluded that the &quot;exclusive means&quot; language of &sect; 17A.19 precluded the use of common law writs. Because the company failed to show irreparable injury from exhausting administrative remedies that might otherwise be inadequate for its constitutional challenge, the court found that the company was not entitled to seek judicial relief prior to exhausting administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city was accorded the status of a special charter city. Claims against such cities were governed by Iowa Code &sect; 420.45, which required a notice of claim be filed within 30 days. Plaintiff did not file such a notice, but her notice of claim was given to the city within the 60-day period required by Iowa Code &sect; 613A.5, applicable to all claims against Iowa municipalities except special charter cities.The court noted that the city cited no special or unique needs of special charter cities which would explain or justify the differences between &sect; 420.45 and &sect; 613A.5, nor could the court conceive of any. Since the difference in classification of claimants resulting from &sect; 420.45 and &sect; 613A.5 was unreasonable and lacked a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest, application of the terms of &sect; 420.45 which were inconsistent with those of &sect; 613A.5, the statute of general applicability, constituted a violation of equal protection of the laws under both the state and federal constitutions. The court held that &sect; 420.45 was violative of equal protection to the extent that it applied a different time limitation to claims against municipalities than that set out in &sect; 613A.5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the 30-day notice requirement concerning claims against a special charter city, when claims against other cities had a 60-day notice, was a violation of equal protection rights, and reversed the order dismissing the plaintiff's claim against the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, the State's evidence showed that defendant operated a business involving the sale of sexual services. Three State witnesses were allowed to testify over defendant's objection that the spa had a general reputation as a front for prostitution. In instructing the jury, the district court defined prostitution as the performance of a sex act or acts for pecuniary gain. Defendant's objection to the instruction was overruled. Defendant was convicted of keeping a house of ill fame, and the conviction was affirmed. On further appeal, the court found that under &sect; 724.4, The Code, 1977, the State was authorized to introduce evidence of the spa's general reputation as a house of ill fame. However, the testimony did not meet the foundational requirements of State v. Hobbs. The court held that the Hobbs requirements were applicable under &sect; 724.4. The district court erred in overruling defendant's objections to the State's reputation evidence. Also, the district court erred in defining prostitution. It should have used the definition in &sect; 724.3, The Code, 1977.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission found that the real estate salesman took money from a trust account and applied the money to his own personal use without authorization from the owners of the funds.

The trial court affirmed the action of the Commission and found that &sect;&sect; 117.34(8) and (11) were constitutional. The court held that the statute was sufficiently definite to be understood by the salesman as a salesman subject to its proscriptions. Sections 117.34(8) and (11) were remedial and civil as applied in the case rather than penal in nature and needed, therefore, a less strict standard of definiteness. Iowa Code &sect; 117.46 placed a duty on realtors not to commingle their funds with trust account funds. This knowledge and notice lent certainty of definition to the terms in Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 117.34(8) and (11), which was attacked by the real estate salesman, so that a licensed broker or salesman knew when he violated &sect;&sect; 117.34(8) and (11).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The third company contended that the proceedings of the Board in approving the transfer and denying its unilateral application were defective in two respects: (1) The Board lacked jurisdiction to proceed with the transfer application of the first two companies because it had not published notice of the proceedings, and (2) the actions of the Board were illegal because they were unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious and were not supported by sufficient evidence. The court held that published notice under &sect; 325.13, The Code, applicable to new applications, was not a prerequisite for jurisdiction of the Board to consider a proposed transfer under &sect; 325.25, The Code, and that the Board had jurisdiction in the instant matter. The court rejected the contention that the Board erred in failing to give the third company's unilateral application due consideration; it stated that the Board gave the application more consideration than the statute required.

The court ordered that either the commissioners had to be elected by all qualified electors in the city or appointed by an appropriate public officer or body. The court held that plaintiffs had no standing to assert the unconstitutionality of &sect; 37.10 on the ground that it discriminated against non-veterans because plaintiffs were veterans.

The DEQ complaint accused petitioners of being in violation of the fugitive dust rule, Iowa Admin. Code r. 400-4.3(2)(c). The AQC found that petitioners violated the rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents claimed that petitioners were in violation of the fugitive dust rule because of a dust condition existing on a gravel road on the boundary between the two counties.

The ACQ sustained the decision and order of the hearing officer. Petitioners sought judicial review and the trial court dismissed the DEQ complaint. Upon further review, the court reversed the trial court's decree and reinstated the decision of the AQC. The court concluded that Iowa Admin.

The court agreed with the AQC that the travel on the gravel road was extraordinary. The dust was the proscribed material, so the rule's failure to enumerate specific materials was not unconstitutionally vague. The gravel road was within the scope of the fugitive dust rule even though it was not a construction haul road, based upon the plain language of the rule.</SPAN></P>

Defendant failed to show that prison conditions caused a lack of preparation for trial that was sufficient to justify a continuance, and he was not denied equal protection of the laws because his assignment to a noisy cellhouse fell within the scope of the legitimate state interest of security. The court also concluded that the trial court correctly overruled defendant's motion to dismiss because the imposition of a consecutive sentence for escape following the expiration of the life sentence that he was serving a for murder was not cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The truck in which the passenger was riding jackknifed and went into a ditch. The complaint alleged that the owners were negligent in failing to have the tractor and trailer equipped with proper brakes, allowing the driver to operate the unit with faulty brakes, and not keeping the semi-trailer under proper control. The owners and driver affirmatively asserted that the passenger was a guest in the truck within the meaning of the guest statute. The trial court held that the passenger was a guest as a matter of law, that the guest statute was constitutional, and that the driver as a matter of law was not reckless. On appeal, the court affirmed. The passenger did not provide any tangible benefit and was a guest as a matter of law. The United States Supreme Court had previously held that the guest statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Its summary dismissal of a 28 U.S.C. S. &sect; 1257 appeal was binding on the Iowa Supreme Court. The passenger never questioned the constitutionality of the guest statute under the state constitution and the issue was not preserved for appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court sustained defendant's motion to suppress evidence on the ground that narcotics officers violated Iowa's knock and announce statute, &sect; 751.9, The Code, 1977, by using a ruse to gain entry into defendant's house in the execution of a search warrant. The officers told defendant's wife that they needed to use the phone due to an accident down the road in order to avoid a possible attack by defendant's pit bulldogs. Once inside the home, the officers revealed their identities and purpose to defendant and to his wife, and they executed the search warrant. On appeal, the court reversed the dismissal of the prosecution, and sustained the writ of certiorari. The magistrate lacked the authority to dismiss a felony case with prejudice under &sect; 602.60, The Code, and reprosecution was not barred under &sect; 795.5, The Code, 1977. The time limitations of &sect;&sect; 795.1, 795.2 did not come into play, as defendant moved for and was granted a continuance. The suppression of evidence was in error under &sect; 751.9, The Code, 1977, which did not apply to an entry obtained by ruse because the officers did not &quot;break open&quot; a part of the house within the meaning of &sect; 751.9.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DOT argued that without the requisite permit, a billboard was subject to removal as a public nuisance without the payment of compensation. The billboard company against whom an injunction issued argued that DOT's action constituted an unlawful taking. The other company argued that the injunction was erroneous because DOT did not make the permit forms available in a timely manner. The court affirmed both judgments. The court held that &sect; 306C authorized the removal without compensation of improperly maintained advertising devices, that such removal did not constitute an unconstitutional taking, but was a valid exercise of the state's police power. Thus, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment that granted DOT injunctive relief as to one of the billboard companies. However, the court found that the other company attempted to comply with the law and file the requisite permit, but that the forms were not available from DOT within the prescribed time period. The court held that DOT did not have &quot;clean hands&quot; with respect to this billboard company, and thus, the court affirmed the lower court's denial of an injunction as to this billboard company.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the lower court erred in refusing to give the substance of defendant's requested instruction on its claim that the sole proximate cause of the accident was the negligence of plaintiff's employer. Defendant was entitled to have the requested instruction given to the jury because the proposed instruction stated the correct rule of law that was applicable to the facts of the case. Defendant had introduced evidence that plaintiff's employer violated defendant's departmental safety rules, and there was evidence from which the jury could have found that the sole proximate cause of the accident was the employer's violation of the rules.

The court reasoned that only one instruction was given explaining the operation of a motor vehicle as an element of the offense. The court determined that the challenged instruction informed the jury of the standard of proof, which was of crucial importance to the State. The court held that Iowa Code &sect; 785.16 (1977) was constitutional.

The court reversed the district court and reinstated the decision of the commission. The court was not bound by federal decisions in interpreting Iowa's Civil Rights Act. The court found that the exclusion in Iowa Code &sect; 601A.12, exempting &quot;any retirement plan or benefit system&quot; from sex or age discrimination provisions, was limited to retirement benefits and did not apply to group insurance plans. Because Iowa had an overriding interest under the Iowa Civil Rights Act to protect its citizens against sex discrimination, the court concluded that the controversy was not preempted by the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 151 et seq. In agreeing with the commission's finding of sex discrimination, the court concluded that the company could not justify the exclusion of maternity benefits by arguing that pregnancy was a voluntary condition.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's judgment for the taxpayer in its action challenging the imposition of the tax was reversed. The court held that the imposition of the sales tax on the services the taxpayer provided to out-of-state customers did not violate the Commerce Clause because there was no proof that the services were subjected to multiple taxation. There was no evidence that any other state imposed a tax on the information the taxpayer generated for its customers. As the taxpayer's services for its out-of-state customers were not exempt under Iowa Code &sect; 422.45(1), the department validly imposed a sales tax on the services.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was transferred to the district court for prosecution as an adult and then the State filed an information charging defendant with statutory rape. Defendant's demurrer to the charge was overruled. The court held that defendant's demurrer was properly overruled because the act was sufficiently described for purposes of a transfer hearing. The court also held that the identification of the crime committed did not irrevocably bind the prosecutor's subsequent &quot;proper action,&quot; when he sought to alter the information. The alleged violation was the rape of the named victim. Under &sect; 698.1, the offense could have been committed by force or against the victim's will, or by sexual intercourse with a female under the age of consent. The information, which alleged a violation of the same statute, did not charge a new offense. The court also held the trial court properly sustained objections to defense counsel's questions to the victim regarding prior sexual activity, and properly admitted medical evidence designed to elicit an examining doctor's opinion that the victim had sexual relations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The members of the Council were charged with criminal violations of an open meetings law, . The members of the Council filed a joint demurrer, alleging that the informations failed to state acts constituting a public offense and that Iowa Code ch. 28A (1977) was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court overruled the demurrer. The members filed a writ of certiorari to review the trial court's decision. The court held that Iowa Code ch. 28A (1977) was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Due Process Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV; Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 9, and therefore did not support pending criminal prosecutions against the members of the Council. Because Iowa Code ch. 28A (1977) did not specify what individual conduct was illegal, no individual would have known when involvement with a prohibited meeting became a criminal act. Iowa Code &sect; 28A.8 (1977) did not rise to the permissible level of a generally drawn statute to necessarily leave some definitional decisions concerning coverage to those potentially regulated. It made no reference to individual conduct and did not sufficiently specify what those within its reach must have done in order to comply.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 724.2 was constitutionally sound as applied to defendant because: (1) defendant did not have the requisite standing to attack it on vagueness grounds; (2) defendant failed her burden of proving discriminatory application because she did not establish that men were not prosecuted; (3) defendant failed to show that &sect; 724.2 prohibited a constitutionally protected activity as to her; and (4) the zone of privacy from governmental intrusion did not extend to the activities of prostitutes in playing their trade and regardless, defendant did not argue that her activity was conducted privately.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court permanently enjoined the owners from operating massage parlors in Iowa.

The term &quot;prostitution&quot; as used in &sect; 99.1 did not include the conduct at the massage parlors. Under Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 99.1 and 724.1 (1975) the term &quot;lewdness&quot; was fatally vague. The ordinance also contained a speedy remedy at law that was not shown to be inadequate. The trial court erred in finding that the massage parlors were enjoinable as a public nuisance under Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 657.1 and 657.2(6) because the conduct was not either injurious to the health, indecent or offensive to the senses so as essentially to interfere with the life and property of the general public within the meaning of the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another inmate entered the victim's jail cell, beat him, and forced him to have anal sex with another inmate.

Before trial, the State made a motion in limine to restrict defendant from discussing whether the victim filed or planned to file a civil suit against the county, its employees, defendant, or any other inmate based on the same incident. The State granted the motion over defendant's protest. At trial, defendant did not make any offer of proof regarding any actual or contemplated litigation.

Defendant did not pursue the matter at trial by making an offer of proof, therefore, the court was left to speculation as to whether such evidence even existed and if so, how it would have been used in the case. Because sodomy could be committed by mutual assent and the crime of assault and battery could not, assault and battery was not necessarily included within sodomy such that defendant's former conviction did not preclude a prosecution of him for sodomy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife sued the husband for the torts of alienation of affections and criminal conversation. The husband argued that both causes of action should be abolished as antiquated. On appeal, the court noted that both were relational torts recognized at common law. The gist of the tort of alienation of affection was wrongful conduct by a defendant, loss of affection or consortium, and a causal connection between such conduct and loss; intent to alienate was unnecessary. The gist of the tort of criminal conversation was adultery between a defendant and a plaintiff's spouse, which interfered with the exclusive right of one spouse to sexual intercourse with the other. The court held that retaining an alienation of affections tort was supported by public policy dictating that marriage relationships merited protection from outside interference. However, criminal conversation was a fundamentally flawed tort because the statutory right to maintain a civil action for adultery had been repealed. Therefore, the court abrogated the tort of criminal conversation as to conduct occurring after January 1, 1978. However, the husband's conduct was actionable because it occurred before that date.</SPAN></P>

The agency on a final administrative appeal then reversed the award of benefits. The district court then affirmed the agency's decision, and found &sect; 96.4(4) constitutionally valid. The district court noted that the employees had received their benefits for the second week prior to reversal of the award and such benefits could not be recouped pursuant to &sect; 96.6(2) because the award had been affirmed prior to its reversal.

The court held that &sect; 96.6(2) barred recovery of the benefits, making resolution of that issue unnecessary, while the district court's holding on the constitutionality of &sect; 96.4(4) was the law of the case.

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court noted that the persons exempted from jury service were not excluded from the list drawn by the jury commission. The court held that the inclusion in the jury list of persons exempt from jury duty under Iowa Code &sect; 607.2 did not invalidate the jury panel. Thus, the court ruled that defendant was not denied his right to an impartial jury. The court found that defendant's indictment was returned well within the three-year statute of limitations for the offense.

Such instruction was not necessary because the case against defendant was not wholly circumstantial; there was direct evidence with respect to defendant's possession of the drugs in question. The court further found that the search was conducted under a valid search warrant. Although there were some misrepresentations in the application for the warrant, there was nothing in the record to show that they were intentional. The court lastly found that because the information charging defendant treated hashish as another form of marijuana, the conviction of defendant on the second count was void.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended he should not have been charged under &sect; 321.78, The Code 1975 (Iowa) and tried as an adult. He argued that because he could have been charged under another statute having no exemption for juvenile proceedings, he should have been so charged. The court reversed for a new trial. It noted that, if some statute other than &sect; 321.78 was also violated by defendant, the prosecution was entitled to choose &sect; 321.78 and secure a conviction thereunder. The court found no abuse of prosecutorial discretion in so charging defendant. The court determined that defendant had a limited statutory right to trial by jury. He was under no obligation to effect a jury demand until an appeal trial date was specified. The court found that defendant was entitled to at least 15 days notice of the date fixed for trial so that he could, if desired, effect a &sect; 762.15, The Code (Iowa) jury demand at least 10 days before the time set for trial. It followed that the district court's failure to observe &sect; 762.12, The Code (Iowa) served in effect to unlawfully deny defendant his &sect; 762.15, The Code (Iowa) right to trial by jury.

The trial court held that the mother's objection, pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 17A.4(4)(a), was not effective to shift the burden to the Department to show that the rule was not unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious or otherwise beyond its authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother sought to prevent the Department from conducting an oral hearing on a proposed program change until it adopted procedural rules required by Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 17A.3(1)(b) and 17A.4(1)(b). When her petition was denied, she sought judicial review. The Department then promulgated Iowa Admin. Code &sect;&sect; 770-3.2(17A), -3.3(17A), and -3.4(17A). After her petition protesting the rule was denied, she again sought judicial review. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision as it related to rules for publication of notice and time limits for oral presentation because those rules were not unconstitutional on their face, as alleged. That part of the rule that provided that oral presentations could be held only in one location was reversed as it was contrary to the provisions of Iowa Code &sect; 17A.4(1)(b), which required the allowance of oral presentations when requested by 25 persons. Holding hearings only in one place precluded indigent persons from participating. Further, the rule exceeded the Department's statutory authority, in violation of Iowa Code &sect; 17A.19(8)(b). The Department had to prove the constitutionality of the rule because the statutory objections were sufficiently pleaded.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's claims. The court ruled that age was a proper factor to be considered in examining statutes related to sexual behavior, that the State had a significant interest in regulating sexual activity on the part of its young people, and that defendant's right to privacy as an adult could not be enlarged to include sexual conduct with a minor female in violation of the statute that fixed the age at which a minor could consent to sexual conduct.

The court affirmed the trial court's decision dismissing the Board's lawsuit against the Department for lack of authority and standing to sue. The county lacked the ability to mount a constitutional attack upon state legislative enactments. No original plaintiff alleged a sufficient personal interest or stake in the outcome of the controversy to insure that the dispute was presented in a concrete, adversarial context. A county and its ministerial officers had no right, power, authority, or standing to question the constitutionality of a state statute. The court affirmed the trial court's decision granting judgment against the bureau on the merits. The bureau did not have a vested interest in the value of property as originally fixed by the county assessor. The assessment placed a value for tax purposes upon the property, but the equalization raised or lowered the total valuation placed upon a class of property. An assessment was not an individual equalization and a property owner could not rely on an assessed value.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district by its board of directors voted to discontinue the teaching contract of the teacher. He then filed a petition in the trial court seeking reinstatement, damages for breach of contract, a writ of certiorari to compel the school district to provide him with various documents and records, and a declaratory judgment that the Iowa Code &sect; 279.13 (1973) was unconstitutional because it deprived him of procedural due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The trial court dismissed the teacher's petition and the teacher appealed. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case. The court held that the teacher did not have a constitutionally protected property interest in a continuing contract. The court found that the board was not only the sole judge but its vote was also decisive. It was not possible for the board to have been impartial. However, the trial court applied an erroneous rule of law in dismissing plaintiff's petition in view of the procedural due process provided for non-tenured teachers in &sect; 279.13. The court held that the non-tenured teacher was entitled under &sect; 279.13 to a hearing before an impartial board or tribunal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed the commission's ruling in her favor and exempted her from pat or strip searches and from assignments to the cell blocks. The court reversed. The court concluded that it was impossible to separate the CO II classification from the duties the female guard could not perform because they would put her in danger and violate the prisoners' rights. The court held that the prison should not be required to substantially adjust its physical plant or procedure in order to support the imposition of a classification. The court held that the men's prison had the right to discriminate against female guards on the ground of business necessity because such practice was necessary to the prison's safe and efficient operation and protected the prisoners' rights.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found the traffic ordinance allowing the use of the device unconstitutional because it violated the due process guarantees of Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The city appealed, and the court concluded that the citizen failed to meet his burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of the ordinance as applied to him. The court concluded that the due process test was satisfied because the seizure of the citizen's automobile served a significant governmental interest by assisting in the enforcement of traffic regulations, and a special need for prompt action existed. The court found that the citizen's vehicle had been found in violation of traffic regulations 10 times without satisfaction of the penalties involved at the time the device was attached to it. The court concluded that the seizure of the citizen's vehicle and postponement of hearing did not deny him due process where the city used reasonable efforts to learn the citizen's name and address and was unable to obtain it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With two pistol shots, defendant killed his lover when she told him that she intended to spend the night with another man. Under &sect; 690.3, The Code (Iowa), the trial court imposed a 70-year prison sentence on defendant's plea of guilty to second-degree murder. Inter alia, the trial court found that department of social services' statistics established a likelihood of release on parole within a few years, perhaps less than five, if a sentence of 50 years or less was imposed. On appeal, the court held that the sentence was not so disproportionately severe that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment. However, the court held that the trial court's attempt to influence parole possibilities was impermissible. Under the applicable sentencing statutes, particularly &sect; 690.3, the exclusive prerogative to determine defendant's minimum sentence rested in the parole board by reason of its sole authority to make parole decisions. By basing the length of sentence in part on a desire to lengthen the minimum sentence defendant would serve, the trial court sought to pass judgment on an issue foreclosed to the trial court and to prevent the parole board from deciding the issue at the proper time.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred by overruling his motion to dismiss the information based on &sect; 795.1, 1975 Code, which dealt with speedy indictment. The court found that defendant was never &quot;held to answer&quot; because there was no preliminary examination or waiver of same. However, defense counsel had assured the trial court that defendant was held to answer on July 6, 1976.

The trial court, on defendants' motions, dismissed the indictments. The court reversed and remanded. The clerk of court did not issue a precept to the sheriff.

On February 23, 1976, 10 members of the grand jury panel appeared, including at least six of the seven members of the first quarter grand jury. The record did not show whether the seventh grand jury member appeared on that date, but it did reveal that a panel member was selected to take the seventh member's place on the grand jury. Defendants were indicted by the first quarter grand jury as impaneled, except that a panel member was substituted for a grand juror. Regardless of the procedure used to notify the grand jurors to appear, so long as the grand jurors did appear and defendants were indicted by the reconvened grand jury as originally constituted, there would have been no basis for attack. Moreover, the substitution of grand jurors was not sufficient to set aside the indictments because defendant failed to show prejudice.</SPAN></P>

Ultimately, plaintiff corporation paid the judgment. Thereafter, plaintiff corporation filed suit, asserting that defendant corporation had tortiously interfered with its prospective business advantage by inducing the assignment of the judgment. The trial court sustained defendant corporation's affirmative defenses and entered summary judgment in its favor. Plaintiff corporation appealed. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case. The court found that plaintiff corporation's cause of action was not time-barred, pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 614.1(4), because the cause of action accrued upon payment, not assignment, of the judgment. Also, the court found that the cause of action was not barred by res judicata, pursuant to Iowa R. Civ. P. 29, because it could not have been raised as a compulsory counterclaim in the suit to enforce the assigned judgment. Finally, the court found that Iowa Code &sect; 639 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an order that dismissed plaintiffs' petition in a personal injury suit, plaintiffs sought review of the decision. The issue raised was whether Iowa Code &sect; 613A.5 was unconstitutional. The court reversed the dismissal of the son's petition against the county because &sect; 613A.5 insofar as it limited the son's right to file a late notice to 90 days was unconstitutional. It was held that for that purpose the son was entitled to 60 days after his incapacitation ended. The court also held that the period during which the son was incapacitated was a fact question to be determined at trial. Further, the court held that while the son did not file a notice with the county, the filing of his petition constituted substantial compliance with the notice requirement of &sect; 613A.5 if the petition was filed within 60 days after the termination of his incapacity. Additionally, the court held that the dismissal of the petition of both the son and his parents against the individual defendants was improper.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appeared for a preliminary hearing on May 19, at which time he was held to answer. The State elected to proceed by the filing of a county attorney's information as authorized by &sect; 769.2, the Code. On June 18, the State sought to present the information, but it was learned that all of the judges of the judicial district were attending a conference until June 20. On June 23, a Monday, the first day a judge was available in the county, the information was presented and approved 35 days after defendant had been held to answer. Defendant argued that the trial court had not established good cause for the delay within the meaning of &sect; 795.1, The Code. The court rejected this argument. Although judicial conferences were called on a somewhat regular basis, there was nothing to indicate that the prosecutor had been advised that all judges would be out of the district when the 30 days expired. Furthermore, the statute accorded only 30 days for prosecutors to submit and file county attorney informations. In view of the relatively short period involved, it was in no way unprecedented when an information was presented on the last available date.</SPAN></P>

The court found the challenged ordinance had three separate courses of conduct that were proscribed, and a violation of each course of conduct required an obstructive conduct. The court found the conduct proscribed in the ordinance was not broad because it did not restrict a person's right to freely come and go in public places. Finally, although it was possible to imagine factual situations in which the ordinance might be unconstitutionally applied, this fact alone did not make it unconstitutionally broad, as there were other factual situations to which the ordinance might be constitutionally applied.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the Commission was not. The union, which had intervened, appealed. The court affirmed the trial court. It held that members of the Safety Force were not firefighters for the purposes of Iowa Code ch. 400 and subject to that chapter's provisions relating to firefighters because their duties were broader and more diverse than those of police officers or firefighters. The court refused to consider a constitutional issue that was not raised in the trial court. It concluded that there was no indication that the legislature had intended that Iowa Code ch. 411 should apply to the Safety Force. Finally, the court found no inconsistency with the Iowa Const. art.

The proposed rates became effective under company bond pending a determination of their reasonableness and legality, but were subject to refund with interest in the event they were determined to be unjust, unreasonable, or unduly discriminatory. The court affirmed the commission's order denying the rate increase and requiring a refund, but also required the company to pay interest on the refund at the rate of nine percent per annum. Specifically, the court held that 1) the commission gave meaningful consideration under Iowa Code &sect; 490A.8 to the company's reproduction cost evidence; 2) the costs incurred by the company in establishing a continuing property record system were properly eliminated from the rate base because they were an expense; 3) the commission did not err in reducing the company's rate base by the amount of deferred income tax on the books of a non-regulated supplier; and 4) the double leverage theory was properly applied because the company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company.</SPAN></P>

During the two year period, the State attempted to rehabilitate the parents and provided them with social service assistance, but they made minimal improvements. The court held that &sect; 232.41(2)(e), under which the State sought to terminate the parents' rights, was constitutional. Its allowance of termination after the failure of &quot;reasonable efforts&quot; to correct the conditions leading to termination was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness.

Defendant appealed the denial of a jury trial. The court affirmed, rejecting defendant's claim that the bench trial requirement of Iowa Code &sect; 232.27 violated her constitutional rights under Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 9 because juvenile proceedings were not criminal proceedings and Iowa Code ch. 232 provided for adequate due process. The court rejected defendant's claim that &sect; 232.27 violated her constitutional right to a jury under Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 10 even though the literal language of that section appeared to be violated because juvenile proceedings were not in existence at the time Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 10 was adopted and application of the literal meaning would have done violence to the general meaning and intent of the provision. Thus, defendant was not entitled to a jury trial at her delinquency hearing under the Iowa Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted a default decree purportedly dissolving the marriage and awarded custody of the one child to the wife. The husband then sought to vacate and set aside the adjudication, alleging that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The husband's motion was sustained and the dissolution decree was set aside. On appeal by the wife, the court affirmed the decision. The court found that the wife's failure to comply with the one-year residency requirement pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 598.6 (1975) deprived the trial court of jurisdiction as to the dissolution proceeding.

I, &sect; 8, cl.3, had not been preserved for appeal. The court rejected plaintiff's argument that, since all 49 other states permitted sale of title insurance, it was unconstitutional for Iowa to refuse. Using its police powers, the State of Iowa was constitutionally entitled to preclude plaintiff's entry into the state to conduct certain business. The court found that the state legislature's exclusion of title insurers, as opposed to other types of insurers, had a rational basis and was meant to protect the public from invidious practices, such as rebates and commissions between institutional lenders and title insurance companies.

The court affirmed the conviction. Although the affidavit for the search warrant issued in New Mexico contained information obtained from a warrant issued in this state that was declared invalid, the New Mexico search warrant was not constitutionally invalid. The search warrant from this state was issued upon probable cause and was held invalid only because the required post-event notice was not complied with. The failure to comply with the procedures for the return of the search warrant did not serve to void the New Mexico search warrant. Regardless, there were sufficient facts to support a finding of probable cause. Thus, the motion to suppress was properly denied. The state was not required to establish corroborative evidence of the accomplice's testimony beyond a reasonable doubt. There was no evidence of either actual or probable prejudice caused by the presence of a revolver in the court bench drawer. Since defendant's motion to disqualify the prosecutor was premised on the possibility of calling him as a witness, the motion was premature and properly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed from a decree of the Jackson District Court (Iowa) for defendant Iowa Department of Revenue. The taxpayer had claimed that Iowa Code &sect; 450.51 and the Department's implementing rule, prescribing mortality tables as the sole basis for determining the value of a life interest and resulting inheritance tax, created an irrebutable presumption that violated the Due Process Clauses of the federal and Iowa Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's will provided for certain property to be placed in trust, with her cousin receiving the trust income for life. Upon termination of the life estate, a charitable institution was to receive the corpus. The value of the cousin's life interest in the trust was subject to inheritance tax. Decedent's cousin was 16 years old when the decedent died. In accordance with Iowa Code &sect; 450.51 and its own implementing rule, the Department computed the value of her life estate using mortality tables, which projected for her a 70-year life expectancy. However, the parties stipulated that her doctor would testify that because she suffered from cerebral palsy, she could not be expected to live beyond age 40. The taxpayer filed the instant suit. On appeal, the court noted that a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision narrowed the applicability of the irrebutable presumption doctrine to situations involving fundamental rights or important liberties where the classification did not meet equal protection standards. Inheritance tax legislation did not involve a fundamental right or important liberty. Further, no suspect classification was involved. Thus, there was no violation of due process.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the Iowa House had exclusive power over the election contest and that &sect; 53.17 was constitutional and dismissed appellants' petition. Appellants sought review and appellees filed a request for a cross-review. In affirming the trial court's order, the court held that the trial court properly dismissed the petition. The court determined that appellants' challenge regarding the House's decision to not count the intermixed ballots was not of constitutional proportions that would justify judicial relief. The court noted that the number of ballots that were invalidated were a small portion of the total number of valid ballots. The court stated that if the House validated all of the intermixed ballots that it would have given effect to bad ballots. The court found that there would not be any satisfactory answer without invalidating the entire election, which the court did not do. The court referenced the fact that the House acted as a court in election contests for its seats and that it was the proper body to determine the manner of handling the intermixed ballots.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was an Illinois corporation that did substantial business in Iowa and maintained six warehouses there but manufactured its goods elsewhere. Iowa imposed a tax upon the net income of corporations doing business in the state. The corporation used the single-sales factor formula in Iowa Code &sect; 422.33(1)(b) to determine its state income tax and to apportion the remainder of its net income. Corporation then applied a different, unapproved formula for computing income. State tax commission did not consent to its use and corporation appealed to the lower court. The lower court held that the Iowa single-sales factor formula was facially unconstitutional. Tax authority appealed and corporation cross-appealed. The court reversed the holding of the lower court on tax authority's appeal but affirmed its holding on corporation's cross-appeal. The court held that corporation did not carry its burden since it did not demonstrate that the Iowa single-sales factor formula was an unreasonable and arbitrary application in its case. The court held that Iowa Code &sect; 422.33(1)(b) was free from the constitutional infirmities asserted and that the trial court erred in holding otherwise.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state farmers argued that the trial court incorrectly granted the seed corn producers' motion to drop parties. The court overruled Bennett v. Eldon Miller, Inc. 252 Iowa 76, 106 N.W.2d 257 (1960), which the trial court relied on in holding that the state farmers were not members of a group which could maintain a spurious class action under Iowa R. Civ. P. 42(c). Under Bennett, a class action could not be maintained because 1) each state farmer had a complete, speedy and adequate remedy at law, and 2) the amount, which might be recovered by any particular state farmer, would differ from amounts recovered by other state farmers. Each state farmer's case was different and the relief sought would vary. The court disagreed and held that the fact that each state farmer might be entitled to a different sum in money damages would not furnish a basis for denying the class action by sustaining a motion to drop parties. Common relief could be sought despite the fact that individuals might recover separate judgments different in amounts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission adopted a rule establishing a 65-foot length limitation for trucks.

The court held that: (1) the state attorney general lacked authority to pursue the appeal on behalf of the DOT and commission without their approval, which was not given, because their disagreement over the appeal created a conflict of interest; (2) the motor club had standing to bring the action because the parties had antagonistic legal interests of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant declaratory relief; (3) in adopting the rule without complying with the Iowa Administrative Procedure Act, the DOT acted outside its authority under Iowa Code &sect; 307.10(5); (4) because the objectionable conditions of the rule were inseparable from the rule as a whole, the entire rule was void.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained defendant's &quot;motion to quash&quot; and demurrer on the basis the statute was violative of equal protection under both the state and federal constitutions. The State appealed this ruling. During pendency of the appeal, the court ruled in a separate case that the portion of Iowa Code &sect; 741.1, which had been challenged by defendant, was constitutional against equal protection challenge. Thereafter, the State dismissed its appeal and filed three new identical informations against defendant as the fourth charge was barred by the statute of limitations. Defendant filed a second motion to quash. The trial court sustained defendant's motion on the sole basis that the prior unappealed ruling was determinative of the constitutionality issue between these parties and the opinion in the other case did not automatically render the ruling in defendant's case incorrect.

Defendant made no constitutional attack to the imposition of repayment as a condition of his probation, but merely advanced the broad assertion that the trial court lacked the authority, absent a specific statute, to make any order for recoupment of court-appointed attorney fees.

On review, in the absence of any statutory definition of lewdness, the court gave deference to the discretion of the trial court. A prohibitory injunction could not be based on activity without specific definition as a nuisance. The mere fact that prostitution was mentioned in the same sentence of the nuisance statute could not serve to define the term or buttress the prohibition of undefined activity.</SPAN></P>

However, the court held that &sect; 714.37 was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad on its face so as to charge no offense. The court rejected defendant's argument that the statute was void for vagueness because the words &quot;obscene, lewd, or profane&quot; as used in the statute did not have a clear and precise meaning. The court held that &sect; 714.37 was not an obscenity or lewdness statute, but was a statute that prohibited outrageous conduct resulting in the intrusion into people's homes by means of telecommunications.

The court also held that the statute and rule were constitutionally applied to the facts presented in the case.

The court found that the testimony was patently hearsay and the testimony, which was offered to prove the ex-wife's alleged fear of defendant, was not admissible under the res gestae exception to the hearsay rule. Defendant's assault on his ex-wife was not so closely related, in point of time or place, nor so intimately associated with the homicide, as to form one continuous transaction.

The court first addressed the question of whether the enhancement of the free exercise clause by state-provided chaplains and religious facilities violated the establishment clause. The court held that it did not. The court noted that prisoners' retained rights of religious freedom included some reasonable opportunity to exercise their religion.The court held that the last clause of Iowa Const. art.

Of the five appointees, three were Iowa District Court judges at the time of their nominations. The senator and the State argued that the three appointees, who were District Court judges, were not eligible for appointment to the Iowa Court of Appeals under Iowa Const. art. V, &sect; 18, which stated that District Court judges were ineligible for any State office within two years after serving on the District Court. The senator further argued that the ineligibility of these appointees had the effect of invalidating the appointments of the other two appointees. The court held that the senator and the State were not entitled to apply Iowa Const. art. V, &sect; 18 to bar the appointees who were former District Court judges from appointment to the Court of Appeals because to do so infringed the rights of District Court judges as a class to equal protection. The court did not decide the constitutionality of &sect; 18 in any other application and did not decide whether, if the District Court judges were ineligible, the appointments of the other appointees were invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's conviction for first-degree murder, defendant sought review of the judgment. The issues raised on review were whether Iowa's statutory scheme for designating petit jury panels was unconstitutional, whether the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial, whether the trial court erred in quashing defendant's subpoenas that sought to require the prosecutor to answer certain questions under oath, and whether it was error for the state witness to answer a hypothetical question. The court held that defendant had not shown that the excluded class had any special perspective not attainable from the balance of the community. Additionally, the court found that defendant's claim that the jury panel was not representative of a cross section of the community was without merit. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a mistrial. Further, the court found that defendant's attempt to call the prosecutor as a witness was properly denied and that the admission of opinion evidence rested in the sound discretion of the trial court.

On sentencing, the trial court stated that it would have been more lenient if defendant admitted committing the crime charged rather than perjury himself. On appeal, the court remanded the case for resentencing. The court reasoned that the trial court's comments penalized defendant for demanding his constitutional right to a trial and for exercising his constitutional right not to testify against himself. It was permissible in determining the proper sentence to consider all pertinent matters, including the nature of the offense, the attending circumstances, defendant's age, character, and changes of reform. However, here the trial court based its sentence on an impermissible determining factor. The court found no compelling reason or demonstrated bias or prejudice by the trial judge that would necessitate a different judge on remand.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it was not inferable from the language in &sect; 713.24 that prospective application only was intended by the legislature.

Defendant contended that when insanity was established, it was presumed to continue and the burden was on the one who alleged a return to sanity. The court held that the presumption of continuing insanity ended on the restoration and a presumption of sanity returned under Iowa Code &sect; 783.2. The court held that defendant made remarks he wanted to suppress from a desire to placate his mother by exculpating his brother. They did not result from interrogation or from a failure by the police to honor defendant's expressed desire to cut off questioning. The court found defendant was nervous and excited at the time he made the remarks, but did not find evidence of mental impairment sufficient to make the remarks involuntary. Error on the psychiatrist's testimony was not preserved. The trial court properly found substantial evidence existed on the issue of defendant's sanity at the time of the offense and therefore submitted defendant's insanity defense to the jury.</SPAN></P>

The hearing revealed that defendant did not ask about the ultimate users and that the quantity of heroin he delivered would be sufficient to shoot up a number of times. The trial court found that defendant had not established accommodation as contemplated by &sect; 204.410. Defendant assigned as error, inter alia, that &sect; 204.410 unconstitutionally placed the burden of proof on him to prove accommodation and that &sect;204.410 unconstitutionally deprived him of jury trial on the accommodation issue. The court found that, at the time of defendant's hearing, &sect; 204.410 was constitutional in placing the burden of proof on defendant to prove accommodation. The court had subsequently held otherwise in State v.

The court found that the words &quot;resist&quot; and &quot;duties&quot; were clear in &sect; 742.1 as to defendants. The court noted that threats accompanied by a present ability and apparent intention to execute them would be sufficient to constitute resistance and that the officers were clearly in the discharge of their duties to make arrests at the time of the incident. The court determined that the jury instruction was proper because the offense could occur without the use of actual force so long as the conduct in opposition to the officers made it reasonably necessary for the officers to use force to carry out their duties.

He also argued that &sect; 204.410 was unconstitutional in that it purported to obviate the requirement that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged. Subsequent to defendant's trial, the court had decided in State v.

The court did not consider defendant's challenge to &sect; 204.410 on the ground that it was vague because defendant did not raise that issue in the trial court. The retroactive effect of State v.

On appeal of the conviction, the court concluded that defendant had standing to question the constitutionality of the sodomy statute as it applied to the private, consensual acts of adult persons of the opposite sex not married to each other as an invasion of personal rights. Further, the court found that if Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 705.1 and 705.2 were applied to sexual acts committed in private between consenting married couples, the statutes were unconstitutional. Therefore, that application had to extend to protect the manner of sexual relations performed in private between consenting adults of the opposite sex not married to each other.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been convicted of sodomy, but the conviction was reversed on appeal. Defendant's alleged perjury arose out of his testimony that he obtained the handcuffs allegedly used in the sodomy after a particular point in time on a certain day. On appeal, the court held that his testimony in that trial met the definition of perjury; that the conviction had been reversed was immaterial. The court held that the introduction into evidence of the sodomy indictment was not reversible error. To make the subject matter of a perjury prosecution intelligible to a jury, some general background evidence was admissible. Further, the jury heard only that defendant was indicted for sodomy; no details were given. Nor was it error to allow the sodomy victim to testify concerning the use of the handcuffs and the effect such use had upon her. Two of her challenged statements were clearly admissible and, although a third statement could have been excluded, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not doing so. Nor was it error to overrule defendant's motion for directed verdict. The victim's testimony and that of the provider of the handcuffs was sufficient to take the case to the jury.</SPAN></P>

A box of merchandise was missing, but the owner found the invoice listing the products delivered. Nearly one hour later, a policeman noticed a car parked in front of a closed service station. Its taillights were not burning, but its dome light was on. When he approached the station, the car quickly left. The policemen then noticed signs of criminal activity and followed the car. After the car was pulled over, the box described by the owner was found in the trunk, along with the exact type and number of items that were listed in the inventory. Defendant claimed he was playing cards at the time the burglary occurred and offered alibi witnesses. The court held that the inference of guilt was not unconstitutional. Bare possession of property recently stolen did not permit a rational juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the possessor committed the break in, as possession alone could not have supported an inference of guilt. However, a rational juror could have found defendant's guilt from his possession of goods that were recently stolen from the owner's station.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction for breaking and entering with intent to commit public offense.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile court employed the &quot;best interest of the minor or the public&quot; standard contained in Iowa Code &sect; 232.72 and determined that defendant should be transferred from juvenile court for trial as an adult. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to prison. On appeal, defendant claimed that the &quot;best interest&quot; standard of &sect; 232.72 was unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that the standard was sufficient notice to defendant to enable him to prepare for the waiver hearing and to protect him from arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory decision-making. The court held that &sect; 232.72 was not void for vagueness. The court rejected defendant's argument that a jury instruction on reasonable doubt was prolix and confusing and lessened the state's burden of proof. The court gave approved jury instructions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court with a modification of the decree and writ of injunction to strike the words &quot;disturbing&quot; and &quot;annoying.&quot; The food corporation's petition was grounded on allegations of trespass and obstruction of property and on claims of attempts to restrain or monopolize trade or limit the quantity of a commodity sold. The boycotters had attempted to assert special protection afforded their activities by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and by virtue of their claimed participation in a labor dispute. The court concluded that mere denials of specific paragraphs of the food corporation's petition were insufficient to raise the affirmative defenses to which reference had been made by the boycotters in their appeal. Thus the court held that the boycotters could not urge on appeal the defenses of First Amendment protection and their claim of involvement in a labor dispute, because such defenses were not properly raised below. The court concluded that the record revealed a violation of Iowa Code &sect; 553.1 sufficient to support the injunction substantially as it was ordered by the decree of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The State argued that defendant was obligated to prove he had a prescription, if in fact he had one, by virtue of &sect; 204.507(1), The Iowa Code. The court noted that defendant carefully preserved the issue at trial, relying on the relevant language of &sect; 204.401(3), The Iowa Code. The court found that, despite the inclusion of this provision near the prohibitory language, it had to be considered an exception and not an element of the offense. Where a defendant introduced no evidence indicating he was within the prescription exceptions, there was no burden on the State to negative the exception. The reach of &sect; 204.507(1), The Iowa Code, had to be limited to a requirement a defendant produce some evidence he was within a statutory exception before the State was obligated to assume the burden to negate the exception beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

He charged the court with &quot;willfully avoiding&quot; constitutional questions raised by him in three consecutive cases, thus violating the constitutional rights of his clients. The court examined provisions of the Iowa Code of Professional Responsibility for Lawyers and determined that it would admonish the attorney, based on his written assurances that he had not intended any disrespect or defiance to the court or any member of it. The citation was issued because the attorney ascribed improper motives to the court in not reaching all constitutional questions he sought to raise.

The new attorney's motions for a dismissal or alternatively a new trial was denied. On appeal, the court held that the affidavit, when viewed in its totality, sufficed to establish probability of criminal activity at the home. The court held that defendant was not prejudiced in the denial of a continuance because he delayed his request for six months and the retained counsel was not ineffective. The court determined that defendant was not subjected to double jeopardy due to conviction on a lesser offense that occurred out of the same factual circumstances. The court noted that two different controlled substances were involved and the elements of proof required as to the lesser offense were not the same as those essential to a conviction of the greater offense.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court erred in holding that the word &quot;lewdness&quot; was void for vagueness upon the challenge raised in defendant's demurrer, because the term was not vague as applied to defendant, and that defendant could not be heard to challenge &sect; 724.1 on the ground that it could conceivably be applied unconstitutionally against others.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association hired an attorney to obtain a ruling on whether the service tax on warehouse services applied to storage of interstate goods. An association member also asked a tax commissioner. The association's attorney wrote an opinion that the service tax did not apply to interstate storage. Later, the legislature specifically exempted that particular service. The department then assessed taxes against an association member, prompting the association to bring a declaratory judgment action. The trial court found in favor of the department. On appeal, the court affirmed that part of the ruling that held that the department was not estopped from assessing the tax. A tax commissioner's offhand &quot;unofficial&quot; comment over the phone to a member was not a basis for reliance, and there was no evidence that the other members relied on that information. And the association should have followed the prescribed rules for obtaining a ruling. The court reversed that part of the ruling that held movers liable for payment of the taxes, finding that the tax applied only if storage - not moving - was the predominant service.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment that the storage of household goods transported by a mover was automatically taxable.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the parents did not carry their burden to prove Iowa Code &sect; 613A.5 (1971) unconstitutional, and that compliance with its notice requirement was a condition precedent to the maintenance of an action for compensation for torts committed by governmental subdivisions. The court found that Iowa Code &sect; 614.8 (1971) did not act to toll the notice period because by its own language it did not apply to actions brought under Iowa Code ch. 613A (1971), but applied only to actions referred to in Iowa Code ch. 614 (1971).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiffs' personal injury action, the jury entered a nonunanimous verdict for defendants. On appeal, plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of Rule 203(a), which permitted verdicts by five-sixths of the jurors. The trial court held that the rule did not offend Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 9, which granted a trial by jury. On appeal, the court agreed and affirmed. The court held that &sect; 9 protected the general concept of a right to a jury trial, but the reference in the provision to a jury of less than 12 immediately allowed a change in the number of jurors required for a verdict. The court held that regardless of whether a jury was required to act unanimously or permitted to decide by votes of 10 to 2 or 11 to 1, the interest of the parties was protected. The court rejected and overruled its prior holdings that the jury under &sect; 9 was necessarily the jury recognized at common law as a jury of 12.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's demurrer to the information was overruled. The trial court convicted defendant, upon finding that he had failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that he had delivered cocaine to an undercover agent as an accommodation to another individual, and not with intent to profit. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded for a new trial. The court held that a reversal was warranted because the prosecutor improperly expressed his personal belief as to the guilt of defendant. The court also held that &sect; 204.410&nbsp;unconstitutionally shifted the burden to defendant to demonstrate that his delivery of a controlled substance was an accommodation. In so holding, the court followed a recent pronouncement on the requirements of due process set forth in a United States Supreme Court case. Thus, the court overruled the holdings of State v. Vietor, 208 N.W.2d 894 (Iowa 1973), and the succeeding cases which followed and re-articulated the holdings. The court excised the offensive portions of &sect; 204.410 and rendered it otherwise constitutionally adequate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a minor and her father, challenged a directed verdict from the Lee District Court (Iowa), which was in favor of defendants, a driver, his grandfather, and police officers, in actions arising from a rural road multiple vehicle collision in which a deputy responded in a sheriff's patrol car. The Iowa guest statute was invoked. The issue was defendants' recklessness or negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the patrol car was parked and the deputy was investigating an emergency call, the driver, with the minor as his guest in his grandfather's car, came over the crest of a hill and hit another car. The court did not find recklessness, but inexperience. Nothing in the factual situation regarding the driver's familiarity with his grandfather's car and the road, lack of shoulders, presence of hills, or any other factors could be said to have been so established in plaintiffs' favor as to alter the result. Reasonable minds could not legitimately infer that the driver had a heedless disregard of the consequences or indifference to the minor's rights and safety. The evidence was not of such substantiality as to raise a jury issue on recklessness. The trial court did not err in sustaining the directed verdict motions by the driver and his grandfather. The deputy had no special parking privilege. A violation of Code &sect; 321.354 would mean that the deputy was negligent per se, absent a legal excuse; therefore, the jury instruction was erroneous. The jury should have been appropriately instructed on the termination of an emergency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant executed a guilty plea after he was charged with robbery with aggravation. Because defendant previously had been convicted of larceny and breaking and entering, the State asked that he be sentenced as a habitual criminal.

Under &sect; 747.1, whenever any person had been twice convicted of either of the crimes of burglary, robbery, or larceny, he was to be imprisoned for a term of not more than 40 years. The court determined that pursuant to the statute, the district court properly considered defendant's prior convictions when imposing the sentence for the robbery conviction.

It held that one taxpayer was not impermissibly favored over another, and that the tax plan was rationally related to the public good of eliminating urban blight. It held that the bonds were debt for the purposes of the Iowa Const. art. XI, &sect; 3. Section 3 limited a city's debt to five percent of the value of the taxable property within it.

On appeal, the main issue was whether it was constitutional to hold a railroad liable for failing to maintain cattle guards against cattle running at large when cattle were no longer allowed to run at large. The court noted that the railroad's arguments went to the wisdom of the legislation challenged and not its constitutionality. The court held that there were no equal protection or due process clause violations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The long distance carrier had always provided all long distance facilities for the city served by the local exchange carrier. The local exchange carrier, however, informed the long distance carrier that the local carrier was planning to install and operate certain long distance equipment that the long distance carrier had proposed to do. The long distance carrier requested a determination by the Commission that it was entitled to install the equipment. The Commission determined that the local carrier's installation of the equipment would entail of duplication of facilities and that the long distance carrier should provide the equipment. The district court concluded that the Commission's order requiring the local carrier to allow the long distance carrier to install equipment at its facility deprived the local carrier of property rights. In reversing the order, the court ruled that connection of local exchanges with the lines of a long distance company was within the jurisdiction of the Commission under &sect; 490A.11. The power to prescribe the terms under which the telephone lines were to be connected was a necessary incident of the power to require connections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adoption agency sought a declaratory judgment that an adoption was valid. The parents had never married and only the mother had consented to a release of parental rights. The father's consent was not obtained, nor was he afforded notice and opportunity to have been heard. The father attacked the child placement and adoption statutes, Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 238.26-238.28, 600.3, as violative of his equal protection and due process rights. The trial court found the statutes unconstitutional. The court reversed the ruling and held that the statutes were constitutional. The laws did not violate the father's equal protection because the only classification distinction for consent was between caring and noncaring parents, and such classification bore a rational relationship to the state's interest of promoting the welfare and best interests of children within the state. The statutes also met procedural due process because Iowa Code &sect; 600.3 provided for hearings in adoption proceedings. The court then detailed the notice provisions for known and unknown fathers, and stated that a known father had the burden of proving that he had been and was providing for the care of the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a demurrer, asserting that &sect; 714.22, which pertained to exposing dead bodies, was too vague, incomplete, and indefinite. The trial court sustained the demurrer, reasoning that because the body remained buried for &quot;18 or 19 months&quot; defendant could not be found guilty of exposing the body. Further, it concluded burial precluded conviction for throwing away or abandoning the body. Finally, it held certain terms in the statute were unconstitutionally vague. The State asserted that the trial court was in error in considering evidence in ruling on defendant's demurrer and erroneously determined that &sect; 714.22 was unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the trial court did not consider evidence in ruling on the constitutional issue, but rather considered the circumstances alleged in the minutes attached to the information, and judicially noticed matters learned from a companion case. However, the court agreed with the State that this could not furnish grounds for sustaining the demurrer, as matters alleged in the minutes were not part of the indictment or information. The court also found the statute as a whole was not unconstitutional and the charge was valid.</SPAN></P>

The truck's tires matched the tire tracks left at the victim's business. The officer also noticed that the driver of the truck, defendant, was wearing a torn jacket that matched the color of a piece of cloth found at the victim's business. When the officer questioned defendant, defendant admitted that the truck and the jacket were his. As such, defendant was arrested and his jacket was taken from him. When he was released, defendant was given his truck back without two tires and without the scrap metal. Evidence was introduced at trial that the cloth found at the crime scene had been part of defendant's jacket. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling defendant's motion to suppress the testimony of two witnesses even though the notice of their testimony under Iowa Code &sect; 780.10 was served on defendant's attorney rather than defendant.

Moreover, the court determined that the city had generally complied with Iowa Code &sect; 390 (1975) in reaching the joint agreement. However, the court concluded that the joint agreement violated Iowa Code &sect; 390.4(6)-(7) (1975) by purporting to grant rights of indemnity among the co-owners to an extent greater than they would have under the law.

The juvenile court denied the petition, finding the State had failed to carry its burden of proving these allegations. The father instituted this habeas corpus action against the agency for custody of the child. The trial court ruled that the release to the agency was valid and its custody of the child was legal. It further held that the father did not sustained his burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that he was a fit and capable custodian and that it would be in the best interest of the child to be placed with him. The court affirmed. The father did not raise a challenge to the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 238.27 and 238.28, The Iowa Code until the appeal. Thus, it was not an issue for appeal.

In support of reversal, defendant asserted that the trial court erred in denying his suppression motion. The court reversed defendant's conviction. Defendant initially contended that since the vehicle was not stopped for the purpose of examining the operator's permit, but rather to satisfy the officers' mere suspicions or curiosity, the viewing officer was not in a place where he had a lawful right to be. The court found that the stop was not effected for the purpose of inspecting the operator's permit. Therefore the officer was not in a place where he had a lawful right to be. The seized weapon was inadmissible into evidence. Also, the gun seizure was not justified by reason of a lawful investigatory stop. The facts did not support a finding that the stop was for a reasonably adequate investigatory purpose.</SPAN></P>

The trial court specified that the ground for delinquency was breaking and entering.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the juvenile challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 232.31, The Code, because it allowed determination of delinquency on &quot;clear and convincing&quot; evidence. The court held that the evidence of the breaking and entering charge convinced it beyond a reasonable doubt. Each element of the crime was established. In his second proposition, the juvenile complained that the trial court admitted into evidence a &quot;family record&quot; compiled by the juvenile probation office and testimony of the sheriff with reference to jail damage. The court held that the juvenile was not prejudiced by the trial court's ruling relating to that evidence. The court did not consider it in its de novo review and was not required to pass on the merits of the juvenile's objections. The court did not reach the issue regarding whether &sect; 232.2(13)(d), the Code, defining &quot;delinquent child,&quot; was unconstitutional. The juvenile was not declared delinquent under the provisions of &sect; 232.2(13)(d) and therefore lacked standing to attack the constitutionality of that statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor vetoed qualifications that the legislature had imposed upon appropriations bills. Plaintiff challenged the vetoes as being violative of 1968 item veto amendment to the Iowa Constitution. When the trial court upheld the vetoes, plaintiffs appealed. Upon review, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the attempted vetoes by the governor were beyond the scope of the item-veto amendment, and were, thus, of no effect. The court held that the qualifications in the bills were within the legislative domain and did not invade the powers of the governor; thus, if the governor wished to veto the legislatively imposed qualifications upon the appropriation, he had to veto the accompanying appropriation as well. The court held that because each of the clauses in the acts were qualifications upon the particular appropriation, and because they were not separate, severable provisions, the governor could not let the appropriation stand, yet nullify the condition upon which the legislators gave their consent to the expenditure.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 747.5, The Code (Iowa) set up a reasonable classification that was not subject to challenge under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that the insurer's cause of action was not barred by Iowa Code &sect; 496A.120 because it was not a suit on any right, claim, or demand that arose out of the transaction of business by a foreign corporation where it merely arose out of litigation in a foreign state.</SPAN></P>

It was stipulated that the delivery was to be an accommodation sale.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first argued that the record did not support the trial court's determination that there was a factual basis for her guilty plea.

The court reviewed in detail the steps the trial judge took to make that determination in defendant's case. The court held that the factual basis for the plea was adequately identified and disclosed in the record. As to her equal protection claim, defendant argued that a man convicted of the same crime would be allowed to remain at the county jail, whereas she, a 27-year-old mother, would be transferred to the women's reformatory several hundred miles away. The court noted that the record showed that, when the trial judge addressed defendant personally at the plea and sentencing stage as to the maximum penalty that could be imposed, he called her attention to the fact that any sentence confining her to a county jail for a term of more than 30 days would have to be served in the women's reformatory. Neither then nor at any other stage of the proceedings had she raised the equal protection issue. Thus, she had not preserved the issue for appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's quiet title action resulted in adjudication adverse to defendants as holders of claimed reversionary interests. Defendants argued that Iowa Code &sect; 614.24 was inapplicable to their interest and unconstitutional as far as any extinguishment of their interests in certain real estate because it deprived them of their property rights without notice and without due process of law. The court rejected defendants' claim that since defendants' reverter interests did not vest until after enactment of &sect; 614.24, the statute unconstitutionally denied defendants their vested future interest before their right of enforcement matured. The court held that &sect; 614.24 did not serve to unconstitutionally deprive defendants of any vested rights, and that they were not denied procedural due process. Defendants had adequate notice and opportunity for hearing before their vested property rights were extinguished; the publication of legislative enactments was deemed adequate notification.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the presence of the attorney general at a county grand jury proceeding was not improper because Iowa Code &sect; 13.2 (1971) authorized the attorney general to appear and examine witnesses and produce evidence during grand jury proceedings in the several counties of the state. The court rejected defendants' claim that Iowa Code ch. 553 violated their constitutional due process rights because it found that Iowa Code &sect; 553.9, which permitted prosecuting attorneys to keep a portion of the fines assessed against defendants, was severable from that chapter. The court also held that defendants were not entitled to a directed verdict because the temporary absence of members of the grand jury at various times during the taking of testimony and introduction of evidence did not invalidate the indictment.</SPAN></P>

A justifiable controversy existed between the residents and the city, because the residents were affected by city's actions, but not between the residents and the county because the creation of the freeway was speculative and uncertain. The home rule act was not in violation of the home-rule amendment because the laws were not frozen by the passage of the amendment.

Defendant argued that the giving of the instruction was error because the instruction did not define the terms &quot;lawful authority&quot; and &quot;lawful command.&quot; The court found that those words, which themselves had a common and generally accepted meaning, were sufficiently further defined and limited in the fourth paragraph of instruction as applied to the factual circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first argued that the trial court erred by its failure to give a requested instruction on entrapment. The court found that defendant failed to produce sufficient evidence to establish a jury question on a theory of entrapment by the use of an informer; thus, the instruction was not warranted. The facts showed that a voluntary informant that contacted law enforcement authorities was first invited to buy drugs by a third party before he called the authorities and this did not warrant the entrapment instruction. Defendant also argued that the mandatory prison sentence required by &sect; 204.401, subsection two (2) of the Code (Iowa) unconstitutionally denied him an effective hearing at sentencing and created an unreasonable and arbitrary distinction between criminal offenses. He argued that the mandatory imprisonment provision of the statute denied effective assistance of counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings in that the statute prohibited consideration of factors regarding possible probation. He argued he was thus denied equal protection of the law but failed to provide any authority in support of his allegations. Thus, that assignment of error was waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Eminent domain proceedings were commenced against the owner. The owner appealed to the trial court and the agency filed a motion to dismiss her appeal or to affirm the commission award because of the owner's failure to file a petition within the time prescribed by Iowa Code &sect; 472.22. The owner appealed and the agency filed a motion to modify the trial court's order because the owner failed to vacate her property. The trial court sustained the agency's motion to affirm the condemnation award and issued a writ of possession. The owner filed a petition in certiorari, which the trial court denied. The owner appealed and the court affirmed, holding that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The court held that the trial court's earlier ruling was interlocutory, was provisional, was not finally decisive of the case, and did not deprive the owner of a right which could not be protected by an appeal from the trial court's final adjudication.The court found that since the condemnation proceeding was commenced to install low-income housing on the property, it was valid as a public use and both constitutional and statutorily authorized under Iowa Code ch. 403A.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court found defendant's arguments without merit. The admission of defendant as set out was certainly inconsistent with his plea of not guilty to the crime charged and served to contradict his assertion that he was not a drug dealer and the marijuana did not belong to him.The admission constituted competent evidence that the trial court properly permitted the jury to consider.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of defendant's convictions arose from the delivery of amphetamines, which occurred before the effective date of 1973 Code, &sect; 204.401(1), and the other from the delivery of marijuana. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction for the delivery of amphetamines, and affirmed the conviction for the delivery of marijuana. The amphetamines conviction was reversed because it was in violation of the ex post facto clause. Section 204.401(1) was effective July 1, 1971, and as it increased the penalty for the offense compared with the former statute, &sect; 204A.3(1), The Code, 1971, its application to defendant's alleged delivery of amphetamines was in violation of the ex post facto clause, Article I, &sect; 9 United States Constitution. As to the marijuana charge, at defendant's request, the State was charged with the burden of proving that defendant had intent to profit, which issue was resolved in defendant's favor; defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's procedures. A proper foundation was established for the introduction into evidence of marijuana allegedly purchased by an undercover agent from defendant. The evidence sustained the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendants were convicted, after trial in a police court, of drag racing in violation of &sect; 321.284, The Code, 1971 (Iowa), they appealed to the Johnson District Court (Iowa). After a bench trial de novo, the district court convicted defendants of drag racing. Defendants appealed, claiming that the State failed to prove they were &quot;competing for speed,&quot; as required under &sect; 321.284. They also argued they were improperly denied a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed their demand for a jury trial two days after such demand was permitted under District Rule 4.7 (Iowa). The district court denied defendants' request for a jury trial due to their failure to file such request within the time required under Rule 4.7. At trial, two officers testified that they saw two vehicles driven by defendants on a road at a speed in excess of the posted speed limit. The officers stated that as the cars approached an intersection, one vehicle pulled in front of the other. Defendants denied they were drag racing and claimed the driver of the passing car was merely changing lanes. On appeal, the court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendants' request for a jury trial. Because drag racing was a non-indictable or petty offense, defendants could properly waive their right to a jury trial by failing to comply with Rule 4.7. The State presented sufficient evidence to show that defendants were &quot;competing for speed&quot; so as to sustain their convictions. The element of competition was established by the evidence that defendants rapidly accelerated their vehicles and that one cut in front of the other at high speed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the Iowa Air Pollution Control Commission (APCC), appealed a decision of the Madison District Court (Iowa), which, in an action to enjoin defendant city from burning refuse, ruled that the action, which was pending when the legislature revised existing environmental statues, was abated by the simultaneous repeal and reenactment of the applicable statutes, which contained virtually the same provisions prohibiting the burning of refuse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The APCC sued the city under Iowa Code ch. 136B to enjoin it from burning refuse. The action was pending when the legislature revised existing environmental statutes, with the new enactment, Iowa Code ch. 445B, containing substantially the same provisions prohibiting the burning of refuse, except for the allowed maximum penalty. A trial court held that the action was abated by the simultaneous repeal and enactment of the applicable statutes. On appeal by the APCC, the court reversed and remanded. The court explained that while Iowa had a general savings statute that was applicable to all repealing statutes, it was unnecessary for the APCC to rely on the statute because a special rule preserved its right to proceed. Where one statute was repealed by another that reenacted virtually the same provisions, the simultaneous repeal and reenactment was not a true repeal, but an affirmation and continuation of the original statute. Thus, the pending action was not abated. Moreover, the court believed that the rule making authority of the APCC could withstand the challenge that it was an unconstitutional delegation of power under the state constitution's separation of powers clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trial court convicted defendant for possession of heroin, a violation of Iowa Code &sect; 204.401(3). On appeal, the court affirmed, rejecting defendant's contention that her addiction was a defense to the charge of possession because she could not, without help, exercise any control over seeking and possessing the drug. Defendant testified that while she knew that possession of the drug was illegal, she felt that she needed it in order to exist. The trial court properly sustained the objection to proffered expert testimony that her possession of the drug was not voluntary or willful because an addict could request and obtain treatment and rehabilitation without the request or fact of treatment being used against such person in court. Those addicts who voluntarily appeared at treatment centers reflected the irrelevancy of testimony on behalf of defendant that she could not control her conduct by herself. Finally, the court rejected the assertion that the statute was unconstitutional because it created a crime out of a status, drug addiction. Punishment was imposed on defendant following her conviction, not because of her addiction status, but because of her heroin possession.</SPAN></P>

The landowners asserted that damages were properly valued as of the date of the trial. The court held that the trial court determination was improper because the jury was improperly instructed. The damages should have been assessed and compensation determined as of the time of the taking. Damages were to be assessed as of the date of the formal order of taking because the alienation of the owner's property was definitive, complete, and perpetual on that day. The court further determined that errors related to witness testimony was properly preserved in spite of the fact that the council failed to object to such testimony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minutes of testimony showed the State claimed defendant solicited sexual intercourse with a police vice squad officer for $ 20. Her motion to dismiss the information on the ground that &sect; 724.2 was unconstitutionally vague under U.S. Const. Amends. 5, 14 was overruled. On appeal, the court concluded that there were at least three reasons her attack on &sect; 724.2 had to fail. Her vagueness challenge in the trial court did not raise the constitutional issue she argued on appeal, which was a claim of overbreadth. The court held that, even if her challenge raised the vagueness issue, prior judicial determinations had given &sect; 724.2 a fairly ascertainable meaning. Finally, she lacked standing to attack the constitutionality of the statute on its face. The statute was definite in its prohibition of the conduct charged. As to jury nullification, the court pointed out that the matter had been governed by statute in Iowa since 1851. In keeping with the statutes over the years, including &sect; 3016, The Code, 1851 and &sect;&sect; 780.23, 780.24, The Code, a district court jury was obliged not only to receive but to follow the district court's instructions on the law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two of the current defendants were previously charged with obscenity. The court had reversed defendants' convictions without prejudice on the ground that the county attorney's information charging defendants with a violation of &sect; 725.5, Iowa Code failed to allege the necessary element of scienter. Subsequently, amended informations were filed against defendants. These informations, along with original informations were consolidated into one case. Defendants filed a demurrer which was not ruled upon. In the interim, the United States Supreme Court decided Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), which set forth new guidelines which obscenity statutes had to follow to avoid being unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Defendants then filed a supplemental demurrer, alleging &sect; 725.5, Iowa Code to be unconstitutionally vague under the Miller guidelines. The district court judge sustained defendants' supplemental demurrer. Affirming, the court declined to incorporate the Miller standards into &sect; 725.5, as it was not a judicial function to rewrite statutes by construction.</SPAN></P>

The parent filed a motion to strike the negligence count on the ground that it failed to state a cause of action under the Iowa guest statute,&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 321.494, which the trial court affirmed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that plaintiffs failed to establish that &sect; 321.494 was clearly and palpably unconstitutional. The court held that the classification between automobile guests and paying passengers in &sect; 321.494 was rationally based and did not violate the equal protection clause of either U.S. Const. amend.

At no time did defendant challenge accuracy of statements in the report about his background nor was the district court asked to disregard any of them or to afford defendant a chance to refute or discredit any of them.

Moreover, there were no other sources from which the court could clarify the meanings of the terms.

The court held that denying defendant a verbatim record denied him equal protection in relation to trial preparation because the value of the testimony given depended upon its spontaneity, the memory of the witnesses at that time, and any variances in testimony between that date and the next time the witnesses testified. the court noted that Iowa Code &sect; 761.15 (1971) was unconstitutional as applied to defendant but was later repealed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled the demurrers and defendants were convicted. On appeal the court reversed the convictions, finding that &sect; 725.3 was vague because it failed to define obscenity and to give fair notice to the average person of the conduct prohibited. The statute was also overbroad because it directly conflicted with the basic obscenity guideline that required a finding that the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appealed to prurient interest and, instead, required a finding that the film would tend to corrupt the morals of youths or others.

The State sought to enjoin appellees, a pharmacy and its manager, from filling prescriptions written by nonresident physicians not licensed by the State of Iowa.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ordered and adjudged that the Iowa Controlled Substances Act was intended to regulate intrastate transactions, and the registration required by the United States Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act of 1970 constituted sufficient compliance by a nonresident practitioner to come within the purview, intent, and purposes of the Iowa Controlled Substances Act. The central question on appeal was whether the Iowa Uniform Controlled Substances Act should have been construed to prohibit the filling by Iowa pharmacists of prescriptions written by nonresident physicians who were not registered by the Iowa authorities to prescribe controlled substances. The court noted that the construction placed upon the Iowa statute by the State would have caused a positive conflict in policy so that the state and federal statutes could not consistently stand together as was intended. Affirming, the court limited the application of Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 204.308, 204.101(22) (1973) to practitioners registered in Iowa.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rejected the student's argument that &sect; 613A.5 was unconstitutional and dismissed his claims against the school district and the city. On appeal, the court dismissed the student's appeal of the portion of the order that dismissed his claims against the school district because the liability of the school district and the teacher was closely related. Because the claims against the teacher had not been dismissed, the dismissal of the claims against the school district was a non-appealable interlocutory order. However, the portion of the order dismissing the student's claims against the city was a final, appealable order. The court held that the claims against the city were properly dismissed because &sect; 613A.5 was constitutional. The additional requirements &sect; 613A.5 placed on victims of governmental torts were not arbitrary and were rationally related to legitimate governmental interests.</SPAN></P>

After a payment for several weeks, the insurance company then stopped payments, claiming plaintiff had recovered from her injuries. The court found that plaintiff's claim of unilateral compensation of payments without notice and hearing as an unconstitutional denial of due process was not properly before the court. The issue was foreclosed by plaintiff's failure to appeal from the first review-reopening decision, which specifically found no further compensation due. The court found that one doctor's deposition was not furnished to the commissioner when he decided the case. The court held that the commissioner's refusal to permit plaintiff to produce additional testimony was an abuse of discretion.

The court rejected appellant's contention that &sect; 32.1 was unconstitutionally vague. The court found that &sect; 32.1 could be violated without specific intent.

The court held that &sect; 32.1 could not be constitutionally applied to prohibit appellant's symbolic speech.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While represented by court-appointed counsel, defendant pleaded guilty to a charge of larceny in the nighttime and was given a deferred sentence and probation. When defendant's probation officer reported that defendant had violated several probation conditions, the district court held a hearing at which it denied defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea and refused to allow defense counsel to withdraw. The district court then sentenced defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the district court had not abused its discretion under Code 1973, &sect; 777.15 (Iowa) in refusing to permit defendant to withdraw his guilty plea. The district court had not erred in overruling defendant's motion to dismiss for delay in trial. The five-month delay between the information and the plea did not rise to the level of unconstitutional deprivation of speedy trial, and defendant was responsible for any delay resulting from the order for deferred sentence. The district court had not denied defendant effective representation by counsel. The district court's adverse rulings at the sentencing hearing were not a ground for changing counsel in the midst of the hearing.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff filed an action to enforce the contract. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant on the ground that plaintiff was not a corporation competent to enter into any binding agreements cognizable under the laws. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment. Although an action in quo warranto was the exclusive remedy for a party who sought merely to test the legality of a corporation, defendant did not institute an equitable proceeding to test the legality of plaintiff's existence. Plaintiff's lack of capacity to enter into the contract was raised only as a defense to a private interest. Thus, the rules and statutes relating to quo warranto actions did not bar defendant from raising such a defense. Since plaintiff's corporate existence had terminated at the time the contract was alleged to have been entered into, defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Iowa Code &sect; 496A.130 provided a right to notice and opportunity to be heard. Thus, the section was not constitutionally defective.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the domiciliary state retained jurisdiction to tax tangible personal property that had not acquired an actual situs elsewhere. The vessel owner failed to carry its burden that the towboat had a taxable situs in any other jurisdiction. The vessel owner failed to show that the towboat was habitually present in some particular state other than Iowa, or that it maintained a fixed and regular route through a particular nondomiciliary state that could constitutionally impose an apportioned ad valorem tax. Therefore, Iowa, the domiciliary state, was entitled to tax the vessel owner's towboat. The court concluded that, as to the vessel owner, &sect; 427.13(8) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

She was found guilty of flag desecration. On appeal, she argued that the trial court erred in holding that Iowa Code &sect; 32.1 was constitutionally applied to her symbolic act of political protest and in not determining the statute was overbroad. The court held that the regulation of defendant's act of burning the flag was sufficiently justified because it furthered the important or substantial governmental interest in preserving the peace. Preventing breaches of the peace outweighed defendant's right to freedom of symbolic expression. The emotions of the people of the United States were so integrally linked to the flag that its desecration in public was an invitation to violence, not because of the ideas allegedly symbolized by such act, but because of the nature of the act itself. The court concluded that desecration of a flag by burning created far more than an undifferentiated fear of a breach of the peace disturbance. Iowa Code &sect; 32.1 was constitutionally applied to defendant's conduct, and her overbreadth challenge failed for lack of standing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident accumulated 35 old cars on his premises, most of them inoperable. The board, deeming the situation a health nuisance, ordered the resident to remove the cars. The resident filed a petition for a decree that declared certain sections of the health ordinance unconstitutional and that enjoined the board from abating the alleged health nuisance and from prosecuting him for alleged violations of the ordinance. The trial court denied the petition. On appeal, the court reversed and directed that the injunction issue. In the resident's case, the ordinance operated unconstitutionally in violating due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The ordinance did not provide for notice and a hearing. However offending aesthetically, the vehicles were nowhere defined as a health nuisance per se. The same vehicles in a licensed salvage yard would be legitimate merchandise. Where, as here, no emergency existed and the determination of a nuisance lay only in the discretion of an administrative officer, the scales tipped against unrestricted governmental action under the guise of police power and in favor of the due process notice and hearing requirements.</SPAN></P>

The inmate's attempt to use post-conviction relief as a substitute for the simple statutory remedy of lodging objections to trial court's instructions, motion for new trial, and direct appeal, violated section 663A.2, The Code (Iowa).

The trial court granted the writ, and found the statute unconstitutional, but found the ordinance constitutional. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the city was permitted to prevent people from blocking or obstructing traffic or sidewalks. It was clear that the ordinance did not prohibit people from standing on the sidewalks, but only prohibited them from blocking the sidewalks so that others could not pass; therefore, the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague.

The next day, the officer took defendant before a magistrate and defendant posted bail. The magistrate did not hold a preliminary examination, and defendant did not waive one. Two months later, the prosecutor filed a county attorney's information charging defendant with driving while intoxicated, and defendant was convicted. Defendant contended that the offense of operating a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated condition under Iowa Code &sect; 321.281 (1966) was changed to operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage. Defendant also contended that the information was not filed timely as required by Iowa Code &sect; 795.1. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that &quot;operating a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated condition&quot; meant the same thing as &quot;operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage&quot; and constituted the same offense. The court also held that &sect; 795.1 did not apply because defendant was not held to answer by the magistrate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff administrator and beneficiaries of a decedent's estate (administrator) appealed from a judgment of the Linn District Court (Iowa), which upon a jury verdict found for defendant hotel and company (hotel) in the administrator's action to recover damages under the Iowa Dramshop Act, &sect; 123.95, The Code, 1966.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator's decedent was a passenger in a car struck by an oncoming car driven by an intoxicated driver, who had consumed both alcohol and drugs. After the decedent died, the administrator sought to recover from the hotel on the theory that it sold or gave beer or intoxicating whiskey to the driver to a point where the driver was intoxicated and remained intoxicated until the collision with the car in which decedent was a passenger. The district court found in favor of the hotel. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court ruled that the district court properly instructed the jury that the administrator was required to prove that the alcohol served by the hotel was a proximate cause of the driver's intoxication at the time of the collision, to the extent that it was a substantial cooperating, concurring, or contributing cause to the intoxication. The jury was properly instructed that if alcohol served by the hotel was not the proximate cause of the driver's intoxication, there was no liability on the part of the hotel. The instruction did not require the jury to find a portion of the alcohol sold by the hotel to the driver was in his blood at the time of the accident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In condemnation proceedings, plaintiff property owners appealed an order of the Scott District Court (Iowa) that granted defendant state highway commission's motion for a new trial or remittitur, granting a new trial unless the property owners agreed to remit the a portion of the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners purchased land for $ 21,000. Eight years later, the state highway commission instituted condemnation proceedings. At trial, a real estate appraiser testifying for the state highway commission testified that the value of the property had increased in value by $ 2,500. The jury returned a verdict awarding $ 23,500 to the property owners. The state highway commission moved for a new trial or for a remittitur. The district court granted the motion, granting a new trial unless the property owners agreed to remit the amount of the award exceeding $ 21,000. The property owners appealed. In reversing and remanding with instructions to reinstate the verdict of the jury, the court held that a remittitur was not appropriate in condemnation cases. The district court was required to either enter a judgment in the amount fixed by the jury or, in a proper case, order a new trial. It was the constitutional right of the property owners not only to receive just compensation for the property taken from them but also to have the amount of that compensation awarded to them by a jury. The testimony of the real estate appraiser alone was sufficient to support the award.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the district court was reversed, and the case was remanded with instructions to reinstate the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for breaking and entering. On review, he contended that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to dismiss predicated on asserted denial of a speedy trial, in violation of his rights under Iowa Code &sect; 795.2 and the Sixth Amendment. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court for dismissal. The court rejected the rule that absent a demand an accused, per se, waived his right to a &sect; 795.2 speedy trial. The court's holding was restricted to the case at bar, cases pending on appeal where a challenge to the demand-waiver rule was an issue, and cases filed after the filing of the opinion. However, the court also ruled that &sect; 795.2 was still viable. As it was evident that the State had relied solely on the impermissible demand-waiver rule, it was apparent that defendant was denied his statutory right to a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>
