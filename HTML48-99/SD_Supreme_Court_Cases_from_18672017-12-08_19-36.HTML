</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee landowner brought an action against appellant county challenging its assessment of appellee's property, which was based on a method that classified certain real property as irrigable and valued it as such. The court found that irrigated or irrigable land cannot be separately classified for tax purposes under the South Dakota Constitution, and ordered appellant to assess such lands like other agricultural lands. Appellant appealed. The court found that the state department of revenue assigned a yearly rating to each soil type, and appellant's arbitrary addition of an irrigation indicator resulted in an increased valuation via a separate classification, which constituted unconstitutional double taxation. The court also found that the substantial increase had no relation to fair market value and resulted in an unjust assessment of the property because appellant did not apply valuation procedures consistently or uniformly, and lacked comparable sales information.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order affirmed because appellant county unconstitutionally double taxed appellee by arbitrarily adding an irrigation indicator to the state department of revenue's assigned tax rating for agricultural lands, and the resulting tax increase had no relation to the property's fair market value.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendants' motion for summary judgment and declared that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 42-11-1(6)(e) violated the &quot;open courts&quot; provision of S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was injured while working at a rodeo when a gate struck him in the face. Plaintiff filed a negligence suit against defendants, rodeo owner and sponsor, among others. Plaintiff also sought a declaratory judgment that S.D. Codified Laws ch. 42-11 was unconstitutional. The trial court denied motions for summary judgment filed by all the parties. The trial court also declared that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 42-11-1(6)(e) violated S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 20, the &quot;open courts&quot; provision. The court reversed. The trial court erroneously determined that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 42-11-1(6)(e) provided defendants with complete immunity. In fact, the statute provided defendants with only a limited form of partial immunity for negligence actions. Plaintiff would not be without a remedy if he could establish that his injuries were caused by faulty equipment or that they were caused by acts committed by defendants with a willful or wanton disregard for plaintiff's safety. The willful or wanton standard did not violate S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 20. If plaintiff met this heightened burden of proof or satisfied the other statutory exceptions to partial immunity, his claim could succeed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that declared that a certain state statute violated the open courts provision of the state constitution. The statute only provided partial immunity to defendants, rodeo owner and sponsor, against whom plaintiff brought a negligence suit. Plaintiff still had a remedy if he met the heightened burden of proof by establishing that defendants' acts were willful or wanton .</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Butte County appealed from a summary judgment entered by the Eighth Judicial Circuit, Butte County (South Dakota), which held that res judicata or collateral estoppel prevented utilization of a method of assessment that separately classified agricultural land as irrigable and non-irrigable. Butte County argued that the doctrine of res judicata was not applicable to the assessment of appellees' agricultural property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Res judicata was not applicable as to the valuation of appellees' agricultural property. Butte County valued appellees' agricultural property based on the irrigable and non-irrigable nature of the land. An assessment made by Butte County in a previous year was found to be unconstitutional. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees based on res judicata because the court had previously decided that the method of valuation was unconstitutional as it classified agricultural land as irrigable and non-irrigable. The court held that irrigability can be considered a factor in assessing land value. The court determined that the doctrine of res judicata did not apply as Butte County had established a material question of fact as to whether its current assessment procedure had cured the faults from the previous unconstitutional assessment. The court reversed and remanded the case for trial on the merits as to the legality of the assessment methods.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment granted in favor of appellees and remanded for a trial on the merits because a material question of fact existed as to the legality of Butte County's assessment method for determining the value of agricultural land that contained irrigable and non-irrigable sections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of South Dakota reversed a trial court order requiring appellant commission to approve a special use permit, which allowed appellee to operate a hog feedlot. The court reasoned that an anticipated nuisance could not be forbidden unless it was shown that the proposed construction or use was a nuisance per se, or that while it may not amount to a nuisance per se, under the circumstances of the case, a nuisance must necessarily result from the contemplated act. Under the within circumstances, the court held that appellee had not carried its burden of overcoming the presumption that appellant had acted within its discretion when it concluded that appellee's operation of the feedlot at an anticipated location would be a nuisance in fact. Arbitrary and capricious action was characterized by, inter alia, a lack of relevant and competent evidence to support the action taken.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment reversing and remanding appellant commission's denial of appellee's special use permit was reversed, where appellee failed to overcome the presumption that appellant had acted within its discretion.

The statutory criteria for imposing psychotropic medication upon a court's order were met, because respondent's judgment was so affected by mental illness that he lacked the capacity to make a competent decision regarding his medication. Respondent's abusive behavior made him a danger to others, his condition was deteriorating, and medication could improve his condition. The testimony of one physician was sufficient to establish respondent's incompetence and the need for medication, and there were no statutory testimonial requirements. The order was not overly broad, because the court was not in a position to determine respondent's precise medication needs, which might change with time, and were best left to healthcare professionals.</SPAN></P>

Codified Laws &sect; 10-28-16. Appellants, school district and county, contested the 1995 assessment, including the distribution of the statewide value to the counties and other governmental subdivisions on a strict pro rata per mile of track basis. The circuit court granted appellees partial summary judgment, finding that the statutory scheme mandated such distribution. On appeal, the court affirmed. It rejected appellant's contentions that the circuit court erred in interpreting &sect; 10-28-16, or alternatively that it was unconstitutional. There were no factual issues in dispute. The court agreed with the circuit court's interpretation of the statute. Moreover, appellants, as creations of the legislature, lacked standing to attack the constitutionality of the statute. Further, none of the exceptions to the general rule regarding standing applied, because taxpayers were the real parties in interest capable of meeting the traditional standing requirements.</SPAN></P>

Codified Laws &sect; 15-2-14.4. Appellant sought review. Court held that appellant had not raised the issue of continuous representation and abandoned fraudulent concealment on oral argument, and absent this, the statute of limitations was presumed correct. Further, court held that appellant's request for additional consideration, given that this involved an IRS settlement, was a matter for a legislative rather than a judicial decision. Finally, court held that appellant's argument that the statute was unconstitutional because it closed the courthouse door before damages accrued, in violation of the open courts provision of S.D.

Defendant also discussed a homemade gun and various materials lying around to be used to make explosives. The trial court convicted defendant after he pleaded non contendere to possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute and unauthorized possession of substances with intent to make a destructive device. Defendant also pleaded guilty to other controlled substances offenses and to possession of a firearm by one with a prior violent crime conviction. Defendant appealed his convictions claiming that the trial judge should have removed himself sua sponte from the case when he was required to rule on the legal validity of a search warrant he issued. The court did not reach the merits of this issue because it found that defendant waived this claim by failing to move to recuse the trial judge and by pleading guilty and nolo contendere to the charges. The court also found defendant's contentions that his pleas were based on an insufficient understanding of the nature of the charges were without merit because the trial court adequately advised defendant of his rights prior to accepting his plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was reindicted a week after charges against him were dismissed. Defendant was convicted under the new indictment of improper sexual contact, rape, and unauthorized distribution. Defendant claimed his rights to a speedy trial were violated. The court found no evidence to show the original indictment was improperly dismissed or that the state dismissed the charges in the original indictment to circumvent the 180-day rule. Thus, the 180-day period began when defendant first appeared on the reindictment and any delay thereafter was due to his counsel. Defendant was not entitled to a continuance as he failed to show that the unavailable witness testimony would be of any help. However, the court ruled that any conviction concerning one of the victims had to be reversed as the trial court had improperly quashed defendant's subpoena of this victim's counseling records. The trial court should have conducted an in camera review for exculpatory material before it quashed the subpoena based on victim's privilege.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father and appellee mother had a brief encounter from which a child was born. Appellee mother never told appellant father that he had fathered a child, despite the fact that they lived in the same town for the first three years of their daughter's life. When the daughter was 14 years old, appellee filed an action for child support against appellant, seeking ongoing, as well as back child support. After the paternity test confirmed that appellant was the father, he did not contest payment of the ongoing child support; however, he challenged his obligation to pay back child support since he had not been aware that he had a child. The trial court granted appellee $ 14,000 in back child support under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-8-5, but, on appeal, the court reversed, finding that appellee's claim for back child support was barred by the doctrines of laches and equitable estoppel. The court found that appellee had intentionally withheld the information of appellant's paternity from him and that such conduct prejudiced appellant. The court found that, under the circumstances, requiring appellant to pay $ 14,000 in retroactive child support would be wholly inequitable.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss on the basis that sovereign immunity barred the action. On appeal, plaintiff argued that her allegations of breach of statutory and common-law duties were not barred by sovereign immunity because they pertained to ministerial acts or omissions by defendants. The court disagreed, affirming the trial court's order. Ministerial act or task meant an act or task that involved obedience to instructions, but demanded no special discretion, judgment, or skill. Here, plaintiff claimed that defendant DOT secretary had a statutory duty to inspect, maintain, and repair the interstate bridges to protect the traveling public from injury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of the First Judicial Circuit, Lincoln County, South Dakota, which granted summary judgment to defendant county in plaintiff's action that alleged that defendant violated its due process rights and took its property without just compensation in allowing a referendum vote which denied plaintiff a change in the zoning of its property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Union County Planning and Zoning Board recommended plaintiff corporation's requested rezoning change. Before the adoption of the zoning amendment was to go into effect, the county auditor received a petition referring the amendment to the zoning ordinances to a public vote. The referendum took place, and the ordinance that would have allowed the rezoning change was voted down. Plaintiff filed suit, alleging that defendant county violated its due process rights in allowing the referendum vote. The trial court granted defendant summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. Allowing a referendum vote on a rezoning ordinance did not violate plaintiff's due process rights. Defendant's contention that a rezoning amendment was merely an administrative matter and thus not subject to a referendum under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 7-18A-15.1 was erroneous. A rezoning amendment was a legislative act because it was the creation of a new rule of conduct. Use of the referendum process did not violate the federal and South Dakota constitutions. The referendum was a legitimate means for direct political participation, allowing the people the final decision over enactments of representative bodies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to defendant county in plaintiff corporation's action that alleged that defendant violated its due process rights and took its property in allowing for a referendum vote. A rezoning amendment was a legislative act because it was the creation of a new rule of conduct and was therefore subject to the referendum process. The process was a means of direct political participation and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction for second-degree murder. The trial court's jury instructions on second-degree murder were not in error. Defendant's claim that the depraved indifference definition in second-degree murder should have sounded worse than the cruel and unusual manner for first-degree manslaughter was without merit. While killing in a barbaric manner, part of the definition for cruel and unusual, sounded worse than depraved indifference, the distinction was that for first-degree manslaughter, the killing must be in the heat of passion and the perpetrator had to be unable to control his actions. The trial court did not err in allowing certain photographs into evidence because they were admitted to help aid witnesses in their testimony and were relevant. The trial court did not err in not allowing defendant to impeach the testimony of two of the state's witnesses because instances of specific conduct of the victim could not be proved by extrinsic evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from the Circuit Court of the Fifth Judicial Circuit, Marshall County, South Dakota, which granted summary judgment for defendant, a bar, in plaintiff's action for injuries he sustained in an accident with a drunken motorist, who was supplied with alcohol by defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimed S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 35-11-1, which provided that the consumption of alcohol, rather than the serving of alcohol, was the proximate cause of any injury inflicted upon another by an intoxicated person, and therefore cut off defendant's liability, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the summary judgment for defendant in plaintiff's action to recover for personal injuries. Section 35-11-1 was not a violation of the separation of powers doctrine, as it returned to the common law rule of nonliability for furnishers of alcohol which had existed in South Dakota for most of its history. Plaintiff was unable to cite to any case in any jurisdiction that had found that establishing the proximate cause of alcohol related loss was a violation of separation of powers. S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 35-4-78 and 35-11-1 did not violate the open courts provision of S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 20. That provision was meant to allow unhindered access to the courthouse by a person who had a valid cause of action based on existing statute or the common law. It did not create a cause of action or allow people to bypass valid statutory bans on certain kinds of actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment for defendant in plaintiff's action for injuries sustained with a drunken motorist supplied with alcohol by defendant. Statutory law that established the consumption of alcohol was the proximate cause of alcohol-related loss and denied liability for tavern owners that served alcohol to intoxicated persons did not violate separation of powers or the open courts provision of the South Dakota Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought a writ of prohibition ordering respondents to cease implementing portions of a general appropriations bill adopted by the legislature concerning salary increases for certain of respondents' employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioners' request for a writ of prohibition ordering respondents to refrain from allocating any funds other than in accordance with the existing salary schedule, but granted the request ordering respondents to refrain from issuing contracts allocating funds without adherence to the provisions of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 3-18. There was nothing unconstitutional in that part of the bill that allowed respondents to distribute salary increases in a manner to be determined at the sole discretion of respondents because it did not change existing law. Section 31 of the bill, which stated any other provisions of &sect; 3-18 notwithstanding, was unconstitutional under S.D. Const. art. XII, &sect; 2, because it was an attempt to change existing law by allowing respondents to increase salaries without complying with collective bargaining as required by &sect; 3-18. For much the same reason, that section also violated S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 21. The bill could be saved by severing section 31 because the legislature would have appropriated funds for salary increases without section 31.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioners' request for a writ of prohibition in part and granted it in part. Respondents could not be precluded from allocating funds provided in the bill at their discretion because that part of the appropriations bill was constitutional. Respondents could not allocate funds provided for in the bill without regard to collective bargaining because the provision in the bill that allowed for that was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the allegedly negligent placement of a metal hemoclip over the patient's ureter during surgery did not constitute a continuing tort that tolled the statute of limitations. The court found that, because the hemoclip was not ever supposed to be removed, the only negligent act that could have occurred was when it was put into place. The court held that the doctor was under no duty to inform the patient that the hemoclip was placed in her body because it was not a &quot;foreign object&quot; for the purpose of tolling the statute of limitations where it was intended to remain in her permanently. The court further held that trial court correctly applied the law regarding the continuing tort exception for medical malpractice cases.

Upon review, the court affirmed. The court held defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction that he had an unqualified right to shoot a person who had entered his home with the intent to commit any type of felony where pursuant to case law, lethal force was only justified to prevent a forcible atrocious felony. The court determined there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the homicide committed by defendant was not justified where the jury could have properly concluded that it was one thing to shoot a felonious intruder who enters by night to injure, but that it was another thing entirely to shoot as a felon an unarmed friend during an argument in one's home. The court found that defendant was brought to trial within 180 days of his first appearance pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-44-5.1(4), where the time the trial court spent in disposing of defendant's pretrial motions and the delay accompanying an incompetency evaluation were properly excluded from 180 days allowed.</SPAN></P>

A jury found him guilty of violating the protection order, in violation of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-10-13, and the circuit court affirmed. Defendant appealed, claming that he could not be convicted of violating S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-10-13 because courts, in granting protection orders, were limited under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-10-6 to prohibiting acts of domestic abuse and entry into the dwelling of the protected person.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants purchased the land in question for $ 125,000. Prior to the purchase it was assessed for tax purposes at $ 20,700. The next assessment raised the valuation of the land for tax purposes to $ 107,600. The Board, in raising the assessment, relied upon S.D.

The trial court affirmed the Board's assessment. The claimants argued that the South Dakota Constitution authorized the legislature to create only one class of agricultural property for taxation purposes, and that &sect; 10-6-58 created two classes of agricultural property: one class that sold for less than 150 percent of its agricultural income value, and another class which sold for more than 150 percent of its agricultural income value. The court agreed and that &sect; 10-6-58 was unconstitutional as a violation of S.D. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 15. The court held that S.D.

While the appeal was pending, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals enjoined the state from relitigating key issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision that barred the state from arguing that the corporation had no legitimate entitlement to a permit for the solid waste landfill. Therefore the state could no longer argue that the corporation had no property right that could be threatened by an unconstitutional taking. Further, the state was barred from disputing whether the referendum was the proximate cause of the corporation's dissolution. The court reversed the summary judgment in favor of the state and found that the court was bound by the dictates of the federal decision, both by reason of the exception to the Anti-Injunction Act, as well as by principles of comity, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court reasoned that the Eighth Circuit held that the issues of proximate cause and entitlement to a permit were conclusively determined in that case, the state was the same party against whom the prior adjudication was rendered, and the state had a full and fair opportunity to defend its claim at that point.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate challenged a decision of a circuit court (South Dakota), which denied him a writ of habeas corpus. He contended that the refusal of the South Dakota Board of Pardons and Paroles to give him credit for the time that he served in the Colorado penitentiary between the issuance of a warrant for his arrest on a parole violation and the final revocation was a violation of the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1985, the inmate was sentenced to imprisonment in South Dakota. In 1990, he was released on parole, with supervision in Colorado, and incarcerated in Colorado in 1993. In June 1993, South Dakota issued a warrant for the inmate's arrest for a parole violation and the final revocation order was entered in October 1994. The inmate's request that he be given credit for the time served in Colorado between June 1993 and October 1994 was denied. The circuit court denied his petition for habeas corpus based on that denial and the court affirmed. The 1986 amendment to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 24-15-21, which suspended the parole supervision time after a warrant of arrest was issued, did not relate to the inmate's original crime, was not retrospective and, therefore, did not violate the ex post facto clauses. Further, the amendment to the S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 24-15-24 addressing the tolling of parole supervision time was in effect when the inmate violated his probation and his parole. Thus, the inmate had fair warning of the consequences of violating the conditions of his probation and parole. Finally, granting credit for time served in another jurisdiction was within the board's discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon the arrestee's arrest for DUI, the police officer allegedly handcuffed the arrestee too tightly, thereby causing injury to his wrists. On appeal, the arrestee claimed that the police officer falsely arrested him as there was no probable cause and that the officer's gross negligence produced a genuine &sect; 1983 action for excessive force. In affirming the award of summary judgment, the court held that, as the arrestee pled guilty to a charge stemming from the very arrest he claimed was defective, he waived lack of probable cause as a basis for a false arrest claim under &sect; 1983. Second, while the circuit court incorrectly applied qualified immunity, the summary judgment was proper. Specifically, the circuit court did not need to reach the issue of qualified immunity as the arrestee failed to demonstrate that the officer acted in conscious disregard of his constitutional rights in violation of &sect; 1983. Applying the standard for assessing Fourth Amendment excessive force claims, whether the officer's actions were &quot;objectively reasonable,&quot; the court found that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that the officer was entitled to summary judgment as matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the city and the police officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer bought two parcels of property for $ 53,750.

In 1995, the property was assessed a value of $ 119,424 under a replacement cost approach. The director disregarded the sale price because she determined that the unique situations of the parcels distorted the true value. The circuit court affirmed the director's valuation. The taxpayer appealed. The court held that the circuit court was not clearly erroneous in finding that the taxpayer did not meet his burden of presenting sufficient evidence to show that the director failed to act in accordance with the law, or to overcome the presumption that the director's assessment was valid.The director, who applied the cost and income approaches and considered the market approach, followed the statutorily required basis for determining valuation. The director's decision to disregard the sale price was supported by the evidence. The validity of the assessment was supported by the close proximity between the valuations under the income approach and the replacement cost approach.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff son was severely injured when his truck collided with a motorcycle traveling at high speed.

On appeal, the court affirmed because neither the chamber, nor the bars involved, was liable for negligence. The chamber was not liable because it was a legal entity separate from the local chapter with no knowledge, input, or responsibility for the event. The accident was not foreseeable to the chamber and the chamber had no duty to guard against it. The bars were not liable because two statutes clearly precluded recovery against a bar for the serving of alcohol. S.D.

Const. art.

On review, the court concluded that the statutes of limitations did not violate the open courts provision and that the statutes were not unconstitutional as applied to the individuals. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that the legislature had a right to place conditions on the use of courts. The court held that statutes of limitations, in general, did not create or extinguish rights but merely placed limitations on remedies. The court also held that the open courts provision was not considered a restriction on legislative authority and did not guarantee that remedies once existent would always remain so.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. III, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate elections the losing candidates sought a recount and were later determined to be the winners. The original winners (recount challengers) filed separate motions for writs of certiorari to review the recount proceedings. The candidates filed motions to quash the writs of certiorari, claiming that S.D. art. III, &sect; 9 made the legislature the exclusive judge of disputed legislative elections and that the principle of separation of powers foreclosed any involvement by the judiciary. The court denied the candidates' motion to quash. The court held that S.D. Const. art. V, &sect; 5 and S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 12-21-47, 12-21-48(1), 12-21-2 specifically empowered the court to review irregularities and errors in the tabulation of voters in any recount proceeding. The court noted that it had no power under the constitution to make any final determination of the election as to who would be seated because that power remained with the legislature under S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 9. The court found that the method used for counting the disputed straight party ballots was in error and directed the recount boards to hold a recount using the method set forth in the opinion.</SPAN></P>

Upon receipt of the certifications, the court would enter judgment.</SPAN></P>

The company contended on appeal that the trial court erred in denying its post-trial motion for vacatur or remittitur of the punitive damages award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first jury awarded $ 500,000 in punitive damages. The court remanded for a new trial on the issue of punitive damages because the trial court should have admitted evidence of the company's financial worth. On appeal, the court held that the $ 750,000 award by the second jury was not excessive given the circumstances, including the fact that the investor was unsophisticated. The company owed him a duty to inform him of the known risks, yet it sold the security as a &quot;conservative&quot; investment. In addition, the award was not out of line with the company's ability to pay. When it applied the five factors for review of a punitive damages award, the court held that the award did not shock the collective conscience because the company's conduct was fraudulent and intentional. The trial court properly instructed the jury that it could award punitive damages based on the preponderance of evidence standard. It declined to adopt the clear and convincing burden of proof suggested by the company. The trial court did not err in allowing testimony by the investor's expert witness as to the inherent risks as outlined in a prospectus because the testimony established what the company knew.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the declaratory judgment and the landowners appealed, asserting that the transportation easement imposed by S.D.

Codified Laws &sect; 41-9-1.1 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. It noted that the legislature of South Dakota and the court had recognized the right to use public highways for recreational purposes. The use by the public of the section line rights-of-way for recreation, which included hunting, dated back to the 1880s and had not been successfully challenged in South Dakota. Thus, the court concluded that hunting, fishing, and trapping were included in the public right-of-way easements in South Dakota.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged decisions of the Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit, Pennington County, South Dakota, and the Circuit Court of the Eighth Judicial Circuit, Meade County, South Dakota, affirming the decisions of the administrative law judges and the boards of equalization upholding the valuations placed by respondents, Pennington County and Meade County, on the taxpayer's ranch, which lay across both counties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Part of the taxpayers' ranch was located in Pennington County and part was located in Meade County. The taxpayer challenged the valuations of Pennington County and Meade County and claimed, in part, that the Pennington County property should be valued as rangeland instead of cropland because of its inaccessibility. The circuit courts affirmed the decisions of the lower tribunals. The court affirmed the decision of the Meade County circuit court and reversed the decision of the Pennington County circuit court. It found that the Pennington county property could not be used as cropland due to its inaccessibility because it was bordered by a river to the north and rimrock ledges on the east, west, and south sides and could not be accessed by farming equipment. Further, the assessment was unjust because the county assessor did not go far enough as he stopped his search after finding he did not have enough sales to make a comparison and did not look to other counties for similar property. The court remanded the matter, as the taxpayer should not have been penalized because there were insufficient comparable sales in the area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the Meade County circuit court, which upheld the valuation placed on that portion of the taxpayer's ranch that was situated in that county. It reversed the decision of the Pennington County circuit court affirming the valuation placed on the property located in Pennington County and remanded the matter to that county for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of the First Judicial Circuit, Lincoln County, South Dakota entered judgment convicting defendant of first-degree rape and first-degree murder and sentencing him to death. Defendant appealed the convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised numerous contentions on appeal, one of that challenged the lower court's admission of evidence of previous crimes in order to show proof of identity pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect;19-12-5. The court reasoned the lower court was required to follow a two-step analysis when ruling on the admissibility of other acts evidence. The court found that the State was unable to define concrete similarities among the other acts and the charged offenses and that it failed to give the jury any clear guidance concerning the relevance of the other acts to legitimate issues in the case. The court reasoned that without more compelling direction from the State, the jury's verdict almost certainly rested on the forbidden inference that because defendant was involved in other sexual assaults, he likely committed the offenses against the present victim. The court concluded the lower court abused its discretion in admitting the other acts testimony because the danger of unfair prejudice so substantially outweighed the probative value of defendant's prior bad acts that he was denied a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment-convicting defendant of first-degree rape and first-degree murder was reversed and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's ex-wife obtained a protection order against defendant that included a prohibition from verbal contact, defendant sent his ex-wife a letter. Defendant's ex-wife turned the letter over to the state's attorney, who charged defendant with violating the protection order. The trial court entered a judgment of conviction pursuant to &sect; 25-10-13. Defendant challenged the conviction, contending that &sect; 25-10-13 was overbroad and unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court held that by using the mail to contact his ex-wife, defendant went beyond freedom of expression in a public forum and intruded upon the ex-wife's personal sanctuary. The court held that, if defendant was truly confused or aggrieved by the scope of the order, he could have sought to modify or dissolve it before choosing to violate it. Given what defendant knew, considering his admissions and the fact that the judge told him not to write letters, the injunction against &quot;verbal contact&quot; as applied to defendant was not impermissibly vague.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that because the life sentence was the maximum sentence for first-degree manslaughter, the sentence did not shock the conscience of conscience of men generally as reflected in the legislative acts defining the permissible punishment for manslaughter. Because the trial court found that defendant had a number of prior misdemeanor convictions involving violence inflicted upon those persons whom defendant supposedly held near and dear and involved women, and because there was no expert testimony or evidence on whether defendant was capable of rehabilitation, the trial court properly found that the issue of rehabilitation could not be addressed until defendant learned to control his desire to control people, which was so remote or improbable that a life sentence was warranted.

Codified Laws &sect; 21-5-1 for the death of their unborn child by miscarriage at 7.3 weeks of pregnancy alleged caused by the company's wrongful act. The United States District Court for the District of South Dakota certified the question whether &sect; 21-5-1 provided for such a cause of action involving a nonviable unborn child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother, who was 7.3 weeks pregnant, contracted salmonella poisoning after eating a portion of the company's product. All parties agreed that the child, who died in utero, was not viable outside the uterus. Upon review, the court held that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 21-5-1 encompassed nonviable children in the term &quot;unborn child,&quot; which preserved the interests of parents in their unborn child and authorized a remedy when a third party wrongfully ended the child's life before birth. Thus, the parents could seek redress regardless of whether the unborn child was viable. The statute's language was clear, certain, and unambiguous, and &quot;unborn&quot; as defined in its ordinary and popular sense meant not born or brought into being, and still within the mother's womb. The court found that the legislature clearly intended in its use of the term unborn to include any child still within a mother's womb and it made no distinction between viable and nonviable. Moreover, the concept of viability was outmoded in tort law and was a purely arbitrary milestone from which to reckon a child's legal existence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified question as yes, allowing the parents to bring the wrongful death action against the company.</SPAN></P>

The United States admitted liability and invoked the $ 1 million cap on medical malpractice damages under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 21-3-11. The federal district court found the cap was constitutional. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit certified four questions to the court.</SPAN></P>

Specialists failed to report to nurses or physicians that the son's temperature had been dropping throughout the night and the son developed hypoglycemia, suffered respiratory arrest, and developed severe brain damage. The court framed one issue as whether the damage limitation under &sect; 21-3-11 was unconstitutional. The court found that &sect; 21-3-11 violated the S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6 guarantee of the right to a trial by jury because the amount of damages was a factual issue to be determined by the trier of fact. The statute also violated S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 20, the open courts and remedy-for-injury provision by making doctors liable for only a portion of their negligence. Due process was also violated by the arbitrary classification of malpractice claimants based on the amount of damages. Next, the court held that a parent's claim of emotional distress or loss of consortium for injuries to a minor child was not recognized based on the court's analysis of common law.</SPAN></P>

The driver suffered damages when her car slid off a county highway where the surface suddenly switched from pavement to gravel. The trial court held that the driver failed to provide timely notice of her injury as required by S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 3-21-3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver contended that the trial court erred in granting the county summary judgment because the county should have been estopped from raising lack of notice to the attorney general as an affirmative defense. The court agreed and found that the county breached its duty to exercise good faith in acting on her claim by asserting that it was actively investigating the claim when, in reality, it was merely waiting for the notice period to expire before denying the claim. County adjusters &quot;strung the driver along&quot; with excuses that they were investigating her claim while the time for providing notice ticked by. Had the county's adjusters promptly notified the driver that the county intended to deny her claim because of lack of notice, the driver would have provided the notice as she ultimately did, albeit untimely. There was not &quot;mere innocent silence or inaction&quot; on the part of the county's adjusters. Rather, they made affirmative representations to the driver that investigation of the claim was ongoing. In fact, that was not the case. This intended deception and the affirmative declarations of the county's adjusters should have estopped the county from raising the notice defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that the &sect; 35-4-78(1)&nbsp;unconstitutionally violated its substantive due process rights under S.D. Const. art. VI and U.S. Const. amend. 14 by imposing vicarious liability on the corporation for the illegal acts of its employees. The court noted that a corporation could only act through its agents. The court rejected the corporation's argument that to avert constitutional entanglement, a corporate superior had to know that an employee was selling liquor to an underage person and either consented to or ratified the act. The court held that legislative acts that were essentially public welfare regulatory measures could omit the knowledge element without violating substantive due process guarantees. Where the penalties were relatively small and conviction did no grave damage to an offender's reputation, the court held that dispensing with a mens rea was constitutional. The court noted that the challenged statute had a real and substantive relation to the objectives it sought to attain. Finally, the court determined that the imposition of a $ 200 fine was consistent with the nature of the regulatory offense and did not offend the corporation's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree robbery for stealing a woman's purse. Defendant argued that his trial counsel failed to effectively move for severance from defendant's co-defendant. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment. In doing so, the court held that the defense strategy (that there was not any identification of defendant as the other &quot;dark-skinned&quot; male at the crime scene) was not mutually exclusive from the co-defendant's defense of mistaken identification. Thus, the trial court properly denied defense counsel's motion for severance. Because the issue of lack of probable cause for defendant's arrest was raised in the trial court, it could not have been reviewed on the merits during habeas review. The court agreed with the habeas court's finding that trial counsel was competent on every issue and that defendant failed to show any due process errors. The court also found that the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself was proper because the trial judge's was not aware that the victim was engaged to a former client until he received an invitation during the trial.

Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 36-20A-15 and 36-20A-20, were unconstitutional was not ripe for review.</SPAN></P>

After the disciplinary proceedings were terminated, the accountant brought the instant action, challenging the constitutionality of S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 36-20A-15 and 36-20A-20. The court affirmed the judgment in part, reversed it in part, and remanded it in part, concluding that the accountant's constitutional challenge to &sect; 36-20A-20 was not ripe because there was no indication that the accountant would be disciplined under that section and, as such, that no real, present, or imminent controversy was presented. The court concluded, however, that the accountant's constitutional challenge to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 36-20A-15 was ripe for review because he was subject to the Board's quality reviews every three years. The court explained that a matter was sufficiently ripe if the facts indicated imminent conflict. The court chose not to decide the constitutional issue, explaining that there was no evidence of an existing emergency.</SPAN></P>

III, &sect; 26 because it created a special commission whose powers, defined by the Act, involved an improper delegation of municipal functions. The city contended the trial court did not use the correct standard in determining constitutionality, but the court held that the trial court imposed the correct standard of proof to assess constitutionality when it held that there was a strong presumption as to the constitutionality of the statute. The court held that the EMSA was engaged in a municipal function prohibited by S.D. Const. III, &sect; 26. The EMSA was also a special commission. The EMSA was not subject to local control and oversight. For instance, its commissioners could not be replaced. The EMSA's power to tax was not constitutional because it was not limited by proper standards. All provisions of the Act were wholly interdependent and the Act was wholly invalid.</SPAN></P>

She claimed that S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 10-27-3 through 10-27-7 were unconstitutional in violation of S. D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 20, known as the &quot;open courts&quot; provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-27-3 required the property owner to tender the amount owed in her pleadings. If the opposing party accepted that amount, the property owner had 10 days to deposit this amount with the country treasurer. The property owner failed to do this. She claimed that this requirement barred her access to the courts and that such a requirement was unconstitutional under S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 20. The court disagreed. The requirement under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-59-9 to pay the tax deficiency or post bond before appealing an assessment to the circuit court did not violate the open courts provision. The South Dakota Constitution guaranteed that the state's courts would be open to its citizens, and that all taxation would be equal and uniform. However, that did not mean that any procedural conditions that the legislature placed on tax litigation would necessarily be unconstitutional. The court viewed S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 10-27-3 through 10-27-7, requiring the property owner to tender the amount of back taxes due and deposit this sum with the county treasurer, as a procedural condition that did not conflict with the open courts provision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The builder contracted with the city to construct water mains and sewer lines.

The builder demanded arbitration, according to the contract. The city claimed there was no agreement to arbitrate, but when the arbitrator declared it would proceed, the city requested the trial court stay the arbitration. The trial court granted the request, finding that S.D.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">S.D. Admin.

The rule also permitted management of the accounting, collection and disbursement of progressive payouts. The operator complained and the trial court found that the rule violated sections of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 42-7B because it unlawfully permitted slot machine manufacturers and distributors to perform functions statutorily reserved to operators and retailers. On appeal, the court reversed because the gaming commission had not violated &sect; 42-7B and S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, when it promulgated S.D. Admin. R. 20:18:17:24.14. The court noted that the gaming companies were not &quot;placing&quot; and &quot;operating&quot; slot machines in gambling establishments and had not become operators by virtue of the audit and security functions they performed, which were in addition to the obligations imposed on operators or retailers of all non-progressive machines.

Defendant contended that his sentence was excessive and violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII and S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 23. The court found that defendant's sentence was not so constitutionally offensive as to shock the conscience, particularly in light of his betrayal of the trust of the victims and their parents and his repeated abuse of eight very young boys, two of whom he continued to deny abusing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was previously convicted of a felony mail offense, but his conviction was set aside under the Federal Youth Corrections Act. Defendant failed to pay sales tax on seven occasions. A plea agreement was worked out where defendant was to make payment and the State was to stay silent during sentencing. A presentence report revealed the federal conviction. The trial court found that defendant's prior felony conviction prohibited suspension of imposition of defendant's sentence. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. The trial court correctly determined that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-27-13 prevented suspension of imposition. Although there was a split in the federal court over whether the Federal Youth Corrections Act authorized expunction of the record, the court concluded the better rule was that it had not. There was no violation of the Supremacy Clause because there was no conflict between the federal and state laws. Even if a due process argument existed because of the different treatments given in federal court for &quot;set aside&quot; sentences under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, the court lacked authority to restrict the federal courts' interpretation of federal law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizens sought an alternative writ of prohibition restraining defendants, the state lottery commission and its members (the state), from operating a video lottery and a writ of mandamus requiring the immediate revocation of video lottery licenses. The Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit (South Dakota) granted summary judgment to the state. The citizens appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that video lottery was a &quot;lottery&quot; within the meaning of S.D. art. III, &sect; 25, that video lottery was owned and operated by the state, and that the state received the entire net proceeds from video lottery operations. The citizens contended that video lottery was not authorized under art. III, &sect; 25. The court agreed and reversed the trial court's order. The court remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions to enter summary judgment in favor of the citizens. The court held that video lottery was not a &quot;lottery&quot; as contemplated under the state constitution, but rather, was a &quot;game of chance,&quot; which was prohibited by art. III, &sect; 25. The court reasoned that video lottery encompassed less pervasive games that involved one or a few players as opposed to a large number, that the player had some conscious control over his input as opposed to merely a token or a ticket, and that there were choices available to the participant while playing the game, which affected the outcome. The court concluded that the legislature's power under art. III, &sect; 25, was limited to authorizing &quot;a state lottery,&quot; not state &quot;games of chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, trustee and as individual, sought review of a decision by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Judicial Circuit, Brown County (South Dakota), which rendered a judgment in favor of appellee medical center for the costs of care for the trustee's elderly mother pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-7-27.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustee contended that the trial court abused its discretion when it allowed the medical center to amend its complaint to include the &sect; 25-7-27 claim. The court stated that the trial court properly allowed the medical center to amend the complaint to include the &sect; 25-7-27 claim. The court found that at trial, the medical center proved that the trustee received mutual funds from the maintenance trust at his mother's death. Thus, under the facts of the case, the trial court was correct in holding the trustee liable under &sect; 25-7-27. The court applied a two-tier test and held that &sect; 25-7-27 did not make an arbitrary classification. Moreover, &sect; 25-7-27 served a legitimate legislative interest, especially under the facts of the case, where indigency was voluntarily created by the trust and there would have been sufficient assets to pay for the parent's care had the trust not been created. Hence, the trustee had not been denied his right to equal protection under the law. The court determined that given its plain and ordinary meaning, &sect; 25-7-27 was not unconstitutionally vague and was properly applied in the case. Thus, the court affirmed the judgment entered for the medical center.</SPAN></P>

The State charged defendant with being a habitual offender. Defendant's sentence was enhanced based upon four prior convictions. On appeal, defendant argued that the previous guilty pleas were not made voluntarily, intelligently, or knowingly and that the record was silent concerning the factual basis for the guilty pleas. The court affirmed. The court held that because defendant was collaterally challenging his previous pleas, the State first had to come forward with evidence of the valid judgments. A presumption of regularity attached. The burden of proof then shifted to defendant to show that there was a constitutional defect in the previous proceedings. The court held that a silent record or generalized claim of error was insufficient to establish constitutional defect. Defendant failed to meet his burden of proof. The record showed that for the previous convictions, defendant was advised of his rights, was represented by counsel, repeatedly indicated that he &quot;understood,&quot; and was well experienced in the criminal justice system.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contracted with the victim to incinerate the victim's medical waste. Instead, defendants buried the waste in different location than agreed. The victim did not suffer financial loss in the transaction. Defendants claimed that burying the waste was not theft by deception but was merely a breach of the contract. Defendants also argued that at the time of the contract they intended to incinerate the waste but changed their minds later to bury it. The court held that because the State presented a witness who testified that defendants spoke with him about burying the waste on his property prior to the time the contract was executed, the intent to deceive under the statute was proven. There need not be financial loss in order for there to be &quot;pecuniary significance&quot; under the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was given life without parole. Petitioner also challenged on appeal the refusal of a parole board to set parole eligibility. He also alleged that jury instructions were required on second degree manslaughter as a lesser-included offense. On appeal, the court affirmed. An instruction on first degree manslaughter only and on heat of passion were correct because the evidence was sufficient that petitioner was enraged and killed the victim because she threatened to tell petitioner's ex-girlfriend that she and petitioner had sex. Counsel was not ineffective for the failure to raise the sufficiency of the evidence on the heat of passion issue on direct appeal because federal decisions on the issue acted as res judicata. Whether S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 24-15-4, which stated that a person sentenced to life imprisonment was not eligible for parole, was an ex post facto law would not be reviewed because petitioner did not timely challenge the failure to provide a parole date. Petitioner waited some 20 years after the conviction to seek parole, and he did not timely file a notice of appeal when the parole board denied his application.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that (1) the laboratory and the patient had a continuing treatment relationship that permitted the admission of slides taken more than two years before the suit was brought, (2) the final slide was admissible as relevant to the laboratory's observance of the standard of care, (3) character evidence in the form of personnel records was admissible, (4) the jury award of $ 3.7 million was not outrageous, (5) the laboratory was not permitted to deposit funds with the court under S.D.

When the employee was injured, he filed an action in negligence. The employer argued that as a matter of law the employee was limited to the exclusive remedies of the South Dakota Worker's Compensation Act but the trial court denied the employer's motion for summary judgment. On review, the court held that the Act was the exclusive remedy unless the employer engaged in an intentional tort pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 62-3-2. The court rejected the Ohio standard that equated &quot;intentional tort&quot; with gross negligence or extreme recklessness. Instead, the court imposed the stricter standard in which the employee had to prove that the employer acted with the actual intent to injure the employee or acted with a substantial certainty that injury to his employees would be the inevitable outcome of his conduct. The court held that summary judgment was suitable to resolve an issue of law, rather than fact, even in a negligence action.

Defendant alleged error in failing to give a jury instruction on his subjective understanding of the victim's ability to give consent, in the failure to suppress bodily samples, and in the admission of defendant's statements in violation of the Miranda rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was 16 but had the mental capacity of an eight or a nine-year-old person. Defendant alleged that he was unaware of the victim's mental capacity and that the victim consented to sex at a gathering of friends. Defendant was arrested and read his Miranda rights, but he was denied counsel after asking for an attorney repeatedly. Another officer questioned defendant, and he expressed his desire to waive his rights. A taped statement followed. Another requested instruction dealt with mistake of fact. The court affirmed on appeal. Defendant's requested instructions were properly denied because the perpetrator's knowledge of the victim's mental stage was not an issue under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-22-1(2) (1990). Any error in the admission of evidence of bodily samples taken from defendant was moot because the samples were never offered into evidence by the State. The refusal to provide counsel and the continued questioning once counsel was requested violated the Miranda rule. However, the error was harmless because the statements by defendant, even if suppressed, would not have led to acquittal. There was significant independent evidence of the rape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother designated the child at issue as &quot;illegitimate&quot; on the Minnesota birth record. Over eight years later, a county child support office in Minnesota sent a letter to the father naming him as the putative father of the child and seeking child support. The father promptly denied paternity and asserted that the action was barred by the six-year statute of limitations under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-8-9. Neither Minnesota nor the mother ever responded to the father's denial. Seven years later, Minnesota served an order for hearing on the father, claiming that a 1989 amendment to &sect;25-8-9 revived the previously barred paternity action. The father moved to dismiss, again asserting the statute of limitations. After the trial court denied the motion, he requested and was granted an intermediate appeal. The court reversed, finding that the legislature could not revive a cause of action that had previously been barred by the statute of limitations. Statutes that affected substantive rights could not be given retroactive effect. Once the father was released by the operation of the statute of limitations, he was protected against its revival by a change in the limitation law.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court erred in allowing the two constitutionally invalid convictions to sustain defendant's fourth offense DUI conviction. The court stated that in order to use the prior convictions, the burden remained with the State to show that defendant either had the assistance of counsel in entering his pleas or that he knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to counsel in those proceedings.

The court held that H.B. 1009, which created a tax credit program for producers of ethanol, violated S.D. Const. art.

The jury found defendant guilty of DUI. The trial court then determined that it was defendant's third DUI conviction and it sentenced him accordingly. On appeal, the court held that under the &quot;implied consent&quot; law of S.D.

Accordingly, the court remanded the matter for further proceedings, concluding that the record was insufficient to permit a determination as to whether the arresting officer knew, prior to the blood test, that defendant had two prior DUI's.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Certain Senators and Representatives filed a petition seeking a writ of prohibition to prevent the Treasurer and Secretary of Revenue from disbursing or allocating funds pursuant to certain appropriations contained in the 1992 General Appropriations Bill. The senators and representatives alleged that such expenses were special appropriations requiring a two-thirds vote. The court issued a permanent writ of prohibition against the treasurer and secretary and concluded that the appropriation bill purporting to give counties annual property tax relief and limited economic development created a continuing appropriation which required a two-thirds vote of each house of the legislature. The tax credit fund could not be logically construed to be an ordinary expense of the State government, and the property tax credit was not necessary in order to properly operate the State government. Also, the appropriation to build a National Guard armory was a capital expenditure and could not be considered a current expense.

Const. art. VI, &sect; 23, and that it was disproportionate to his offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was intoxicated and had a loaded rifle when he was found by police at a time when he was awaiting trial on two felony charges, and assaulted a police officer attempting to arrest him. After his first sentence was reversed on appeal, he was given the maximum sentence of 15 years, S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 22-18-1.1(3), 22-6-1 (1988). On review, the court found that great deference was due to sentencing decisions of trial courts, that the appropriate test was whether a sentence shocked the conscience or was so grossly disproportionate to a crime that it activated the Eighth Amendment's &quot;within and without jurisdiction&quot; proportionality tests, and that a sentence within statutory limits was not ordinarily appealable. The court was not moved by comparisons of his sentence with those of other inmates convicted of aggravated assault. The court found that in South Dakota the test to be applied was (1) whether a punishment was so excessive or cruel as to meet general disapproval and (2) whether it shocked the conscience of the Supreme Court of South Dakota. The court affirmed and found that the sentence was within statutory limits and did not require proportionality analysis.</SPAN></P>

Codified Laws ch. 10-46A (Michie) was unconstitutional, the court held that a challenge of a violated statute was not salient to a revocation appeal because the proceedings related to whether or not the terms of probation had been violated. There was sufficient evidence that defendant violated S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-46A-13.1 (Michie) by engaging in business without obtaining a contractor's tax license, and the trial court was reasonably satisfied that defendant's conduct was not as good as required by the terms of probation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his wife were charged with neglecting to provide proper nourishment and medical treatment for their three-month-old infant. In accepting defendant's guilty but mentally ill plea, the trial court relied on two psychiatrists' reports to find that defendant understood right from wrong at the time of the alleged child abuse. On review, the court held that the trial court's finding that defendant understood right from wrong at the time of the alleged abuse was clearly erroneous. In effect, defendant was contending that his mental condition had progressed beyond mere mental illness to insanity as defined in S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-1-2(20), and if that was so, his guilty but mentally ill plea under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-1-2(24) was not appropriate. When the trial court questioned defendant about the guilty plea, he repeatedly asserted that he did not know that he was doing anything wrong at the time of the alleged abuse. The two psychiatrists' reports contained only minimal information about defendant's state of mind at the time of the alleged abuse and did not establish that defendant knew right from wrong at the time of the alleged abuse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on an accident report from a witness, defendant was confronted at his home and placed under arrest for driving with a revoked license. The trooper administered a series of field sobriety tests and a preliminary breath test to defendant, then arrested defendant for DWI. Defendant's motion to suppress evidence was denied based on the trial court's conclusion that the trooper had exigent circumstances allowing him to enter defendant's trailer and make the warrantless arrest. He was convicted of fourth offense DWI. On appeal, the court remanded the action for a determination whether the trooper's entry into defendant's residence was consensual. The record did not support the contention that exigent circumstances permitted the trooper's warrantless entry into defendant's residence. Defendant's father indicated that defendant was at home and was not injured from the accident. The trooper could not have legitimately believed that defendant was in need of any immediate aid to protect his life or to avoid serious injury. A warrantless home arrest could not be justified simply because evidence of defendant's blood alcohol level might dissipate while the trooper obtained a warrant.</SPAN></P>

The fact that the State distinguished between debtors for garnishment exemption purposes did not render the classification unreasonable or patently arbitrary. Ensuring that debtors could not fully escape their debts was a legitimate governmental purpose. The court refused to consider the debtor's other constitutional challenge because it was raised for the first time on appeal.

The Secretary mailed a notice of intent to audit and a request that the contractors provide their books. When the contractors refused to comply with the Secretary's request, the trial court entered a judgment of contempt against them. The contractors sought review. Pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-45-45, because the contractors were engaged in a taxable business, they were required to maintain records, receipts, and invoices relating to the conduct of such business. The court found that the Secretary was authorized, under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-59-5 to investigate the contractors' business. The court determined the records requested by the Secretary were open to inspection and were not protected by the Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. The court found that the statute was not void for vagueness because a person of ordinary intelligence understood its meaning. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bank sought review from the denial of its motion for summary judgment by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Judicial Court Marshall County (South Dakota). The motion was in an action wherein the bank sought to quiet title to real property it had acquired as a result of a tax deed proceeding. The trial court held that the tax deed notice statute,&nbsp;S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-25-3, was unconstitutional and held in favor of appellee lienholders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In denying the bank's motion for summary judgment, the trial court held that South Dakota's statutory scheme for taking tax deeds was constitutionally deficient because it failed to provide notice to the lienholders. The court agreed affirmed. The lienholders were entitled to notice of the tax deed proceedings. Failure to give notice of tax deed proceedings to those entitled thereto was a jurisdictional defect that tolled the statute of limitations until the notice was received. At the time of the action S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-23-3 did not require that notice be sent to all known or reasonably ascertainable judgment creditors. It did not even provide for notice by publication. Therefore, &sect;10-25-3, in its prior form, was unconstitutional. The court directed that the holding be applied prospectively only. Recognizing that over the past years several thousand acres of land had been acquired in the State through a good faith compliance with, and reliance upon, tax deed notice procedures, which the court found to be unconstitutional, substantial detriment could occur were the holding to be given retroactive application.</SPAN></P>

The seller's claim for punitive damages was stricken from their complaint. The court affirmed the trial court's finding that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 21-1-4.1 was applicable to the sellers' claim for punitive damages based on fraud and deceit because the required preliminary showing of willful, wanton, or malicious conduct for a fraud claim was the same intent required for all punitive damages claims. The statute was applicable retroactively because it was procedural where it regulated discovery by requiring the establishment of a reasonable basis for punitive damages and did not alter the standard required to recover such damages. The court reversed the trial court's ruling that the statute precluded the sellers from seeking punitive damages because, although it properly applied the complicity rule of principle liability for the acts of its agent, the sellers presented facts that suggested that the realtor was reckless in employing the agent, and that the agent's use of the realtor's office and stationery perpetuated the apparent fraud.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The intervenor challenged the application and requested that an environmental impact statement (EIS) be made for the proposed facility. Hearings were held and ultimately a permit was granted. The intervenor appealed from the lower court's affirmance of the board's grant of the permit, contending that the hearing chairperson erred when he denied its request for an EIS. Because the intervenor did not allege any specific facts to support its request for an EIS, the court held that it could not find that the hearing chairperson abused his discretion in denying the request for an EIS. The court rejected the intervenor's claim that there was ex parte communication that denied it due process. However, the board's statement that granting the permit was in the public interest did not meet the statutory requirements that the facts underlying this determination be stated; thus, the court reversed this finding and remanded that matter for further consideration. Because the permit conditions failed to satisfy the standards of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 1-26-25, this finding was also reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued in part that the state made the contractors' excise tax on federal contracts retroactive to 1984, that its contracts were not realty improvement contracts, and that the use tax could not be assessed on materials provided by the government. The court affirmed the dismissal of the taxpayer's complaint. The court held that the 1988 amendment to &sect; 10-46A-2.2 was merely curative legislation designed to remove ambiguities raised by the 1984 amendment and that, although the 1988 amendment retroactively clarified the 1984 amendment, it was not so harsh or burdensome as to transgress constitutional limitations. The court held that the contracts were subject to the contractors' excise tax because the electrical equipment was intended to remain where affixed until worn out, until the purpose to which the realty was devoted was accomplished, or until it was replaced by a more suitable item. The court found that when the taxpayer installed and was paid for installing materials furnished by the government, it used the materials within the meaning of &sect; 10-46 and that the state's tax scheme did not burden interstate commerce under the Complete Auto Transit test.</SPAN></P>

Upon seeing defendant in the living room and recognizing him as the man who had accompanied the suspect to pick up a package of cocaine, an officer took defendant into custody. The officer found the suspect's wife attempting to hide the cocaine in a closet. Defendant was searched and a vial of cocaine was found in his pocket. After he was charged with possession of cocaine, defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized from his pocket. The trial court granted defendant's motion. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that defendant's arrest was valid under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-3-2(2) because his arrest was adequately supported by probable cause and was, therefore, valid. The police clearly had cause to believe defendant was involved in the receipt and possession of the cocaine where they knew the suspect had received a package of cocaine, defendant accompanied the suspect to pick up the cocaine, and defendant was at the suspect's residence where cocaine was found. Thus, the search of defendant's pockets was a valid search incident to his arrest and the evidence seized was admissible at trial.</SPAN></P>

He was also charged with having been convicted of three prior felonies. Defendant pled guilty to the prior felony part of the information and admitted to being an habitual offender. Defendant's convictions for escape and aggravated assault were reversed. There was no ruling on whether the prior convictions used to enhance defendant's penalty were valid. Neither the State nor defendant appealed that decision. Defendant was retried and convicted again. The trial court refused to grant a retrial on the habitual offender information and took judicial notice of defendant's prior felonies. On review, the court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to dismiss that part of the information accusing defendant of being an habitual offender.

Defendant had been charged with keeping a place for use or sale of controlled substances in violation of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-42-10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover police agent allegedly purchased illegal drugs from the co-tenant at defendant's apartment on three occasions, and the State claimed that defendant was present in the apartment on two of these three occasions. Section 22-42-10 did require defendant to know that persons using illegal drugs were using her place. The trial court held that the omission of the element of knowledge was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court disagreed and held that &quot;knowledge&quot; was an essential element of the offense by way of statutory construction. Legislative acts that were essentially public welfare regulatory measures could omit the knowledge element without violating substantive due process guarantees. Noting that lesser statutory drug offenses contained the element of knowledge, the court opined that it was anomalous to hold that the legislature intended to require a lesser burden of proof on the part of the State for those offenses carrying a more serious maximum possible penalty. Moreover, the State did not contend that knowledge was not an element of the offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant downstream irrigator sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of the Fifth Judicial Circuit, Marshall County (South Dakota), which affirmed the decision of the Water Management Board to extend the time for construction of an irrigation works under a water permit. The Board determined that &quot;exigent circumstances&quot; existed under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 46-5-26 and extended the time for construction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board found that exigent circumstances excused the failure of certain parties from applying for an extension. The irrigator intervened because the extension would have adversely affected the priority of his own water permits. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the Board had jurisdiction to consider permit amendments to extend filed after the original five-year period because the permit had not expired as it had not been cancelled under Board rules. Water rights could not be forfeited for nonuse without a due process hearing pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 46-5-37.1. The Board's interpretation of the &quot;exigent circumstances&quot; provision as &quot;extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to the control of the person seeking the extension,&quot; was consonant with legislative intent and not beyond the scope of its authority. However, the exigent circumstances found by the Board, namely, the relevant parties' age, health, and stress, did not justify their failure to file for an extension within the original period because the circumstances identified had not prevented the parties from promptly attending to their other business affairs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the part of the circuit court's decision that held that the Board had authority to consider permit amendments to extend filed after the original five-year period. The court reversed the portion of the circuit court's decision that held that the permit could be amended to extend the time for completion of construction based on exigent circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff fur producers appealed the order of the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit, Minnehaha County (South Dakota), which denied their motion, brought pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 21-1-4.1, to allow discovery relating to punitive damages in their action against defendants for breach of contract, fraud, false pretenses, and conspiracy incident to defendants' solicitation of the producers to enter their rabbit fur business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court opined, without reading the contracts, that most of the producers' evidence in support of their discovery motion related to the issue of breach of contract. Consequently, the circuit court concluded that the producers failed to establish that there was a reasonable basis to believe that defendants engaged in willful, wanton, or malicious conduct, as required by S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 21-1-4.1. On appeal, the court disagreed with the circuit court's analysis. A defendant's testimony disclosed that a promise to buy a large volume of pelts from the producers was not included in the contracts and that defendants never intended to buy the pelts. Further, the defense testimony did not refute that of the producers and a former sales representative for the business regarding the representations that defendants made to induce the producers to contract with the business. Thus, the defense testimony and admissions evidenced willful conduct sufficient to establish a reasonable basis for a fraud claim, and it was error to deny the producers' discovery motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's order denying the producers' motion for discovery relating to punitive damages and remanded the matter to the circuit court for proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was placed on probation after he pleaded guilty to a charge of intentionally damaging property. He was subsequently arrested for disorderly conduct and assaulting a jailer. The Circuit Court of the Eighth Judicial Circuit, Butte County (South Dakota), allowed defendant to change his plea to a plea of guilty but mentally ill, revoked his probation, and sentenced him to four years' incarceration. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a condition of his probation, defendant was required to obey all laws and to continue taking medication for bipolar disorder. When he was subsequently arrested, the trial court twice asked for psychiatric evaluations; defendant was found to be suffering from bipolar disorder but was otherwise determined to be mentally competent. Defendant successfully asked to withdraw his original guilty plea after the trial court found him guilty of violating his probation; he was allowed to substitute a plea of guilty but mentally ill under S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 23A-7-2(5), 23A-27-38. Defendant appealed after his probation was revoked. He asserted that the trial court's findings were not supported by the evidence and claimed that he was not adequately informed when he entered his plea. In affirming, the court held that defendant did not have to be convicted of a collateral offense in order to have his probation revoked. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that he had broken the law. Defendant's mental condition did not make him incompetent to plead guilty. The record showed that defendant's plea had been knowingly and intelligently made.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that delivering water was not an inherently governmental activity, and that S.D.

The court also held that, as a business enterprise with a commercial purpose, the water user district could not invoke the state's sovereign immunity as a shield from damages that arose in contract or in tort. The court further determined that the attempted extension of governmental immunity under S.D.

On appeal, the court reversed the DUI conviction but affirmed the conviction for failing to display a current registration. The court held that South Dakota had no jurisdiction on the reservation and, thus, the fresh pursuit statute could not reach there. However, the court held that the trial court had jurisdiction for the purposes of trial because defendant committed a crime off the reservation and then fled back onto it. The court held that there existed independent evidence of defendant's failure to display current registration, based on the officer's observations prior to the pursuit and arrest, which could sustain his conviction for that offense. On the other hand, the court held that the officer committed a constitutional violation by pursuing defendant back onto the reservation and not turning him over to the tribal authorities first.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealer contracted with the customer for the installation of an irrigation system. The parts were purchased from the supplier, assembled by the dealer, and were covered by the manufacturers' warranties. When problems arose in the system, only some of the problems were reported to the supplier. Plaintiff bankruptcy trustees for the customer filed an action against the dealer, who filed a third-party action against the supplier. The trial court granted summary judgment for the supplier based on the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) statute of limitations for the sale of goods, and on appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court correctly applied S.D.

After reviewing the caselaw in many jurisdictions on the application of the UCC statute of limitations to indemnity claims, the court concluded that in South Dakota, a party seeking indemnity had to be free of wrong doing, which was not the case here. The customer and the dealer had ample opportunity to exercise their contract rights to correct any warranty problems before the limitations period had run.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant illegitimate child challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of the Fifth Judicial Circuit, Walworth County (South Dakota) in favor of appellee executrixes in a will contest. The child contended S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 29-1-15 was unconstitutional and that he was a pretermitted heir under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 29-6-10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testate decedent never acknowledged the child. First, the court held that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 29-1-15 was not unconstitutional as violative of equal protection. The classification of illegitimate children served a legitimate state purpose. The court held that the child was required to show that he was either legitimized under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-6-1 or acknowledged in writing before a competent witness under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 29-1-15 before he could seek to establish that his omission from decedent's will was unintentional. The trial court, after hearing the facts of the case, made the determination that the decedent never signed any sort of written acknowledgement naming the child as his son. The court also reasoned that the child had failed to establish that the decedent adopted and legitimized him pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-6-1. Therefore, the child was not entitled to inherit from the decedent under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 29-6-10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment against the child was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant farmer sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of the Eighth Judicial Circuit, Meade County (South Dakota) which granted appellee bank's motion for summary judgment. The farmer sought damages from the bank, contending that that bank's replevin action was invalid for failure to comply with S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 21-15 and that the sale of his livestock and machinery was not conducted in a commercially reasonable manner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank initiated a replevin action pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 21-15, due to the farmer's refusal to deliver collateral to the bank after his apparent default on notes. The trial court struck the farmer's answer because an unlicensed attorney signed it and orally entered a default judgment. The trial court then issued an order for the immediate replevin of all the farmer's livestock and farm machinery. The bank sold the goods and sought a deficiency judgment. The farmer brought an action for damages against the bank. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the bank, finding that the bank complied with the requirements of the replevin statutes and that the farmer's other claims were compulsory counterclaims that should have been raised in the replevin action. The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgement for the bank in the farmer's action, with the excerption of the farmer's claim that the sale of his livestock and farm machinery was not commercially reasonable. The court concluded that, since the court's order striking the farmer's answer was not in writing, the farmer was entitled to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in all respects, except as to the issue of whether the sale of the farmer's livestock and farm machinery was done in a commercially reasonable manner. The court, therefore, remanded the case for further consideration on that issue.</SPAN></P>

The attorney general noted that the media's application sought in part, a declaration that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 26-8-34 was an unconstitutional prior restraint upon the media's First Amendment right to a free press.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to S.C. Codified Laws &sect; 26-8-34, the order of closure prevented the media from publishing the names of any witnesses. The attorney general maintained that the court was without jurisdiction to hear the case because the media never complied with the statutory notice requirements of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 15-6 for suit against a state officer and for challenging the constitutionality of a state statute. The court found that the failure of the circuit court to appear as a party did not result in a default. The case was an original action in the court and thus S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 15-6-4(d)(8) did not apply. The court concluded that the order was not moot. The court further concluded that the order for closure was invalid, and that it could not have been upheld. The same stringent terms were equally applied to the other participants in the adjudicatory hearing and were not carefully tailored to limit their effect for the protection of the purported victim. And the order violated the statutory requirements for enforcement of contempt. The adjudicatory hearing was over, the order for closure was rescinded, and, therefore, it was not a matter of existing emergency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a peremptory writ of mandamus against the circuit court commanding it to rescind its order of closure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father brought an action in South Dakota to enforce a Kansas child support order. The trial court indicated its intent to apply S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-7-7 in setting a mother's future child support obligation and also indicated its intent to deviate from those standards in setting the amount of future support, due to the circumstances of the mother and her new husband. The trial court established the amount of the child support arrearage, raised the mother's future support obligation, and refused to credit monies that she had paid directly against the arrearage. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court ruled that because the mother was a resident of South Dakota, under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-9A-6, the trial court had the authority to apply the laws of this state to set the mother's future support obligation. This was true even though the order being modified was the judgment of another state court. The court did hold, however, that the trial court should have required the witnesses to testify in open court because their affidavits as to the facts were in conflict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portion of the order of the trial court that established the mother's arrearage in child support and reversed the portion of the order that set her prospective obligation for support.</SPAN></P>

As a result of media attention, the three juveniles moved for a closure of proceedings pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect;26-8-32. The trial court granted their motion to close the adjudicatory portion of the juvenile proceedings. The media appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The incident involved an alleged rape of a minor at the governor's residence. The trial court found that newspaper and electronic media coverage in South Dakota was widespread and pervasive and that the media coverage had become nationwide, excessive, and sensational. The court agreed that closure was proper. The sensationalistic treatment of this matter on national television and the numerous state newspaper articles clearly supported closure. Although the media had obtained the name of one of the juveniles, the name was not disclosed through the trial court and the other juveniles, as well as the minor victim, were still entitled to protection. The trial court made sufficient efforts to provide an alternative to closure, but these attempts were rejected by the media. The order of closure was temporary, not permanent, because it applied only to the adjudicatory portion of the proceeding. By conditioning the media's access to the juvenile proceedings on its compliance with S.D. Codified Laws &sect;26-8-34, the trial court in no way prohibited or restrained the media from publishing any information. The constitutionality of &sect;26-8-34 was not in issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order closing the adjudicatory portion of the juveniles' hearing.</SPAN></P>

At jail, defendant was informed that blood would be drawn for testing purposes. Defendant resisted the test and had to be restrained while blood was drawn. Analysis showed that defendant was drunk. On appeal from a trial court decision upholding the involuntary test, the court held that it was reasonable for police to force defendant to submit to a test performed by a certified medical technologist with reasonable physical force. Blood samples were not subject to the exclusionary rule when taken incident to a lawful arrest in a reasonable manner. Second, the elimination of alcohol from the body was an exigent circumstance obviating the need for a warrant. Finally, S.D.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff who was injured while lifting weights appealed an order granting summary judgment to defendant superintendent, school board members, and coaches. Plaintiff argued that defendants permitted an unauthorized and unlawful conditioning program without proper supervision in school facilities. The trial court granted motions of summary judgment in favor of all defendants on the grounds of sovereign immunity. School board members and employees were immune from suit, either as board members or individuals, if they did not act in excess of their lawful authority or commit intentional torts. The board was entitled to sovereign immunity because it delegated the executive and supervisory authority of the school facilities to the superintendent and, therefore, had no duty to supervise the weight-lifting program. The superintendent was protected under sovereign immunity because he secured fully licensed and certified coaches to run the program. The coaches were immune from suit because they were acting within the scope of the employment when plaintiff was injured and plaintiff had been instructed on the use of appropriate weight-lifting techniques. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

When the officer was informed through a records check that defendant had two prior convictions in the last five years for driving while under the influence, defendant was not given the option of refusing a blood test. S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-10 revoked the right to refuse to submit to a blood alcohol test after two violations of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-1. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress the blood test results on the ground that S.D.

The court stated that the officer's initial determination that defendant was being arrested for a third violation of S.D.

The court held that the circuit court's order was invalid because it lacked jurisdiction when the administratrix failed to timely file the application for a refund pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-41-84. Because the administratrix failed to file the refund application within three-years, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to consider the matter. Further, the court agreed with the Department that the three-year statute of limitation was not tolled by the minor's minority pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 15-2-22. Section 15-2-22 did not apply to toll the running of the statute of limitation because the minor's right to a refund never arose. The right to a refund was subject to a condition, filing an application for refund within three years. The administratrix failed to file for a refund within the prescribed time period.</SPAN></P>

Codified Laws &sect; 34-1-20, as amended by 1988 S.D. Laws ch. 273 (H.B. 1272), was constitutional. The HMO had filed a declaratory judgment action against defendant State to determine the validity of &sect; 34-1-20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The HMO had refused to allow chiropractors and optometrists to provide basic services under their plan. The chiropractors and optometrists were instrumental in getting legislation passed that required where State funds were used for any public health program there could be no restrictions for the selection of any regularly licensed physician, chiropractors, or optometrists. The HMO sought a declaratory judgment regarding the validity of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 34-1-20, as amended. The trial court determined that 1988 S.D. Laws ch. 273 (H.B. 1272) was constitutional. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that the amendment violated S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 21, which required a law to contain one subject to be expressed in its title. The title of H.B. 1272 specified that it was to provide for nondiscrimination in the use of public funds for public employees. However, the legislation actually discriminated against all &quot;practitioners of the healing arts&quot; except physicians, optometrists, and chiropractors due to the change in S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 34-1-20. The vast narrowing of &sect; 34-1-20 could not be gleaned from the title of H.B. 1272.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When they were divorced, the parties were in good health, had two children, and owned a farming operation. The husband had an eighth grade education and was engaged in a profitable farming business. The wife had worked at a library until she gave birth to the parties' first child. Thereafter, the wife did not return to work outside the home, but contributed to the operation of the farm by occasionally helping with the chores and performing necessary bookkeeping tasks. The trial court determined the marital assets to be $ 261,642; the liabilities to be $ 157,328; and determined that the husband brought $ 13,000 in assets to the marriage. Out of the balance of $ 91,314, the wife was awarded $ 25,000 as her share and was awarded $ 400 per month in rehabilitative alimony. The court affirmed in part as to the valuation of the parties' real property, but reversed and remanded in part as to the division of property and alimony. The court held that the trial court made errors in calculations and valuation. The issue of child support was remanded because the court was unable to determine how the trial court arrived at the award. Finally, the court awarded the wife attorney fees on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the terms of the parties' divorce agreement, the wife was granted custody of the parties' minor child and the husband was required to pay child support. The husband was employed as a real estate agent and the parties' stipulation required him to pay 15 percent of his gross earnings as child support. The husband fell behind on his support payments. The wife filed a motion for show cause seeking support arrearages. The husband filed a petition urging the trial court to retroactively reduce his support obligations. The trial court denied his request and entered a judgment against the husband for his support arrearages. The court determined that the payments for which the husband sought modification had accrued prior to the filing of his petition. S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-7-7.3 prohibited modification of payments that accrued prior to the filing of a petition for modification. The husband also contended that the trial court erred by not calculating his gross earnings by using the amount shown as his total income on his tax returns. The court concluded that based on the parties' agreement the trial court correctly computed the husband's support obligation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, but remanded the case back to the trial court for correction of an addition error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In previous litigation, the father's paternity of the child was determined, the father was awarded custody, and the father's request for child support from the mother was denied.

On review, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by not ordering the mother to pay child support when she was then unemployed, her husband was then unemployed, she was caring for her two other children, and she provided transportation and support for the child when he visited her, and where the father and his new spouse had income and one less person in their household.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient filed an intermediate appeal from a summary judgment entered against him by the Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit, Pennington County (South Dakota), in his medical malpractice action against the estate of defendant doctor. He contended that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 15-2-22.1 (1977) did not apply retroactively to his case and that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient filed the action at age 18 and alleged that the doctor committed malpractice by prescribing certain drugs until the patient was 10 years old. The circuit court held that &sect; 15-2-22.1, entitled medical malpractice limitation applicable to minors aged six or over, was the applicable statute of limitations and that it barred the patient's malpractice action. In considering the patient's appeal, the court first ruled that the circuit court properly applied the statute retroactively. The court further ruled, however, that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Under the rational basis test, which was the most appropriate test in an age classification case, the statute created a classic arbitrary classification of minors with medical malpractice claims as opposed to minors with any other kind of tort claim. The court also ruled that there was no rational basis for the arbitrary classification, which the court concluded was for a legitimate basis, namely to alleviate the malpractice crisis. There was no rational basis for thinking that the number of claims would have lessened by requiring earlier filing of actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's grant of summary judgment for the doctor, and it remanded the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an abuser of alcohol and drugs, began experiencing behavioral changes when he attempted to quit the use of all chemical substances cold turkey.

A nurse informed him that he could leave voluntarily, but first needed the permission of a doctor. While waiting for a doctor, defendant became agitated and violent and attacked a security guard. Defendant contended that there was insufficient evidence to prove the specific intent element of the offense of aggravated assault and to prove that he was mentally ill, as opposed to insane, when he committed the crime. The court found that defendant gave considerable evidence from which the jury could have made its determination that he knew what he was doing and the wrongfulness of such acts. The testimony of other witnesses was sufficient for the jury to determine that defendant was mentally ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties' original divorce decree ordered that the ex-husband was to pay $ 225 per month in child support for their minor child. Years later, the ex-wife filed a petition for modification of child support and, after an administrative hearing, the ex-husband's payments were increased to $ 361 per month. Upon rehearing, the ex-husband was ordered to pay $ 435.58 in child support. The trial court reduced the ex-husband's child support to $ 361 per month and awarded him a federal income tax exemption. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that it was error for the trial court to defer ruling on the income tax exemptions but to refer the case to the Department of Social Services for determination of child support because allocation of the tax exemption affected the financial situation of the parties and constituted a factor in determining ability to pay child support. Pursuant to 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 152(e), the custodial parent, the ex-wife, was to receive the tax exemption, subject to three exceptions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly committed the crimes so that he could use the judicial system as a forum to express his views on the federal monetary system. Defendant created a fraudulent commercial trust company to deceive the victims in the hope that they would eventually bring an action against him in civil court. The jury found defendant guilty of grand theft by deception and attempted grand theft by deception. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court properly granted the state's motion to preclude certain evidence to restrict defendant's use of the trial as his own political forum. Moreover, the exclusion was proper because defendant's challenge to the federal monetary system was not a defense that the jury could properly consider in a criminal case. The court determined that &sect; 22-30A-3(1) was neither vague nor ambiguous. Accordingly, the fact that defendant did not know of &sect; 22-30A-3(1), did not believe his actions were wrong, or was driven by his own good intentions was immaterial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the South Dakota Commission on Human Rights and a teenage baseball program, challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit, Fall River County, South Dakota, which reversed a decision of the Commission in favor of the program in a sexual discrimination action filed by appellee claimant, a teenage girl. The trial court directed that the claimant be allowed to play on any team within the program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was prohibited from playing in a state baseball tournament on the basis that girls were ineligible. The claimant filed an action against the program for sexual discrimination. The Commission dismissed the complaint on the grounds that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 20-13-22.1(2) exempted the program from the provisions of the Human Rights Act, S.D. Codified Laws ch. 20-13, because the program was sponsored by a veterans organization. On appeal, the circuit court reversed the Commission and found that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 20-13-22.1(2) was an unconstitutional deprivation of equal protection. On appeal by the Commission and the program, the court reversed. The court held that &sect;20-13-22.1(2) was not unconstitutional. Viewing &sect;20-13-22.1 in its entirety, the court found a legislative intention to exempt a wide range of programs, self-contained and sponsored by a variety of organizations that had been operating in South Dakota for many years prior to the enactment of the Act. Thus, the exemption was not arbitrary. Also, the exemption did not violate S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 23(9) as a private or special law because it was not specifically limited to veterans organizations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation alleged that it was exempt from paying a special tax on fuel burned in hot-mix plants it owned and operated during highway construction projects. The tax department argued that the corporation was liable based on an administrative regulation. On appeal the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-48-3(1) created an exemption to the special fuel tax imposed by S.D. Codified Laws &sect;10-48-2 for special fuel purchased by a person for non-highway use who did not own or operate a special fuel-powered vehicle that was propelled by the same fuel type as that being purchased in bulk or who complied with S.D.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexually abusing one of his two minor children. On appeal, the court found that the indictment was not unconstitutionally vague, particularly in light of the fact that the trial court granted defendant's alternative motion for a bill of particulars, because it contained the elements of the offense charged, informed defendant of the charge against him, and enabled defendant to plead an acquittal of the conviction and bar future prosecutions. In addition, the indictment did not have to be dismissed on the grounds that it was based solely on hearsay evidence presented to the grand jury because the trial court could not inquire into the legality or sufficiency of the evidence upon which the indictment was based. Finally, although the court found that certain questions asked by the State of the alleged victim, which led to an answer referencing alleged improper conduct between defendant and his other minor child, were asked in bad faith, the trial court properly admonished the jury and the answer was related to the rape charge on which defendant was acquitted. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court rendered a judgment that terminated the alimony of the ex-wife based on her remarriage. The trial court also increased the child-support obligation of the ex-husband. The ex-wife appealed to the court and petitioned for attorney fees for the appeal. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and denied the fees. According to the court, proof that the ex-wife had remarried established a prima facie case that required the trial court to terminate the alimony payments unless extraordinary circumstances justified a continuation. The original alimony award did not contain an agreement that alimony would continue after her remarriage. The ex-wife argued that she had not profited economically from her remarriage and that she needed the alimony to live the pre-divorce lifestyle to which she had become accustomed. The court rejected the contention that this was an extraordinary circumstance. Regarding child support, the court ruled that the trial court had properly excluded from the ex-husband's monthly income rental income and interest income that he did not receive but that were utilized to keep his truck-stop business in a reasonable state of repair.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former wife sought increased child support. After arriving at the support amount for two children based on the father's income, appellants argued that &sect; 25-7-7 was unconstitutional. The trial court held that it was constitutional and the court affirmed, holding that the statute was constitutional even though the children of the first marriage received priority in child support. The state had an interest in protecting the welfare of children, including their standard of living. Section 25-7-7 served to prevent a drop in the children's standard of living when their parents divorced and it provided uniform standards for determining the amount of child support. Although the application of &sect; 25-7-7 could have resulted in the children of the second marriage receiving a lesser amount of economic support than the children of the first marriage, under the rational basis standard, the support format of &sect; 25-7-7 provided a fair and logical prioritization of claims against a noncustodial parent's income. Without prioritization, the children from the first family could have found their standard of living substantially decreased by the voluntary acts of the father.</SPAN></P>

She appealed, challenging the admission of the evidence and an instruction regarding the breath to blood ratio used for the test. The circuit court agreed that the instruction was erroneous and vacated the conviction. On appeal by the State, the court reinstated the conviction. The court held that because the actual ratio in people varied significantly from the average used by the intoxilyzer test, it was error to give an instruction stating what the ratio was as a matter of state law.

The court affirmed the finding that the ordinances were valid. The court held that notice by publication was adequate and afforded due process for proposed enactments or changes in the zoning ordinances that affected the property owner. The court stated that in effectuating the purposes of the ordinance, the city had not acted arbitrarily and capriciously because the ordinance limited construction in flood plain districts to protect any future construction from increasing potential flood hazards, which was a legitimate municipal function.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant physician challenged an order of the Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial District, Hughes County (South Dakota), which upheld a decision of appellee South Dakota State Board of Medical and Osteopathic Examiners denying his application for a license to practice medicine, requested upon reciprocity without an examination. The physician claimed that he was denied due process and equal protection and that the Board's decision was arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician was licensed in Alabama by written examination, and obtained a Florida license two years later. He obtained Kentucky and Missouri licenses by reciprocity. His Florida license was revoked 15 years later, and he surrendered the Alabama license after he was convicted by a Florida federal jury of five felony counts of making false Medicare claims. His Missouri license was revoked and reinstated, but his application was based upon the Alabama examination grades even though he was not then licensed in Alabama. On review, the court found that the Board did not err in its determination after a hearing that pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 36-4-30, 36-4-19, and 36-4-11, it was not in the State's best interest to grant him a license because of unprofessional and dishonorable conduct. The court affirmed and found that the State had inherent police power to regulate the practice of medicine, that neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2, were offended by the Board's action, and that the Board did not act arbitrarily or capriciously because there was sufficient evidence showing his unprofessional behavior.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was subsequently found guilty but mentally ill (GBMI) and sentenced to prison. After his conviction was affirmed on appeal, appellant applied for a writ of habeas corpus. On appeal from the denial of his application, the court held that: (1) South Dakota's GBMI statutory scheme, S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-27-38, was not violative of due process merely because it did not assure treatment to an offender found GBMI because a prisoner was entitled to treatment only if a mental health provider concluded that treatment was medically necessary; and (2) appellant received adequate representation of counsel at his trial because defense counsel presented sufficient evidence for a jury to find that appellant was temporarily insane at the time the offense was committed, and defense counsel did not abandon the insanity defense in closing argument.</SPAN></P>

Defendant failed to establish a prima facie showing that his right under U.S. Const. amend.

Specifically, the court held that to support defendant's conviction on six counts, originating from &sect; 26-10-1, there had to be a separate factual basis for each count, however, the language of the indictment led to the inescapable conclusion that the acts of torment charged therein merged with the acts of abuse. As such, the acts did not constitute separate offenses based on separate facts. Regardless, the court found that &sect; 26-10-1 was not easily susceptible of misinterpretation and it was not unconstitutionally vague.

The court determined that because defendants were detained with probable cause, the court did not need to examine the issue of whether or not the acquisition of the mail receipts from the sheriff's wastebasket amounted to a search. The search of the female defendant's purse, which garnered the pawn shop business card, was likewise upheld as a valid search. The court affirmed the trial court's decision on the motion to suppress. Defendants did not request the trial court to admonish the jury to disregard the remark, nor did they file a motion for a mistrial. Therefore, the trial court did not have an opportunity to make a decision from which there could have been an abuse of discretion. The record reflected that the trial court did carefully follow the mandate of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-24-5 at every other adjournment. The court found no indication that this minor omission affected the verdict. Accordingly, the court affirmed defendants' convictions for grand theft and burglary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Board of Regents sought both alternative and peremptory writs of prohibition against the circuit court judge on the grounds that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over a labor dispute which had not previously been filed with the Department of Labor. The dispute arose out of the Regents attempt to demand that individual contract offers to faculty members be signed and returned after the Regents and the bargaining agent for the faculty members failed to negotiate a new master contract for the year. The court held that the Regents were entitled to the requested peremptory writ of prohibition and ruled that the circuit court's previous writ had to be dissolved in order to enable the Regents to carry on their immediate task or ensuring a fully staffed and qualified faculty when the school year started. The court found that the faculty's bargaining agent had failed to show that it had suffered immediate and irreparable harm because of the actions of the Regents. As such, the court ruled that the Regent's actions were not, as a matter of law, an unfair labor practice under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 3-18-3.1, and the agent was required to exhaust its administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit, Pennington County (South Dakota), which revoked his probation for violation of various conditions imposed by the trial court. The trial court imposed a maximum 15-year prison sentence, suspending the last five years of the sentence under similar conditions to those previously imposed. Defendant pleaded guilty to aggravated assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, in a highly intoxicated state, entered a bingo parlor and held a rifle to the head of the victim. After the guilty plea, the trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed defendant on probation for 10 years upon the conditions of good behavior and obeyance of all laws, satisfactory completion of alcohol treatment, and that defendant not possess any gun, firearm, or other offensive weapon. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that defendant's conduct was not as good as required by the imposed conditions of probation. Defendant's behavior was sufficient to demonstrate that he could have been charged or convicted of assault and his conduct did not conform to the law. The court found sufficient evidence that defendant failed to complete an alcohol treatment program. The trial court's determination that a pocket knife was an offensive weapon, as contemplated by its own probation order, was not clearly erroneous. The use of the term &quot;offensive weapon&quot; by the trial court was sufficient to notify defendant that he could not conceal objects which by design were capable of causing injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment adjudicating her as a juvenile delinquent. Under S.D.

The court determined that there was no evidence that when the minor entered the store with her aunt she had the intent to commit a crime inside. The court determined that the word &quot;remained&quot; in &sect; 22-32-2 meant to unlawfully remain in a structure. Therefore, the minor did not commit second degree burglary because the minor entered an occupied structure and after entry, while lawfully in the store, formed the intent to commit an offense. Accordingly, the state concluded that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the allegations in the state's petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were married for 32 years and during their marriage they accumulated personal and real property. Moreover, the parties received a large personal injury settlement as result of an automobile accident. The wife was the person who was most seriously injured in the automobile accident. On appeal, the wife argued that the trial court erred by not granting her a lump sum settlement equal to the proceeds received in settlement of the personal injury action. Specifically, the wife contended that the trial court was incorrect in finding that the personal injury award was too remote in time and too long merged in the parties' joint assets to be considered a distributable asset. The court held that four years was not too remote under these circumstances and that settlement proceeds were marital property subject to distribution. However, the court held that whether the distribution constituted an abuse of discretion depended on the division of all the property. After examining the evidence, the court held that the trial court's property distribution and alimony award did not amount to an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accident victims alleged, inter alia, that the bar's negligence in continuing to serve alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person contributed further to the drunk driver's intoxication and to their injuries. The trial court granted summary judgment to the bar on the ground that S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 35-11-1, 35-4-78 (amended 1985) effectively abrogated the cause of action against a liquor licensee and his employees when they continued to serve an intoxicated person. The accident victims argued that the legislature could not abrogate by statute a cause of action recognized by the court. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for trial. The task of determining the proximate cause of injuries in individual cases was the duty of the courts, not of the legislature. The legislative finding in S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 35-11-1 was not effective to abrogate the court's rule that violation of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 35-4-78 (prior to amendment) constituted negligence as a matter of law. Despite the amendment to &sect; 35-4-78, the statute continued to provide a standard of care, the breach of which continued to give rise to a cause of action against wrongdoers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed decision and order that was adopted by Secretary set the father's support obligation at more than double the father's voluntary payment amount by applying the guideline table in S.D.

The father argued that the Secretary abused his discretion in not deviating from the guideline table and not taking into consideration the father's financial condition and the mother's spouse's income; either consideration could have justified a downward deviation. There could be no deviation from the guidelines of &sect;25-7-7 unless there was an entry of specific findings regarding the five listed factors, which had to be considered in every case. The Secretary chose not to consider any of the deviations because there was no specific finding of deviation and the support was set within the initial guidelines table. The Secretary (and hearing examiner) abused his discretion in not considering a deviation from the guidelines due to a large student loan and other debts that affected the father's financial condition.

A second jury found that defendant had previously been convicted of two felonies and found him to be a habitual offender under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-7-7. The trial court sentenced defendant to two concurrent life terms. Later, defendant's felony conviction for burglary was overturned after it was found to be unconstitutional. Defendant filed a motion for dismissal of the action for default with the trial court and asked the trial court to vacate his habitual offender conviction. The trial court resentenced defendant to two concurrent life sentences. On appeal, the court affirmed and determined that the error of admitting the constitutionally infirm burglary conviction was harmless. The court found that defendant could still be convicted as a habitual offender for his prior conviction for interstate transportation of stolen property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother contacted a psychological counselor indicating that she was having problems with her children. The counselor learned that the mother had been abusing one of the children and inflicting physical harm on herself. Although the mother and father enrolled in parenting classes and marital counseling, the mother was committed for treatment for a psychological condition. Subsequently, an adjudicatory hearing was held. The trial court decreed that the children were dependent and neglected and terminated the rights of the mother and father. On appeal, the mother and father argued that the trial court allowed inadmissible hearsay at the hearing. The court determined that the hearsay testimony was cumulative because it was later proven by other evidence. There was clear and convincing evidence that the children lacked proper parental care and that they were threatened with substantial harm. An eventual return to the parents would have been inappropriate because the mother's condition was not expected to improve. Therefore, the court upheld the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant father appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit, Custer County (South Dakota), that modified a divorce decree to require him to pay child support until the child graduated from high school, which was slated to occur after the child turned 19. The action was brought in reliance upon S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-5-18.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the mother and father divorced, the father was awarded custody of the older children and the mother was granted custody of the younger children. When one of the older children was 18 years of age, the custody order was modified to permit him to live with his mother. The order also required the father to pay child support for the son until he graduated from high school, several months after he turned 19. On appeal, the court first admonished the mother for failing to file a brief on appeal. The court then held that &sect; 25-5-18.1, which required child support payments through the age of 19 for children attending high school, did not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the state and federal constitutions. Under the rational relationship test, the legislature might reasonably have concluded that once a child turned 19, he was old enough to be self-sufficient, even if still attending high school. The court concluded that the section did not authorize the award of child support to the son after he turned 19 when the parties did not agree to the award and there was no showing of need pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 25-5-20, 25-7-6. The judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded with directions to amend the order to remove the requirement that the father pay child support after the child turned 19 years of age.</SPAN></P>

After the prisoner was convicted of third degree burglary, he filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus claims that his arrest was made pursuant to an improperly issued &quot;Magistrate's Letter&quot; ordering him taken into custody and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel failed to move for a suppression of all evidence obtained in the course of the arrest. The trial court granted the writ. On appeal the court reversed, holding that: (1) the &quot;Magistrate's Letter&quot; improperly converted a fine into a term of imprisonment, but more than simple invalidity was required to successfully pursue an ineffective assistance of counsel claim; and (2) any deficiency on the part of counsel was nonprejudicial because the victim had a sufficient, independent recollection of the prisoner to make an in-court identification and the result of the trial would have been the same even if the motions to suppress were made.</SPAN></P>

The Board subsequently held, after a hearing, that the landowner's water right was cancelled on the ground of forfeiture. On appeal, the circuit court affirmed the Board's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and final decision. The court affirmed, holding that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 46-5-37 provided that failure to use all or any part of a water right for a period of three years resulted in a reversion to the public of all of such unused water, and that the landowner's subsequent use of the land in dispute did not revive his water right after a period of at least 18 years of nonuse.

Defendant did not request any hearing. The Department revoked defendant's driver's license for one year.

Upon receiving notice of the conviction, the Department revoked defendant's license for a period of one year to commence on the date of his second conviction.

The court found that (1) Rule 61:19:01:02 did not violate the Due Process Clause of the State and Federal Constitution because of vagueness; and (2) the Rule was not unreasonable because it denied a hearing for those persons denied a restricted license under the Rule.</SPAN></P>

On resentencing, the trial court allowed the State to produce evidence that defendant waived counsel at the prior conviction, and the trial court resentenced defendant on the enhancement. The court reversed, holding that the trial court denied defendant's double jeopardy rights provided by U.S. Const. amend. V and S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9. The double jeopardy clauses prohibited the resentencing of defendant where the State failed to provide sufficient evidence of habitual offender status at the first trial. Moreover, because defendant was once subjected to an enhancement proceeding, the double jeopardy clauses barred a second trial-like enhancement proceeding. The State failed its burden of proving that defendant either had counsel or waived his right to counsel. The enhancement portion of the information was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The inmate sought habeas relief based on his contentions that &sect; 24-15-5 was unconstitutional and that one of his prior convictions was for a misdemeanor and could not be taken into account in establishing his parole eligibility. The trial court agreed that the inmate should be considered only a two-time offender, but rejected the inmate's constitutional claims. On appeal, the inmate argued that &sect; 24-15-5 violated the equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions, because a second offender seeking parole was treated differently than a second offender facing sentencing. In affirming, the court held that since parole and sentencing were very different circumstances, the parties involved in the respective proceedings need not be governed by the same rule of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first asked that the court apply an Eighth Amendment proportionality review to the lifetime revocation of his driving privileges. The court stated that it would not extend such an analysis to the revocation. Defendant's driver's license was revoked for the protection of the public and not merely for the purpose of enhancing his punishment. Next, the trial court had not abused its discretion in revoking the license. In addition to felony convictions, mostly related to checks, defendant had 11 DUI convictions and had been arrested at least three times for driving without a license or with a suspended or revoked license. At sentencing, he appeared with a broken nose, the result of a drunken spree when he was free on bail. He had been hospitalized for alcohol treatment seven times since 1969. Under these circumstances, when defendant had demonstrated that he was not a likely candidate for rehabilitation, a lifetime revocation was reasonable under the police power of the State pursuant to S.D. Consolidated Laws &sect; 32-23-4. The court would not wait for defendant to become involved in a serious accident before approving the revocation of his license.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was charged, in a criminal action, with failure to file retail sales and service tax returns on his bookmaking operations. As part of the plea bargain which ensued, the taxpayer was to pay the tax, penalty and interest, keep adequate records, and pay taxes in the future based on his gross receipts. Pursuant to the plea bargain, the taxpayer paid some sales tax. The taxpayer litigated various issues related to the tax due and was unsuccessful in his attempts to recover the taxes paid. In the instant action, the trial court dismissed the taxpayer's suit to recover a refund of the sales tax he paid to the taxing authority on his bookmaking activities. In affirming, the court held that, as in a former action initiated by the taxpayer, the taxpayer based his suit upon the tax recovery statutes found in the South Dakota Codified Laws. The court held that the case at bar was identical to the former action. Thus, the court concluded that its decision in the former action was controlling, and that the taxpayer's recovery in the instant action was barred on the basis of res judicata.</SPAN></P>

Codified Laws &sect; 26-10-1, Abuse of or Cruelty to a Minor, a Class Four felony. Specifically, the indictment alleged that defendants, individually and conjointly, abused and tormented their three children by failing to furnish proper parental care and medical assistance. On appeal, defendants argued that severe neglect was not the equivalent of &quot;abuse&quot; or &quot;torment&quot; as was charged in the indictment. The reviewing court found that defendants' treatment of the children was cruel, inhumane, conducive to injury, and recurringly painful. The court held that defendants' conduct was abusive. The court rejected defendants' assertion that &sect; 26-10-1 was unconstitutionally vague. The court found no error in the jury instructions. Evidence that the mother attempted to fraudulently obtain welfare benefits was probative of her truthfulness or untruthfulness as permitted by S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 19-14-10. The trial court erred in admitting evidence concerning the mother's drug overdose while pregnant. However, given the overwhelming nature of the evidence of abuse, the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

For defendant to argue that the legislature only intended to protect the naked sexual organs of children while allowing the violation of others simply because their private parts were clothed, did violence to the legislature's intent and purpose in enacting S.D.

On appeal, the court affirmed as to the district holding that school districts were state agencies and, therefore, immune from tort liability. Reversing the grant of summary judgment as to the administrators, the court held that whether immunity extended to them depended upon whether they were acting within the scope of employment in the performance of a discretionary function.

Several years later, Defendant's supervising officer filed a petition to revoke the suspended imposition of sentence. The circuit court concluded that defendant had violated the terms of his probation by writing &quot;insufficient funds&quot; checks and revoked its order suspending the imposition of defendant's sentence. In response, defendant argued that his probation period exceeded the authorized maximum term of imprisonment. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contentions and affirmed the circuit court's judgment. The court held that the circuit court's discretion to set a probation period was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.

The court also found that the hospital was precluded from recovering where the out-of-state hospital had not previously filed a statement of costs, as required by S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 28-13-28. Although the hospital complied with the 15-day notice requirement, in accordance with the S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 28-13-33 and 28-13-34, the hospital did not comply with S.D.

The legislature's transfer of the university's trust land and funds to remaining state normal schools obviated any need for the citizens' requested relief. The citizens made no request for attorneys' fees in the complaint, but they requested fees upon remand. On appeal, the court held that they were not entitled to attorneys' fees. The general rule in the United States was that absent statutory exception, a litigant had to pay his own attorneys' fees, as codified in S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 15-17-6, - 7. Although there were common law exceptions to the rule, they were inapplicable because they were prohibited by &sect; 15-17-7.  Section 15-17-7 provided for attorneys' fees in the application of a trust administration, but the court held that the trusts referred to in &sect; 15-17-7 referred to S.D. Codified Laws ch. 21-22, dealing with administration of trusts estates, not the South Dakota educational trust fund. The educational remained a trust under the control and management of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The South Dakota Legislature enacted an emergency measure which transferred control of the university grounds and facilities from the Board to the Board of Charities and Corrections, and converted the school to a minimum security prison. The bill permitted the students to finish the academic year and required that the Board give the students an opportunity to complete their courses in South Dakota through articulation agreements and by including a baccalaureate program of vocational education within one of the institutions under their control. The students filed suit, alleging various civil rights and consumer protection causes of action. The trial court granted the Board summary judgment, and the court affirmed, holding that the students had no enforceable contract rights against the Board. The court noted that the students were permitted to complete the academic year for which they had paid tuition, and that the students did not develop any other contract rights with the Board. Moreover, the students were not entitled to an injunction because the bill's constitutionality was previously established, and the Board was not a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with burglary and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon; before trial he escaped from the county jail.

On appeal he claimed that it was error not to instruct the jury on mandatory commitment of defendants found not guilty by reason of insanity (NGBRI). In affirming his conviction, the court held that under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-26-12.5, although commitment was mandatory after a finding of NGBRI, a defendant so committed could be released almost immediately. The requested instruction would invite the jury to speculate and invite it to render a verdict on the basis of something other than the evidence before it. Defendant's argument that a GBMI verdict exposed him under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-27-38 to liberty deprivations greater than those faced by an offender who was merely found guilty was premature. A writ of habeas corpus was available for any unlawful detention; treatment for a mental condition was not cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction, arguing that &sect;32-4-13 was an ex post facto law as applied to him; that &sect;32-4-13 was vague and indefinite; and that jury deliberations from 10:15 p.m. to 4:35 a.m. the next day deprived him of a fair and impartial jury. The court held that &sect;32-4-13 was not an ex post facto law as applied to defendant because &sect;32-4-13 punished defendant not for the pre-1980 acts of putting stolen parts on his car, but for the continued violations that occurred after the enactment of &sect;32-4-13. Defendant violated the law after 1983 and therefore &sect;32-4-13 was not applied retroactively to him. Section 32-4-13 was not unconstitutionally vague because a statutory violation occurred when defendant was cognizant of certain facts that should have caused him to believe that his vehicles or parts were stolen or obscured. While starting the deliberations at 10:11 p.m. was too late to submit a felony case for deliberation, it did not rise to the level of reversible abuse of discretion or coercion because there were no complaints of fatigue, exhaustion, and weariness of jurors causing a coerced verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff railroad corporation appealed a judgment of the Seventh Judicial Circuit, Fall River County (South Dakota), granting the motion of defendant county treasurer and intervenor attorney general for judgment on the pleadings in the railroad's action seeking to recover certain taxes assessed under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-28-21.1 and paid under protest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad claimed that in spite of a 1981 amendment to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-28-21.1 they were entitled to tax credits for rehabilitation work done on their tracks. The railroad had made improvements to its lines and had certified these improvements after January 30, 1981, but prior to July 1, 1981. The amendment stated that its provisions did not affect credits certified prior its passage and approval. The governor signed the statute on January 30, 1981, which the court found constituted the approval referred to in the statute. The railroad argued that the effective date of the amendment was July 1, 1981. The court found that the passage and approval language of &sect; 10-28-21.1 was clear, certain, and unambiguous in its meaning and that there was no conflict with S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 22 or with S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 2-14-21 because S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-28-21.1 did not take effect until July 1, 1981 but merely stated that as of July 1, 1981, credits would be given for expenditures certified prior to January 30, 1981. The court found no taking because the railroad's interest in the tax credit was not a property right under S.D. Const. art. V, &sect; 13 or U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner filed an amended application for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that the language &quot;made from the stalk or seeds of a marijuana plant&quot; in count two was the state's definition of hashish under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 34-20B-1(10). Petitioner claimed that under the statutory definition, resin from the marijuana plant was classified as marijuana, not hashish. The motion court quashed the petition, and on appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the petition was barred by S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 21-27-16.1. The inadequacy of the definition of hashish had been considered in the previous postconviction proceeding. The res judicata doctrine applied to habeas corpus proceedings.

On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the magistrate was a de facto magistrate despite the fact that there was no appointment. A de facto officer was one who was surrounded with the insignia of office and seemed to act with authority. The court held that to constitute an officer de facto, it was not a necessary prerequisite that there had been an attempted exercise of competent or prima facie power of appointment or election. Here the court was concerned with reputation rather than acquiescence. It was not important whether each individual had accepted or rejected what the de facto judge had done, but rather, whether by virtue of continuous action the de facto magistrate's conduct was enforceable for all official acts she had performed. It was noted that the magistrate issued search warrants and performed other judicial acts. Thus, the police officer properly relied on the magistrate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One year after his first DWI conviction, the driver was again charged with violating S.D.

The trial court reversed the Department's revocation. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that &sect; 32-12-52.1 was ambiguous. The court found that reading the 1984 amendment to &sect; 32-12-52.1 in the conjunctive lead to an absurd and unreasonable conclusion that to trigger departmental action the trial court must have failed to impose the minimum statutory revocation and the individual must not have been charged and convicted consistent with departmental records. To clear up the ambiguity, the court interpreted the word &quot;and&quot; to mean or. Lastly, the court held that the South Dakota statutory scheme of license revocation without prior hearing, but subject to immediate appeal to the courts, did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied a motion for a new trial and awarded costs to the defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee was injured when a truck wheel exploded while he was remounting it after repairs. The employee sought damages from the wheel manufacturer, the lessor of the wheel and trailer it was attached to, and the lessee of the trailer on theories of products liability based on strict liability, breach of implied warranty, and negligence. The jury rendered a defense verdict. The court held that instructing the jury on a statute of limitations that had since been declared unconstitutional was reversible error. Instructions that the defendants were not liable if they complied with industry and government standards were also reversible error, as compliance is merely evidence for the jury to consider in determining negligence. Evidence the product had been modified after manufacture or misused did not absolve the manufacturer of liability, if the modification or misuse was foreseeable. Finally, the court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on implied warranty theories, and the lessor and lessee could not be liable under strict liability or warranty theories as they were the users of the product, and the employee did not lease from them, but was a bailee for repair.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court committed prejudicial error in admitting evidence gained by virtue of an illegal citizen's arrest because the arresting officer did not have probable cause to arrest him. The court ruled that when a policeman made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he could, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile. Further, the court held that defendant was validly arrested and in custody when the sheriff searched the vehicle. The court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant, concluding that the sheriff made a valid search of defendant's vehicle, and that the trial court correctly denied suppression of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The mother claimed that the park immunity statutes were unconstitutional under the &quot;open courts&quot; provision of S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child suffered chemical burns at a city pool. The park immunity statutes,&nbsp;S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 9-38-55 and S.D.  &sect; 9-38-105, extended immunity to city park operations. The circuit court found the statutes applicable. The appellate court reversed. The court recognized the concept of sovereign immunity as it applied to states. However, that immunity did not always extend to municipalities. Also, under the &quot;open doors&quot; provision, a party had a remedy where a cause of action was recognized at common law. Under the common law, immunity for cities existed only when a city was acting as an agent of the state in a governmental capacity. The operation of a pool was instead a proprietary function. Therefore, city did not have common law immunity, and the park immunity statutes were an unconstitutional attempt to extend immunity in violation of the &quot;open doors&quot; provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a number of other persons severely beat the victim. Defendant and a co-defendant were indicted and tried together. The trial court instructed the jury at the close of the evidence that each defendant was entitled to have his guilt or innocence of the crime charged determined from his own conduct and from the evidence which applied only to him as though he were being tried alone. Defendant argued that he was wrongfully denied a separate trial because the evidence against him was not as strong as that shown against his codefendant. He also argued that the imposition of the maximum sentence of 10 years was cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The conviction and sentence were affirmed. The court held that (1) the trial court's cautionary instruction, which required the jury to consider each defendant's guilt separately from the evidence, was a sufficient cautionary instruction which guarded against prejudice to an individual defendant in a joint trial, and (2) 10 years imprisonment was not so severe and so entirely out of proportion to the gravity of the offense actually committed as to shock the conscience of the court.</SPAN></P>

The court found that respondent interfered with petitioner's vested rights in receiving and using downstream waters for domestic purposes pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 46-1-9(2). The court found that due to the dams built by respondent, water did not flow as it had prior to construction of the dams and therefore the dams interfered with the downstream irrigators. The court noted that petitioner did not have enough downstream water for calving season and also lost one of his crops. The court concluded that respondent's due process rights were not violated by the Board's decision because there was no evidence in the record that anyone on the Board acted in both the prosecutorial and adjudicatory roles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners sought to exclude certain tracts from the field because they contended that they would not receive their fair share of the oil allocation and revenue. On appeal, the court affirmed in a case of first impression. The court first explained the concept of unitization and the Board's authority to enforce a compulsory unitization agreement. The Board's duty was to engage in a balancing between preventing waste and protecting correlative rights. Reaching specific issues, the court held that the Board had subject matter jurisdiction to make a unitization order. The argument that improper notice was given so as to defeat personal jurisdiction was rejected because the issue was waived by the property owners' appearances before the Board. Whether the notice statute,&nbsp;S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 45-9-58 (Michie), was unconstitutional was not raised below by most of the property owners, and the court would therefore not review it. Further, as noted, the appearances constituted a waiver. Whether the evidence did not support the use of a participation formula was rejected largely because the issue was not preserved. The Board's order was not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company appealed the trial court's judgment, arguing that S.D. Const. art.

The court held that &sect; 12 was applicable to contracts awarded on the basis of the lowest submitted bid. Section 12 prohibited State contracts with a legislator, during or within one year of his term, when the contracts were authorized during the term. S.D. Codified Laws &sect;5-23-14 took the constraint one step further and stated that contracts with legislators, valid under S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 12, could only be awarded if the legislator was the lowest responsible bidder. Construing these enactments together, a present legislator could benefit from a contract with the State if the contract was not authorized during his term and he was the lowest responsible bidder.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the Circuit Court of the Eighth Judicial Circuit, Lawrence County, South Dakota, for possession of an untaxed controlled substance in violation of S.D. Consolidated Laws &sect; 10-50A-6, and possession of a controlled substance without a license in violation of S.D. Consolidated Laws &sect; 10-50A-4. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statutes were part of S.D. Consolidated Laws ch. 10-50A, entitled &quot;Luxury Tax on Controlled Substances and Marijuana.&quot; The chapter provided for licensing and taxing of dealers in marijuana and controlled substances. The court, applying the test established by the United States Supreme Court to determine whether a regulatory or taxation scheme violated the Fifth Amendment, held that the chapter was an unconstitutional infringement upon defendant's right against self-incrimination. Through S.D. Consolidated Laws &sect; 10-50A-15, tax information acquired under the chapter could be released to law enforcement officials under S.D. Consolidated Laws &sect; 10-1-28.4. Thus, filing a return created a real risk of self-incrimination. Furthermore, the alleged purpose of the chapter was to tax and license trade in illicit controlled substances. There was no doubt that the chapter was directed toward a select group inherently suspect of criminal activities. The court declined to read the chapter in such a manner that return information would be fully confidential. The clear intent of the chapter was to provide an extra penalty on possessors of controlled substances through unconstitutional means.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate pleaded guilty to sexual contact with a child under 15 in violation of S.D.

The trial court sentenced the inmate to the maximum penalty of 25 years in the state penitentiary. The inmate subsequently filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus arguing that his guilty plea was void because S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-22-7 was unconstitutional, and he was denied effective assistance of counsel where his attorneys failed to assert the unconstitutionality of the statute. The court affirmed the denial of the inmate's petition. Specifically, the court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 22-22-7 because the inmate failed carry his burden of showing why the appraisal of the crime's gravity was unconstitutional. Furthermore, the court rejected the inmate's claim of ineffective counsel because the inmate's voluntary plea of guilty that was made in light of the then applicable law did not become vulnerable due to later judicial decisions indicating that the plea rested on a faulty premise. The inmate's counsel could not be presumed to know the future rulings of the courts.</SPAN></P>

The court held: (1) defendant was within the statutory definition of &quot;person&quot; contained in S.D.

The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction. When examining the issue of the voluntariness of a confession or admission, the trial court's finding of voluntariness would not be overturned unless it was clearly erroneous. Evidence in the record showed that when officers arrived at the scene, defendant approached them and stated, &quot;I'm the one you're looking for.&quot; He was read the Miranda warnings prior to questioning and stated that he understood and waived them. Defendant read the written statement, and before signing it, he was allowed to make an addition. The officers testified that he did not act unusual or tell them that he was in pain when questioned.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed driving erratically and he was stopped and arrested for driving while intoxicated. After he bumped his head on exiting the police car he was taken to the hospital where a blood test was performed, showing that his blood alcohol level was .20 percent. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the results of the chemical analysis of his blood. The officer testified that he had interpreted defendant's silence as a refusal of the test, but the magistrate denied the motion. Defendant was convicted and appealed, contending that S.D.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction, arguing that a wiretap used to gather evidence was illegal, the State failed to turn over witness statements in a timely manner, and that the trial court erred in permitting a judge who had been a witness to receive the jury verdict. The court rejected defendant's argument that S.D. Codified Laws ch. 23A-35A was unconstitutional. Although the state statute was silent concerning federal wiretap requirements, the court looked to determine if the State complied with federal law. The court held that the wiretap used to collect evidence against defendant complied with federal law and that probable cause existed to order the wiretap. Although the court disapproved of the State's failure to release witness statements to the defense, no reversible error resulted because defendant was able to adequately cross-examine the witnesses at trial. Further, although the judge who had served as a witness should not have taken the jury verdict, defendant failed to poll the jury, make motions, or challenge any legal matters when the verdict was received, so no reversible error existed.</SPAN></P>

Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-1.2, which required a suspect to take a breath test or be arrested, was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. First, the driver's erratic driving created probable cause for the stop. The driver's bloodshot, watery eyes, his performance on the roadside sobriety tests, his demeanor, and the odor of alcohol all gave the officer probable cause for an arrest. That the blood test, administered hours after the arrest, failed to show alcohol was not dispositive. The driver had no standing to attack the constitutionality of the breath test statute, because he refused to submit to it; nor could he challenge the validity of the statute that allowed a person who pled guilty to keep his driver's license, because he had pled not guilty.</SPAN></P>

After defendant paid $ 46,408 to the South Dakota Department of Revenue, a magistrate vacated the conviction and ordered the Department to return the money paid. The Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit, Minnehaha County (South Dakota), reversed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court found that defendant made no payments under protest of illegality, that defendant continued to violate the state constitution with his gambling venture, and that, accordingly, defendant had waived his right to protest the voluntary plea agreement. The court affirmed on a different rationale. The money defendant paid to the Department was either taxes, penalty, and interest, or it was paid as a fine. If paid as a fine, it far exceeded magistrate court jurisdiction. The court concluded then that the sentence clearly denominated the money as taxes, penalty, and interest. At no time were the sums considered fines or costs, which arguably could have been returned to defendant. Though S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-31-1 retained jurisdiction for the magistrate court to correct an illegal sentence, it did not authorize refund of the monies paid pursuant to defendant's plea agreement. In S.D.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By petition, the applicant commenced an original action seeking a declaratory judgment that S.B. 310, 60th Sess. (S.D.1985) was unconstitutional and a writ of prohibition to prevent the Governor of South Dakota and the Commissioner of School and Public Lands from combining assets of a certain trust with the normal schools of South Dakota lands permanent fund and interest and income fund as authorized in S.B. 310.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the legislature decided to close a state university branch and transfer it to the Board of Charities and Corrections for use as a minimum security prison, the applicant sought to prevent transfer of university trust funds. On appeal, the court rejected applicant's argument that &sect; 1 of S.B. 310 violated the court's decision in an earlier case, the Enabling Act, 25 Stat. 676, ch. 180, which created a permanent fund and an interest and income fund, and S.D. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7. None of those authorities mandated that the trust land, or so much as remained unsold, and all other assets designated as part of the university's trust had to be used for trust purposes in perpetuity. The Enabling Act stated that the object of the permanent trust fund was educational and charitable, as the legislatures might determine. The designation in art. VIII, &sect; 7 of &quot;a perpetual fund inviolably appropriated to the specific objects of the original grant&quot; was not offended by S.B. 310. There was no merit to the applicant's argument that S.B. 310 violated the language of the earlier decision, nor did that decision render S.B. 310 unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the alternative writ of prohibition previously issued and denied applicant's petition for a peremptory writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>
