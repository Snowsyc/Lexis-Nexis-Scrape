</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating the Ohio animal fights statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 959.15. She sought review of the conviction, arguing that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court upheld the conviction. The court ruled that although one portion of the statute was overly vague and broad, that portion was severable for the remainder. The court also held that defendant did not demonstrate that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to her. The court noted that &sect; 959.15 prohibited a person from knowingly engaging in cockfighting, bearbaiting, or pitting an animal against another. The statute also provided that any person who knowing purchased a ticket of admission to a place where animal fights were held or was &quot;present thereat&quot; or witnessed such a spectacle was an aider or abettor. The court found that the phrase &quot;present thereat&quot; was unconstitutionally vague because it could have been applied to a person who was at a place where animal fights were held when there was no fight in progress. Thus, the phrase potentially infringed a party's First Amendment right of free assembly. Therefore, the court said, the phrase was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of no contest to charges contained in two indictments. The trial court convicted and sentenced defendant on several charges of trafficking in drugs and of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in finding him guilty of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity because the State could not have proven every element of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and concluded that the state's RICO statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the failure to set forth a scienter requirement in the RICO statute did not render it void for vagueness. The court found that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.21(B) recklessness was sufficient culpability to commit a violation of the RICO statute. The court determined that because defendant did not object that the contents of the indictment were fatally defective, he waived his right to raise objections to the indictment on appeal. The court found that because the drug trafficking offenses and the RICO offense were of dissimilar import, the trial court had not erred in convicting him of both.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant engaged in a number of transactions with her clients, in which she accepted money to be invested as appellant saw fit.

Code &sect;&sect; 1707.44(A) and 1707.44(C)(1), which require a license to sell securities and require that securities be registered. The court determined that although it was error for the court to admit evidence establishing that appellant's clients lost money in the transactions, no prejudice resulted. Appellant's contention that the terms &quot;security&quot; and &quot;sale&quot;, as defined in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 1707.01, were void for vagueness was rejected by the court, because appellant was unable to overcome the presumption of constitutionality that attaches to statutes designed to promote the public health, safety, and welfare.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested as the result of a food stamp trafficking investigation by the Ohio Department of Agriculture. Defendant illegally purchased food stamps from an investigator and a search warrant was later executed at defendant's residence. Illegal food stamps, cocaine, and other contraband were found during the search. On appeal, defendant argued in part that he was deprived of the constitutional right to the effective aid of counsel and that his drug conviction was not sustained by the evidence and constituted plain error. He also claimed that his convictions for food stamp trafficking were void because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.46(A) was unconstitutional. The court found that defendant received effective assistance at trial. The court also found substantial evidence upon which it reasonably could have been concluded that all the elements of the offenses were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, the court construed &sect; 2913.46(A) as only encompassing federal statutory amendments that existed when the state statute was enacted, and it concluded that the statute had not unconstitutionally abdicated state legislative power to the federal government as defendant implied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident was charged a minimum charge for garbage collection pursuant to a city ordinance. He objected to the charge, asserting that he did not generate garbage requiring collection. After failing to pay his bill, he was notified of a potential termination of service. He requested a hearing, which was granted pursuant to a city ordinance. The hearing officer found that the city was entitled to collect the minimum charge and that the resident was responsible for paying it. His failure to do so subjected him to a termination of service. On appeal, the resident contended that the city ordinances were unconstitutional, and subject to strict scrutiny, in that he did not use the city's services and that there was an unconstitutional application of the disconnect law to him. The court held that the city ordinances were not subject to strict scrutiny because the right to municipal water and garbage service was not a constitutional right. Applying the rational basis test, the disconnection of the service was rationally related to a government purpose. The utility billing procedures were administered identically among residents and the charges were reasonable and lawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village applied for a certain levy of mills of the unvoted millage, which the Commission denied. The village appealed and the Board affirmed the Commission's decision. The village sought a review. In reversing and remanding the Board's decision, the court held that the Board erred in holding that appellee's minimum levies took precedence over the village's debt service levy as Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5705(D) provided that debt charges should have been given priority. However, the court noted that &sect; 5705.31(D) did not require the Commission to lower the minimum levies of other subdivisions to satisfy the village's debt. The court noted that the village was entitled to six mils and therefore the Board would have millage left to pay to appellee. The court determined that the Board abused its discretion in affirming the Commission's award because there was conflicting evidence regarding whether appellees provided services to the village. Therefore, the court concluded that there was no support for the Commission's conclusion that the levy for debt charges was properly authorized. The court ordered the Commission to equalize the millage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 16-year old employee, who lost his hand in a punch press accident after he slipped on oil, alleged that the employer failed to verify the employee's age, even though the employee intentionally misrepresented his age, failed to give him more than five minutes of training on a dangerous machine, and was responsible for a supervisor advising the employee that the did not have to wear his safety device. The employee admitted, however, to being warned on numerous occasions to wear the safety device and that he recognized the danger of the machines. The trial court granted summary judgment for the employer. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that an Ohio Supreme Court decision declaring Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80&nbsp;unconstitutional would apply retroactively to benefit the employee because the common law imposed a less stringent standard on employees seeking to prove intentional torts against their employers. However, the employer did not have knowledge that harm was substantially certain to befall the employee and &quot;intent&quot; could not be found on the facts, even though the employer's acts could be characterized as reckless or negligent. Thus, summary judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the trial court did not err. The court found that the State complied with discovery requests and where the State failed to furnish oral statements beforehand, defendant did not show she was prejudiced. The court determined that expert testimony on the battered woman syndrome was properly excluded because it was not offered as a defense nor was self-defense, a related defense, offered. The court concluded defendant's constitutional rights to due process were not violated when the trial court allegedly constructively amended the indictment to include aiding and abetting. The court found that defendant and her son were found guilty of murder and therefore she was on notice, without any specific writing, that aiding and abetting were part of the charge. The court also found that the jury was polled when all jurors raised their hands indicating agreement with the verdict. The court concluded that there was substantial evidence of defendant's confession, on more than one occasion, that she committed the murder.</SPAN></P>

Both defendant and co-defendant, his mother, were prosecuted in connection with the shooting death of defendant's father, who was believed by defendant to be abusing his mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Hearing a woman's cries, defendant went into the kitchen to find his father choking his mother. He grabbed a gun, shot the older man from behind, and then shot him again when the older man turned around. Both defendant and his mother were convicted of murder. Defendant appealed but the court affirmed his conviction. The court first rejected claims that the jury was improperly polled, that the bailiff had improper contact with the jury, or that various instructions relating to the issue of aiding and abetting were improper. The court also found no merit in claims that the trial court's failure to give a complete self-defense instruction required reversal. The trial court's failure to instruct the jury on a defendant's right not to retreat in his own home was harmless because the jury's verdict showed that it rejected self-defense and because there was no showing that retreat was possible in any event. Moreover, the trial court properly refused testimony on the battered woman syndrome because the mother did not claim self-defense. Finally, no error was found in connection with the admission of rebuttal testimony relating to defendant's alleged misconduct and suspensions from school.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was pulled over by the officer after he pulled his vehicle out in front of the officer nearly causing an accident. Defendant submitted to a breath alcohol content test. At the hearing on the motion to suppress and dismiss, defendant argued that there was no probable cause to stop his vehicle on said morning and that he was denied constitutional rights by not being notified that he could petition to have occupational driving privileges. The court on appeal affirmed. Contrary to defendant's claim that probable cause must exist before a valid and constitutional stop of an automobile could be made, the United States Supreme Court had stated that there had to exist only a reasonable suspicion for a police officer to stop an automobile. In determining whether a stop of an automobile was proper, the reviewing court had to view the stop in light of the totality of the surrounding circumstances. A review of the officer's testimony indicated that he had reasonable suspicions sufficient to warrant stopping defendant's vehicle. Defendant failed to yield to the officer's car and then he drove only ten miles per hour in a forty-five mile per hour zone; hence, the stop was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1985, the employee was operating a backhoe, which was partially situated on railroad tracks. The employee requested that the employer provide a watchman, but the employer refused. The employee suffered back injuries when he suddenly exited the backhoe to avoid being hit by an oncoming train. The employee filed a complaint alleging that the employer had left the employee alone without a watchman, knowing that that created a situation where it was substantially certain that the employee would be injured. At the time of the accident, the two-year statute of limitations set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.10 was in effect. In 1986, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 became effective, which provided a one-year limitations period. The employee filed his complaint in September 1987. The employer filed an answer, which asserted the statute of limitation set forth &sect; 4121.80. The employer filed a motion to dismiss, which the trial court granted. The court sustained the employee's assignment of error. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 was unconstitutional. The two-year statute of limitations codified in Ohio Rev.

The trial court granted summary judgment to the examinee in his action to declare the Commission's action unconstitutional and the test void, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that the Commission, in promulgating a rule which set forth procedures for objecting to promotional examinations in the police department, exceeded its authority under the city charter because Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee minor patient and mother brought a medical malpractice action against appellant hospital alleging that appellee minor patient's hearing loss was attributable to the negligence of appellant. The court reversed the judgment against appellant pertaining to the award of compensatory damages and prejudgment interest. The judgment was affirmed insofar as it held appellant liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior for the negligence of its nursing staff. The court found that a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the intravenous line causing the injury had not properly been clamped. The court found independent testimony, properly admitted for its truth, to show specifically that the overdose resulted from nursing error and that a nurse had forgotten to shut off the clamp. The court found no other indication that appellant acted unreasonably or without good faith, and, therefore, prejudgment interest was unwarranted. The court found on appellees' cross -appeal, that the cap on damages under Ohio Rev. Code Ann &sect; 2307.43 substantially impaired the right to trial by jury and that the statute violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 5 and, therefore, remanded the matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city employee filed an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress against the city based on emotional and physical injuries that he alleged occurred when he was ordered by his superiors to engage in criminal activity at a city-operated cemetery. The city claimed that because the employee's injuries were sustained in the course of his employment, it was entitled to immunity pursuant to the Ohio Workers' Compensation Act as well as the immunity that was provided by Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 35, Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4123.74, and Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4123.741. The city's motion for summary judgment was granted by the trial court. On review the court held that summary judgment had been improvidently granted because immunity under the statute was available only if the employer did not act intentionally, and there existed a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the city knew or should have known of the criminal conduct that its supervisory employees allegedly required the employee to engage in. The court held that there was also a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the city was negligent in the operation of the cemetery.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that his motion to suppress testimony by the arresting police officers was improperly overruled because the officers, while on duty for the exclusive purpose of enforcing traffic laws, used an unmarked car or were not wearing distinctive uniforms as required by law. On appeal, the court held that defendant failed to prove that the officers were on duty for the exclusive purpose of enforcing traffic laws. The court found that the officers, while on patrol, were looking for any violations, such as littering or disturbances, and not just traffic violations. Defendant's arrest occurred shortly after the officers' shift ended. The court stated that the officers did not, however, come back on duty at the time of the arrest for the sole purpose of enforcing traffic laws, finding that the officers technically remained on duty until the reached their homes. The court determined, however, that the trial court erred in imposing its sentence when neither defendant nor his counsel were present, thereby depriving defendant of his opportunity to pose a valid objection to his sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The trial court apparently relied on Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.12(D) to deny the father's request for a jury trial even though he complied with Ohio R. Civ. P. 38(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father made a jury demand in his timely answer to the mother's complaint. After about two and one half years of blood testing and pretrial procedures, the father made a deposit for jury costs, but about eight months later the trial was scheduled and the father did not renew his demand. When he realized that trial would proceed without a jury, he filed an objection but the trial court overruled the objection and the father appealed. The court reversed the trial court and remanded the matter. The court held that although the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure gave the father the right to request a jury trial up to 14 days after the last pleading, the 3-day restriction imposed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.12(D) did not conflict with the civil rules in such a way as to invalidate the 3-day restriction. The court, however, explained that the word &quot;within&quot; from Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow and the decedent had two minor children at the time of the decedent's death. The widow and the minor children were entitled to death benefits from the fund pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 742.61. The trial court found that the distribution scheme that gave the dependent children their own share of the total benefits did not violate the principles of equal protection. However, the trial court found that the second portion of the statutory scheme violated the equal protection clause. At the time when both of her children were emancipated, the widow received less than other surviving spouses similarly situated, that is, without any minor children dependent upon them. The trial court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 742.63 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed and held that defendants offered no rational explanation why the total benefits paid to a deceased fireman or policeman's dependents should decrease over time, rather than remaining the same.</SPAN></P>

A jury found defendant not guilty of theft and theft in office, and guilty of unauthorized access to a computer. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 2913.04(B) was not unconstitutionally vague as it clearly and reasonably apprised persons of ordinary intelligence that it was unlawful to store data in, or use a computer, when one was without or beyond the express or implied consent of the owner, or without a reasonable, though mistaken belief that one had proper authorization. The fact that committees of the state bar association deemed &sect; 2913.04 to be a statute that people might unknowingly violate was insufficient to render it unconstitutionally vague. Defendant's conduct clearly and unambiguously fell within the prohibitions of &sect; 2913.04, thus defendant did not possess proper standing to raise a vagueness challenge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claiming that the hospital's treatment resuscitation of her newborn child resulted in mental and physical disabilities and impairments, the mother sued the hospital for medical malpractice. After the trial court awarded damages and prejudgment interest to the mother and denied the hospital's motion for a directed verdict, the hospital appealed. Affirming, the court said that the trial court correctly denied the hospital's motion. A failure to plan resulted in confusion in the operating room. No plan existed. The departments of anesthesiology and obstetrics each believed that the other was responsible for the newborn's resuscitation. There was testimony that this breached the standard of care in the medical community. There was sufficient evidence before the trial court on which to deny the motion for a directed verdict. There was no error in instructing the jury to consider the loss of future enjoyment of life to the child or in not reducing the sum awarded by the jury for that injury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed from a summary judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Coshocton County, Ohio, which was entered in favor of defendant employer in the employee's action against the employer and others for injuries arising out of a work-related accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's action against his employer, alleged that the employer intentionally caused the employee's injury by removing the safety guard from a machine before instructing the employee to clean it. The employee also brought a malpractice action against his former law firm and two attorneys, alleging that the law firm advised him that the statute of limitations for his claim was two years, while it was one year under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the employer, holding that the statute of limitations was one year. After the trial court decided the employee's case, the Ohio Supreme Court declared that &sect; 4121.80 was unconstitutional in toto. On appeal the court reversed, holding that the one-year statute of limitations was unworthy of enforcement because the Ohio Supreme Court's holding that the statute upon which the summary judgment was based was unconstitutional in toto rendered that statute void and the court was required to apply the law as it existed at the time the appeal was heard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's summary judgment and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings in accord with the applicable law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the parties agreement and the divorce decree, the husband was obligated to pay the wife permanent alimony until the death of either party, the wife's remarriage, or her cohabitation.

Nevertheless, the husband moved for modification and claimed that the payments were blatantly unfair and contrary to public policy, which resulted in his hardship. The trial court determined that it had no jurisdiction to modify the decree. On appeal, the court affirmed, noting that public policy under Ohio Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another man were observed by police officers in a high crime area and as the police stopped to talk to the men, they fled into an apartment building, where the police followed. After the police found the men, they ordered them to their knees and saw a film canister by defendant's hand. The canister contained crack cocaine. Defendant was convicted of aggravated drug trafficking and the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found that the lower court did not err in denying the motion to suppress the drugs because the cocaine was not found on defendant, but in the stairwell, and therefore it was not illegally seized. The court determined that as the state only had to prove either the weight or dosage of the drugs under Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2925.01(E)(1), and the state chose to prove bulk amount using the dosage description, it was not erroneous for the lower court to instruct the jury only on dosage. The court concluded that although there were some inconsistencies in the testimony of the two officers, their testimony was the same on the basic facts and therefore the conviction was not against the weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor was convicted of forgery, theft, and Medicaid fraud following a bench trial. She was denied a license to practice medicine and surgery by the Board, and the trial court affirmed the Board's decision. On appeal, she claimed that Ohio Rev.

The doctor contended that this procedure deprived her of having a hearing before a neutral detached factfinder. The court did not find any indication that any undue influence was exerted by the Attorney General through one of his assistants with respect to the Board action. The court found no constitutional infirmity in &sect; 4731.23(A) and analogized the situation to that of a trial judge appointing a referee under Ohio R. Civ.

The veterinarian sought judicial review. The trial court affirmed the suspension, but dismissed the charges of improper administration of drugs and gross incompetence. The veterinarian sought review and the court affirmed. The court noted that the trial court's review was limited to whether the Board's findings were supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in upholding the Board's findings because record clearly demonstrated that the trial court's judgment was supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's motion for post-conviction relief on the ground of res judicata.

The court noted that defendant bore the burden of submitting evidentiary documents containing sufficient operative facts to demonstrate the lack of competent counsel and that the defense was prejudiced by counsel's ineffectiveness. The court further noted that only those claims based on evidence which could not reasonably have been presented in the original proceeding were not barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The court found that defense counsel properly refused to file a motion to suppress because the officers' search of defendant's home was incident to a lawful arrest based on probable cause. The court determined that defendant failed to overcome the presumption that defense counsel was competent and that the acts complained of were part of defense counsel's strategy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the Tax Commissioner of Ohio, made various assessments against a corporation for sales tax allegedly unpaid by the corporation. Appellant corporate president sought review of an order of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, which found him to be a responsible officer of his corporation within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.03 and levying an assessment against him for the allegedly unpaid sales tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A settlement was reached between a corporation and the state, acting through special counsel appointed by the state attorney general, with respect to unpaid state sales taxes. As a result of that settlement, evidenced by a letter of the special counsel, the corporation's counsel made payment by check payable to the special counsel, as the state's attorney. The check contained a notation by the corporation's counsel reflecting that it was for payment of all sales tax obligations up to February 1, 1985. Later, the Tax Commissioner made new sales tax assessments for certain periods preceding the settlement's date. On an appeal from the Board's order holding the president personally liable for the assessments, the court held that the Board's finding that the president was an officer responsible for the tax was not unreasonable or unlawful and that the statute of limitations did not bar the assessments. However, the court reversed and remanded, finding no merit in the Tax commissioner's claim that the special counsel lacked authority to enter into the settlement and holding that the Board's decision that no accord and satisfaction was accomplished was both unreasonable and unlawful.</SPAN></P>

A dependency complaint was filed and custody of the children was given to the father. The children were removed from their father's home and a new dependency complaint was filed. By agreement of the parties, the children were placed in the temporary custody of children's services. A comprehensive reunification plan was filed. However, the parents made little effort to comply with the plan. Counselors and caseworkers recommended that children's services move for permanent custody. The trial court found, after an adjudicatory hearing, that the children could not be placed with either of their parents within a reasonable time. At a dispositional hearing, the trial court found by clear and convincing evidence that it was in the best interest of the children that they be committed to the permanent care and custody of children's services and that the parents be divested of all parental rights. In affirming, the court noted that children's services met its burden of showing that it made reasonable efforts to return the children to the home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client initiated a legal malpractice case against the attorneys who represented him in a federal case. The trial court granted the attorneys' motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint because the cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(A). The client appealed and argued that the statute of limitations was tolled under the &quot;savings&quot; statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.15(A), after one attorney moved to the Virgin Islands. The court determined that &sect; 2305.15(A) was unconstitutional because it violated the Commerce Clause and denied out-of-state parties of the benefits of the limitations period unless special action was taken to preserve the benefits of the statute of limitations. The client failed to demonstrate that the methods of service available to him were inadequate to subject the out-of-state attorney to jurisdiction during the one-year limitation period provided by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(A). The burden on interstate commerce created by the tolling provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.15(A) exceeded the local interests of the State in withholding the limitations benefit to the out-of-state attorney.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student alleged that the employees and the board negligently, wilfully, and wantonly caused her injuries and that, under color of state law, they maliciously violated her rights under U.S. Const. amends. I, V, XIV by retaliating against her and her parents for statements they made critical of the cheerleading program. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that no genuine issue of material fact existed concerning whether the employees forced the student to engage in the cheerleading exercise. The testimony of the mother and the student as to their own negligence diminished their testimony that the employees forced the student to engage in the exercise. The court found no evidence in the depositions to prove the employees acted other than in the course and scope of their employment. The student failed to present evidence of a motivating factor linking her exercise of her First Amendment rights with the employees' alleged retaliatory actions. The court found insufficient evidence to demonstrate the child's right to an enjoyable cheerleading experience was a fundamental liberty or property right subject to due process protection under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Voters residing within a school district approved a bond issue, which was to be repaid by a tax levy. The taxpayers brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the bond issue and tax levy were invalid, and a permanent injunction to prevent their implementation. The taxpayers claimed that the bond issue caused the school district's net indebtedness to exceed four percent of the tax valuation thereof. The taxpayers further alleged that, under such circumstances, the board of education was required to procure supervisory permission before submitting the bond issue to the voters. During the course of the litigation, the Ohio General Assembly passed legislation curing the procedural defect with the bonds and levy. The public entities therefore filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. The taxpayers appealed, but the court affirmed. The court held that the curative legislation was constitutional, because it was a suitable exercise of the General Assembly's plenary power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in finding him guilty of two counts of drug abuse because he contended it was an affirmative defense that he possessed the controlled substances for his own personal use. The court disagreed, holding that since defendant was not charged with possessing a bulk amount of a controlled substance in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2295.03(A)(5) or cultivating marijuana in violation of &sect; 2925.03(A)(3), he was not entitled to assert the affirmative defense of &quot;personal use.&quot; Defendant further claimed that he was denied his constitutional right to the equal protection of the law when he was not permitted to assert the affirmative defense of &quot;personal use&quot; for the offense of drug abuse. The court found that if the &quot;personal use&quot; defense were made applicable to those charged with drug abuse, the defense would operate as a complete defense and would thereby legalize the abuse of drugs such as cocaine and heroin. The legislature rejected such a course of action. Since there was a rational basis for the legislature's application of the personal usage defense, defendant's constitutional rights were not violated. The court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers subsequently exercised the options and reported the amount received to the federal government. However, the taxpayers did not report the amount realized from the exercise of the stock options when they filed their city tax return. The city's taxing authority determined that the amount should have been included and issued an assessment against the taxpayers. The court reversed the trial court's judgment affirming the decision of the city. The court held that no transcript of the hearing before the city taxing authority was filed with the trial court in compliance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.02, and thus the trial court was unable to review the transcript to determine whether the presentation of additional evidence was necessary. Therefore, it was clear that the trial court tried the case de novo instead of referring to the applicable standard of review and properly reviewing the decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A claimant filed an action against the county in federal court. Before the filing of the federal lawsuit, an insurance company had been rendered insolvent. In accordance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3955.08(A)(1), the county demanded coverage from OIGA upon the defunct policies. The county initiated an action seeking a declaration of coverage upon the policies. In a foreign jurisdiction, a court appointed a liquidator and demanded that all claims against the insurance company be submitted by a date certain. The county was unaware of the claimant's claim as of that date and submitted its claim to OIGA several months late. The trial judge found that because the county was unaware of the claim against it, it had not been notified by the liquidator of the deadline for filing claims against the insurance company, so OIGA was therefore estopped from denying coverage. On appeal the court reversed, holding that &sect; 3955.08(A)(1) set forth a flat declaration that OIGA would not be liable for late claims, which was neither optional nor conditional. The court held that the trial court erred by ordering OIGA to provide coverage upon the policy, since the county's claim was not timely filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In denying the prisoner's request, the committee considered charges against the prisoner of which he had been acquitted. The prisoner failed to specifically designate any alleged errors, but argued in effect that he was denied due process because the committee improperly considered evidence of other crimes of which he was acquitted. The prisoner argued that to deny him the opportunity to be considered for parole prior to the expiration of the five-year continuance period, on the basis of crimes for which he was acquitted and/or convicted of lesser included offenses, denied him due process of law. The court held that the committee could have considered the indictment's unproven allegations to determine the nature of the prisoner's criminal conduct and the offense which he committed. The fact that he shot and wounded a policeman as opposed to killed him was relevant to the committee's recommendation. Because the prisoner had no right to parole and accordingly no liberty interest upon which a due process right may have attached, the court was convinced Ohio Admin.

The trainer was found guilty of conduct against the best interests of racing and fraudulent or improper practice. On appeal, the trainer argued, inter alia, that due process requirements were not satisfied in the proceedings of the Commission, that the Commission did not comply with the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12 to timely file a complete record of its proceedings in the trial court, and that the Commission exceeded its authority by imposing a suspension and revocation of his license for over a year. The court found that the trainer received all the process due him because he was afforded a formal adjudicatory post-suspension hearing after a board of stewards of a racing meeting initially suspended him. The board was not required to hold a hearing before suspending a license. The trainer had not demonstrated prejudice from the failure of the Commission to timely file the record. The four year suspension was within the legal authority of the Commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guardian contended that the physicians and health care providers failed to diagnose and treat the ward's subdural hematoma, which negligence caused the ward permanent and serious injuries. A mandatory arbitration, where the physicians testified but the guardian was precluded from offering any live witness testimony, produced a report that went before the jury at the trial of the cause. Although two physicians were found to have been negligent, the jury assessed no damages. On the guardian's appeal, the court found that: (1) to permit the physicians to testify on arbitration but to deny the guardian the opportunity to call live witnesses was a due process violation; (2) it was prejudicial error for the trial court to admit the report that the unfair arbitration proceeding produced; (3) the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on the successive tortfeasor rule because the guardian did not request the charge; (4) administration of an intervening/supervening cause instruction was proper as to the nurses but harmless error as to the physicians; and (5) the trial court rightly refused the guardian's requested but flawed instruction on the alternate liability rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Summit County (Ohio), which affirmed a decision of appellee State Employment Relations Board (SERB) that the city had committed an unfair labor practice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and a union representing its police reached an impasse in negotiations for a new contract. They had agreed to be bound by a statute, which required binding arbitration. The union requested binding arbitration. However, only days before the union's request the Supreme Court of Ohio had declared the binding arbitration provisions of the statute unconstitutional. The city refused to engage in binding arbitration and the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with SERB. Six months after its first decision, the Supreme Court vacated the decision and reinstated the statute. The city then agreed to arbitration and a settlement was reached. SERB, however, found that the city had committed an unfair labor practice because it had agreed to binding arbitration. The court held that the city had no authority to agree to unconstitutional provisions of the statute. For the six months that the statute was unconstitutional, the city was justified in refusing binding arbitration and therefore did not commit an unfair labor practice.</SPAN></P>

The trial court reversed the BZA on the grounds that the weight of the evidence supported a finding that mulching was an &quot;agricultural service&quot; within the definition of Miami Township, Ohio, Zoning Ordinance &sect; 803(K).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner conducted a mulching operation on his land, which was located in an agricultural district. Mulching was not expressly included anywhere in art. 8 of the zoning ordinance as an authorized principal, accessory, or conditional use. The owner was informed by an inspector that his mulching operation was in violation of the zoning ordinance. He filed an application with the BZA, seeking administrative review. He also filed a conditional use application with the BZA. The BZA affirmed the inspector's decision and unanimously denied the conditional use application. The owner appealed both decisions and the trial court reversed, finding that the BZA's denial of the conditional use application was unreasonable and contrary to the preponderance of the evidence. The administrator sought further review, arguing that the trial court erred in reversing the BZA's decision because it was reasonable and supported by the evidence. The appellate court agreed and reversed the trial court's order. The court concluded that a preponderance of the evidence before the BZA supported its determination that the owner's mulching operation did not primarily serve the farming community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a patient and spouse, filed a malpractice action against defendants, a doctor and clinic, for negligence and loss of consortium. A jury verdict ruled in favor of plaintiffs and awarded plaintiff patient $ 8 million and plaintiff spouse $ 1. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court's judgment. The court found that the trial court was not required to hold a hearing before determining that the arbitration award was admissible. The court found that defendants were not prejudiced by the trial court's grant of oral, rather than written, permission to the media to broadcast the proceedings pursuant to Ohio Sup. R. 11(A). The court found that defendants did not present evidence to show that any juror was prejudiced or biased by the publicity. The court found that the expert's testimony regarding what a &quot;reasonable person&quot; would have done was determinative of an ultimate issue in the case, but that the expert's experience in evaluating a patient's response to the disclosed risks could have assisted the jury. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2305.27 did not require the award to be reduced by the amount of the Social Security disability payments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Washington County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of the offense of arson, as proscribed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.03(A)(4). Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.02(A)(3), the denial of defendant's motion to submit only the aggravated arson count or only the arson count, and the denial of defendant's request for a charge of attempted arson.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was present and observed while another man set fire to defendant's bowling alley. Defendant later reported the fire to the fire department, and he never filed an insurance claim. The court held that the acquittal of the Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2902.02(A)(3) offense rendered moot the issue of the statute's constitutionality. The submission of the arson offense to the jury was not erroneous because the offense of aggravated arson and the offense of arson were separate offenses under the circumstances and there was sufficient evidence upon the arson offense to convict. Arson was not a lesser-included offense of aggravated arson because the aggravated arson offense as charged could have been committed without commission of the arson offense. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.03(A)(4) required proof of a lack of consent or intent to defraud, which elements were not required under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.02(A)(3). The offense of arson was complete at the time of burning because there was evidence adduced of the other elements of the offense, and defendant's subsequent conduct could not negate the completed offense. Thus, a charge on attempted arson would have been improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an amended bill of particulars, the State alleged that defendant, a school teacher and coach, engaged in sexual conduct with a 16-year-old student in a storage shed located on an athletic field on school grounds. The State indicated that defendant was charged with a violation of &sect; 2907.03(A)(5) because he was a person in loco parentis to the student by virtue of his position. Affirming the trial court's dismissal of the charge, the court held that the in loco parentis doctrine was recognized in Ohio to apply in situations where an adult has assumed or has been delegated the responsibilities and obligations of a parent towards a child. School officials could assume those obligations and responsibilities under certain circumstances, such as a school field trip, but there was nothing in the record to indicate that defendant had assumed such a role towards the student.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4731-11-05(A). The physician's appeal to a Mahoning County trial court was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">From 1982 to 1989, the physician prescribed anabolic steroids and androgens to his patients for body building. There was no showing that any of his patients suffered adverse side affects as a result of the steroid use. In 1988, the Board adopted Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4731-11-05, prohibiting the use of steroids to enhance athletic ability. The Board claimed that it published a press release in the physician's hometown newspaper and to the county medical society indicating its adoption of the rule. In 1988, the physician wrote the Board for information about any rule restricting steroid prescriptions for body building, but the Board did not reply. In 1989, the Board successfully initiated proceedings to revoke his license. On appeal, the physician argued in part that the Board failed to provide notice as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.03(E). The court found that the evidence clearly indicated that the Board had not published notice of the rule's adoption prior to its effective date. The Board failed to comply with &sect; 119.03(E) and its determination that the physician had violated the rule was not supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

The Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted the City's motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner bought a satellite dish from the company and, in accord with a City ordinance, the company applied for a permit to install it. The City approved the application, subject to the owner's planting of trees around the property. The council referred the application to committee, but the application was never acted upon. One month later, the council declared a moratorium on the issuance of permits for the installation of satellite stations and other similar structures and, a month after that, it approved two applications for permits. Plaintiffs' application was never acted upon. Plaintiffs alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutional on its face or as applied to their application. On appeal, the court ruled that there were issues of material fact as to whether the City violated plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment rights of equal protection, whether the council's referral of plaintiffs' application to a committee, which was composed of the same members of the council, and the subsequent inaction by both the council and the committee, were done in good faith and were reasonable, and not arbitrary and capricious, and whether such action caused injury to plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the husband appeared to be reaching for a weapon, so he shot the husband in the head and drove off. Defendant later told the police that he &quot;did it,&quot; and that he &quot;shot him.&quot; Defendant appealed from his subsequent conviction for manslaughter and raised numerous claims of error including that his conviction was contrary to law and that his sentence was improper. He also argued that the trial court erred in failing to grant him a mistrial based on the jury's improper consideration of the issue of punishment and in failing to grant his motion to suppress evidence of statements he made at the police station without a lawyer. The court found that the trial court had not committed any reversible error. The court also found that defendant's statements were made before he was in custody and, thus, were admissible.</SPAN></P>

VI, XIV and the Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 10, 16. He also argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss for prosecutorial vindictiveness in violation of his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. Specifically, he alleged that the prosecutor was being vindictive when he issued a second indictment to the grand jury adding a firearm specification to a conspiracy count. In affirming judgment, the court found that none of the alleged incidents asserted by defendant amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel either individually or collectively.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed the victim at gunpoint, kidnapped him, and shot and killed him. His accomplice testified that defendant claimed he shot the victim to prevent identification and for punishment as the victim had little money. A bifurcated jury trial was conducted. The court held that: (1) there was no harmful error requiring reversal of the convictions; (2) the trial court failed to enumerate all mitigating factors in a report as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.03(F); (3) the trial court erred in failing to merge duplicative aggravating circumstances, as murder for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for another offense, &sect; 2929.04(A)(3), will almost always be duplicative of murder in the course of an underlying felony, &sect; 929.04(A)(7); (4) on remand, the death penalty could be reimposed as the trial court, not the jury, would render the decision; and (5) the sentence of three consecutive three-year terms of actual incarceration for gun specifications on aggravated robbery, kidnapping, and abduction was improper, as the crimes were part of a single transaction and only one three-year term could be imposed under Ohio Rev.

The court found that there was no support for a construction which allowed an employee to collect extra monetary compensation once the time for taking the compensatory time off had lapsed. The court refused to consider the City's cross-assignment of error because it was not presented until after all the employees' briefs were received and oral argument was conducted.

The court found that to the extent that a mental state could be required, the clerk was at least reckless in assisting the nuisance to be conducted and that the proposed expert's testimony regarding legislative intent was not as pertinent as the actual wording of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the judgment that was entered in favor of appellee administrator in a wrongful death action, appellant doctor sought review, contending that the special interrogatories outlining appellant's specific acts of negligence were inconsistent and irreconcilable with the general verdict. Appellant also argued that the trial court erred by precluding evidence of a settlement agreement, that a diary should not have been entered into evidence, that recovery by adult siblings was precluded, and that it was error to have denied appellant's request for a new trial or remittitur. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the decision of the trial court to exclude the settlement agreement was not unreasonable because the decedent was not present to express her own thoughts, the diary was not cumulative or prejudicial, and that it was proper for the trial court to have permitted the testimony of the decedent's brother and sister. The court further found that the award by the jury was so large that it appeared to have been based on sympathy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State in its petition alleged that, with regard to a vehicle in defendant's possession, the &quot;confidential vehicle identification number (VIN)&quot; did not match the &quot;public VIN&quot;, and the engine VIN and the transmission VIN had been ground and were no longer visible. The petition stated that the truck was possessed by defendant in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4549.62, was therefore contraband, and was subject to seizure and forfeiture. Defendant alleged that he was a bona fide purchaser for value and that he had a certificate of title for the truck. The court sustained the State's three assignments of error finding that: (1) &sect; 4549.62 was not violative of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against unusual punishment and excessive fines; (2) there was no deprivation of due process and noncompliance with the applicable State statutes; and (3) &sect; 4549.62 et seq., was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

The wife stated at trial that she attempted to consummate the marriage, but that she and her husband were unable to do so due to the husband's prostrate cancer. The trial court granted the annulment.

Code Ann. &sect; 3105.31(F) in the absence of a finding that the wife was at fault. The court held that the trial court erred and reversed the judgment. The court found that in order for a court to grant an annulment due to lack of consummation, the action had to be brought by the party aggrieved, here the wife. Because the wife tried to consummate the marriage, but was unable to due to the husband's condition, the husband could not annul the marriage based upon the failure to consummate.</SPAN></P>

After defendant had served three and one-half years of his original sentence, the trial court resentenced defendant. As opposed to the original 10 to 25 year concurrent sentences, the trial court sentenced defendant to 2 consecutive sentences of 5 to 25 years.

Defendant was arrested on an outstanding warrant. In addition, three stolen coats were found in his possession. Upon being indicted for grand theft, defendant moved the trial court to suppress the introduction of the coats into evidence. The trial court denied the motion. The court found that defendant was stopped based upon information given in a police bulletin. The basis of the bulletin was information reported by the owner of the service station and the attendant. The information supplied by them, as citizen-informants, was presumed reliable. The facts as reported supported a reasonable suspicion that defendant might have been involved in criminal behavior because it was reported that there was an object in the back of the car, which appeared to be a wooden-handled shotgun. Thus, the stop was constitutional. However, the court failed to the give the notice required under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2951.04. Defendant was not informed that he had the right to request conditional probation for the purpose of treatment and rehabilitation. Thus, he was entitled to resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the trial court's evidentiary rulings. In affirming the convictions, the court held that defendants' contentions lacked merit. The court found that defendants' arrests resulted from conduct that included blocking persons from entering the building and further blocking the driveway, entrances, or exits from the medical building. Because alternative channels of communication were available, it was not necessary to block access to facilities or disrupt the operations of the medical clinic in order for defendants to exercise their constitutional guarantees to express opinion. The court found no error in the trial court's disallowance of evidence of defendants' &quot;necessity&quot; defense because necessity was not a defense if alternatives to the criminal conduct were available. Because defendants did not establish a prima facie showing of selective prosecution, there was also no error when the trial court overruled their motion to dismiss based on selective prosecution. In their motions, defendants merely made an assertion that pro-choice supporters were not arrested, which did not meet the requirements for a prima facie showing of selective prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence following his no contest plea to drunk driving, arguing that the trial court was without authority to require restitution for medical expenses because the only authority to order restitution in misdemeanor offenses was that set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.21(E). The state contended that the restitution order was authorized by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2951.02(C). The court held that it was readily perceivable from statutory scheme adopted for restitution in criminal cases that the General Assembly intended to restrict restitution to property damage and the value of property the subject of theft offenses. Had it been intended to permit restitution as to other damages suffered by a victim such as hospital expenses, doctor's bills, loss of wages and similar items of damage, both liquidated and unliquidated, it would have chosen appropriate language to reflect such intention. Thus, the trial court lacked authority to order restitution of non-property damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose out of an altercation with two other men. Defendant alleged that the other men had been the aggressors and that he had fired a firearm at them and their vehicle in self-defense. In this regard, defendant contended that the statutes under which he was charged were unconstitutionally vague and uncertain because they did not allow for self-defense. The court disagreed, and concluded that both Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.21 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.06 described the conduct they made criminal in a manner that persons of ordinary intelligence could understand. Defendant also contended that his defense was prejudiced when the trial court allowed the State to amend the indictment on the morning of the trial. The court disagreed, noting that the amendment did not change the name or identity of the crimes charged and that, under Ohio R. Crim. P. 7(D), the trial court did not err in allowing the amendment. Affirming defendant's conviction, the court found that there was sufficient, competent, and credible evidence to support each element of the offenses charged and that the jury's verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen filed a complaint against the organization, claiming that it was in violation of state election laws. The organization filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking to enjoin the secretary of state and the commission from enforcing any election statutes against it.

The court noted that the commission's and the secretary of state's position was that each had the right to proceed in the matter and to determine the issue of jurisdiction. The court found that the citizen's position was that the commission and the secretary of state had jurisdiction. The court decided that although the positions were not identical, they were congruent in that both were advocating that the commission and the secretary of state had the right to proceed. The court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the citizen's interest was adequately represented and that he did not have a right to intervene.

The court held that &sect; 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii) allowed defendant to rebut the state's prima facie showing that his dog was a vicious dog even though defendant admitted that the dog was a pit bull dog. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction and the finding that defendant acted recklessly by failing to place a proper latch on the patio gate. The court held that the trial court did not err in imposing an indefinite sentence because &sect; 2929.11(G) established no conditions for imposition of an indefinite sentence for a felony of the fourth degree pursuant to &sect; 2929.11(D). The court held that because the child's injury occurred when defendant's pit bull was not confined as prescribed by &sect; 955.22(D), the trial court did not err in concluding that defendant caused physical harm to the child during defendant's violation of &sect; 955.22(D), and in sentencing defendant to an indefinite term.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that &sect; 139.14 was unconstitutionally vague and abridged his rights to freedom of movement and association. The trial court overruled the motion to dismiss. Thereafter, the charge against defendant was amended to a violation of Dayton, Ohio, Rev. Code Gen. Ordinances &sect; 139.03(A). The prior loitering charge was dismissed in the course of the amendment. Defendant entered a plea of no contest to drug abuse. On review, defendant argued that Dayton, Ohio, Rev. Code Gen. Ordinances &sect; 139.14 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that defendant's argument became technically moot when the allegedly unconstitutional loitering charge was dismissed. Also, &sect; 139.14 and Dayton, Ohio, Rev. Code Gen. Ordinances &sect; 139.03(A) were dissimilar in their terms and provisions. Defendant's failure to provide a record prevented the court from knowing how the narcotics on which the drug abuse offense was based were obtained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought a conditional use permit from the board for construction of a childcare center in the township. Although the property was zoned for single family residential, such centers were provided for as a conditional use in the township zoning resolution. Neighbors objected because of additional traffic that would be generated in the area. The board denied the permit. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2506, the applicant filed an administrative appeal of the board's decision with the trial court and included a complaint for declaratory relief that sought a declaration that the board's application of the zoning resolution was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the complaint for declaratory relief, found that the applicant failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, and ordered that the proceeding continue as purely an administrative appeal. The trial court then issued a decision that upheld the board's determination. The court held that the board's decision was supported by a preponderance of substantial, reliable and probative evidence because it could have reasonably found that the center would have unduly burdened the surrounding uses and structures.</SPAN></P>

The probation officer stated that defendant was in violation of probation, that a warrant would be issued for his arrest, and that the officers on the scene should arrest him. After the arrest, he was taken to the police department. The narcotics officers searched his car and found marijuana below the driver's seat and in the ashtray. He sought to suppress his statement and the evidence seized. After a hearing, the trial court overruled his motion. He changed his plea from not guilty to no-contest, and he was convicted. On appeal, the court held that the arrest was invalid because the officer knew or should have known that a warrant was not issued when the arrest was made.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner appealed from a judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which dismissed its Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2506 appeal and its declaratory judgment action, which were combined for trial. The landowner sought to develop its parcel of land for multi-family residential use by building two apartment units, but defendant city denied a use exception permit under Willowick, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 1161.01(1)(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner purchased a parcel of vacant, wooded land, knowing that the property was zoned single family residential and was plotted into seven residential lots. The landowner was granted a district use exception, but this permit automatically expired after one year from issuance if the holder had not commenced construction. The landowner's permit expired, and it did not seek an extension. The landowner argued that the vacating of an alley by the city landlocked its property and made the land unsuitable for residential development. The landowner stated that the vacation combined with the denial of the use exception deprived it of the use of its property. The court found that it was premature to reach this conclusion because the landowner had not sought a variance to build residential property on the land. The landowner did not meet its burden of proving that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional because it had failed to prove beyond fair debate that all single-family residential uses were economically infeasible. The fact that the parcel could be more valuable if zoned multi-family residential was insufficient to show the single family residential classification was invalid.</SPAN></P>

The zoning request was denied, and the developer commenced a declaratory judgment action. The trial court found the R-1A zoning unconstitutional and ordered the village to rezone the property. The village appealed. The trial court weighed the evidence presented by the developer and the municipality and concluded in its sound discretion that the developer had met the &quot;beyond fair debate&quot; test. Moreover, the trial court found that if the land were developed to meet the R-1A requirements, the owner would suffer a loss. The record contained ample competent, credible evidence to support this finding. The developer offered four experts who gave testimony and presented evidence that the property could only be developed as R1-A at a loss. Although the village presented witnesses who testified that a loss would not be suffered, the trial judge made his determination and the reviewing court would not substitute its judgment for his.</SPAN></P>

When substantial amounts of sewage began to percolate under appellee's building, appellee had an illegal sewer pipe connection coming from the restaurant into appellees' basement capped off and cut off appellant's access to the public sewer. Appellant filed suit to establish that it had an easement to tap into the disputed sewer line. During the pendency of the action for declaratory and injunctive relief, a municipal board granted a conditional building code variance allowing continued operation of the offending connection, but the board declined to rule on whether the restaurant had an easement to access appellees' sewer line. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees because the court found as a matter of law that the sewer tap-in constituted a &quot;public nuisance&quot; in violation of the currently applicable plumbing code. On appeal, the court found that there were triable issues regarding implied easement and whether the sewer was in operation prior to severance of the realty from a common grantor.

During the investigation, the police went to the home of the decedent's brother and sought to record a conversation between the decedent's sister-in-law and the accused. The brother had told police that the accused had asked his wife to give false testimony regarding the decedent's abusive ways. The police recorded three conversations. The accused made no statements that could be construed as suborning perjury and none of the recordings was used at trial. The accused became aware of the police conduct and after trial, sued them for violations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, intentional infliction of emotional distress, violation of her privacy rights, and malicious prosecution. On appeal from a judgment for the police, the court held that: (1) police actions did not violate the Constitution or laws of the United States because it was not a violation of the accused's Sixth Amendment rights to obtain statements from an individual prior to indictment; (2) the investigating officer was qualifiedly immune from liability; and (3) the city was not liable when the accused had not proved a policy or custom.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject of the appeal was whether Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 5717.05, as amended effective March 17, 1989, was unconstitutional and whether the trial court's reliance thereon in dismissing the property owners' administrative appeals was unreasonable or unlawful. The property owners were not precluded from raising and preserving their constitutional arguments in the proceedings before the Board of Tax Appeals (BTA). Thus, they were not denied the opportunity to be heard. Nor were they denied the right to assert their constitutional claims, which could have been raised before the BTA, the Ohio Supreme Court or the courts of appeals following the conclusion of the BTA proceedings. The general jurisdictional provisions of the court of common pleas were inapplicable and there was no conflict of jurisdiction. The court upheld the constitutional validity of &sect; 5717.05 and dismissed the property owners' due process attacks. Pursuant to &sect; 5717.05 the trial court correctly concluded it lacked jurisdiction. Accordingly, it was not unreasonable, unlawful or an abuse of discretion to grant the boards of education's motion to dismiss and the property owners' contentions to the contrary lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The city contended that, for purposes of the sign regulations, the two streets were to be considered as one, even though they were named differently. The city relied upon &sect; 3377.4203, which provided that an off-premise site location for a graphic sign of a certain size had to be separated from every other off-premises sign along the same street by no less than a certain distance, and the proposed sign was less than that distance from the existing sign. On appeal to the trial court, it found for the Commission, but the court reversed. The company had presented evidence that the City had dedicated the streets separately, not as the same street. The court agreed and found that the evidence permitted only one conclusion, that the two streets were indeed completely separate and not one as argued by the Commission. Because the two roads were different streets, it was both unlawful and an abuse of discretion for the Commission to attempt to treat them as if they were a single street.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appeared before the trial court to address criminal charges pending in five cases.

In addition, he pleaded guilty to a fourth degree felony in two other cases, and to an aggravated felony of the second degree in a fourth case. The trial court accepted the plea and, at the state's request, dismissed the fifth case and nolled the remaining counts in the various indictments. He was then sentenced. He filed a motion to correct the sentence, which was denied. He was then granted leave to filed a delayed appeal. On appeal, the court found that the trial court substantially complied with Ohio R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction for possession of cocaine and possession of criminal tools. Defendant had signed a waiver and, thus, his speedy trial rights were not violated. The denial of defendant's request to review the grand jury record was not an abuse of discretion because he failed to demonstrate a particularized need for the grand jury testimony. Defendant was not deprived of a fair trial because the State had offered testimony regarding defendant's presence during the execution of a search warrant but had never introduced evidence of &quot;other acts&quot; for the purpose of showing that defendant acted in conformity therewith. An amendment to the indictment under Ohio R. Crim. P. 7(D) was necessary to conform to the evidence and was constitutional because it did not change the name, identity, penalty, or degree of the crime charged. Finally, defendant failed to demonstrate that he had been denied effective assistance by his counsel's failure to file a motion to suppress the evidence that defendant had thrown away when approached by police. Defendant no longer retained a reasonable expectation of privacy with the evidence once he voluntarily disposed of it.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the applicant incurred practical difficulties upon the denial of the variance. On the Board's appeal, the court reviewed the relevant standards of review and held that its review of the Board's decision was more limited than that of the trial court. However, the trial court had applied the standard of practical difficulties, which was applicable to area variances, rather than the standard of unnecessary hardship, which was the proper standard for use variances.

The court affirmed and ruled that the verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence where evidence supported jury's finding that a loaded gun &quot;shoved into&quot; defendant's waistband was &quot;concealed&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 2923.12.

The court found that some provisions of the ordinance were unconstitutional. The court held that: (1) summary judgment was improperly granted on count one because plaintiff was not afforded an opportunity for discovery; (2) the failure to provide notice of the converted motion to dismiss to one for summary judgment would be prejudicial if the motion to dismiss could not have been granted on the remaining counts; (3) the motion to dismiss would have been granted on the strict scrutiny argument because ordinances passed by virtue of the state's police powers were subject to the rational basis standard; and (4) the supremacy clause argument would not have survived a motion to dismiss because the ordinance directly conflicted with a federal statute that authorized certain persons to transport weapons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of the judgment granting summary judgment on count one before adequate discovery was provided, reversed that part of the judgment granting summary judgment on the supremacy clause allegation, and affirmed the remaining parts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner sought to rezone 19 acres. The trustees accepted a recommendation of the regional planning commission that the rezoning encompass 45 acres including the 19 acres. Township residents submitted referendum petitions to the trustees requesting that the rezoning be placed on the next primary ballot. The petitions referenced a 19 acre parcel. The property owner claimed that the petitions were void because they referenced a 19-acre parcel instead of the 45 acre parcel. The board of elections determined that the petitions were insufficient. Appellants filed a complaint seeking to compel the board to place the rezoning on the ballot. The court denied the complaint. Appellants filed an amended complaint. In reversing, the court held that: (1) the rezoning of the property owner's property was not an effective zoning because there was not a proper legislative enactment; (2) the zoning commission's failure to mail notice to all landowners within, contiguous to, and directly across the street from the property proposed for rezoning was a deprivation of due process to those landowners; and (3) an earlier amendment to the township's zoning laws was not properly enacted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the mother was 20 years old, had an IQ of 40, lived at home under unsafe and unsanitary conditions, had progressed in her personal skills probably to the optimum, and had none of the abilities necessary to provide for the care and support of an infant child. In addition, her infant son had certain special needs for which she could not provide. The mother did not challenge the facts as found by the trial court but argued that her due process rights had been violated because her parental rights were terminated without an effort at reunification. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.353(A)(4) allowed termination of parental rights upon a finding of dependency, upon certain pre-conditions, but without the imperative of a reunification or case plan. The court found that &sect; 2151.353(A)(4) did not amount to an unconstitutional deprivation of property rights without due process either upon its face or upon the application of the facts in the mother's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of a court of common pleas (Ohio), which found him to be a probation violator and ordered him to serve the balance of his suspended sentence prior to and consecutive with the sentences imposed in four other cases and to serve five years probation. The underlying conviction in the probation case was for two counts of passing bad checks. The convictions in the other cases were for theft and passing bad checks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in imposing a term of five years probation in addition to reinstating the original term of incarceration and in finding him a probation violator. The trial court found that defendant's convictions in the four other cases constituted a probation violation, even though the underlying offenses occurred prior to defendant's sentencing in the probation case. The court determined that a trial court possessed the discretion to impose a longer sentence after revocation of a defendant's probation, within the purview of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2951.09, without violating the defendant's constitutional right against double jeopardy. The only case in which a court did not have the power to increase a post-revocation sentence was where shock probation was granted pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2992.51(B) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2947.061. The court affirmed and concluded that revocation of probation based upon acts committed by a defendant prior to probation, of which the sentencing court was not made aware, was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the prosecutor was authorized to implement a pretrial diversion program for offenders under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.36(A). The court rejected defendants' argument that procedural due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. amend.

The court found that defendants would not have suffered a loss of a presently enjoyed interest and were not entitled to procedural due process.

One year before the decedent's death, he and the administrator brought an action in the trial court against the employer alleging common law and statutory intentional torts and loss of consortium. After the decedent's death, the administrator also alleged wrongful death. The trial court granted the employer's motion for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the intentional tort claim was time barred because it arose when the decedent became aware of his condition and the limitations period expired two years later, long before the start of the suit, and (2) the wrongful death claim was timely because it was filed within two years of the decedent's death, and (3) the fact that the decedent's claims were time barred had no effect on the administrator's right to sue for his wrongful death.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(A)(7). The trial court imposed the death penalty upon a jury's recommendation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial a witness reluctantly testified that the victim told him that defendant had previously threatened to kill him. The trial court allowed the evidence to form the basis for the victim's excited utterance. Defendant was found guilty, and members of his family testified in mitigation in an attempt to avoid the death penalty. The State provided rebuttal evidence to contradict the family's testimony concerning defendant's attributes. On appeal, the court held that the witness's hearsay testimony as to threats made on the victim's life were admissible to establish a background for the victim's excited utterance. Further, the reliability of the statement was inferred. The court also held that the State's cross-examination of defendant's mitigation witnesses was proper. The evidence presented was not in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(A) because the State was permitted to controvert each of defendant's claims presented in mitigation. Finally, the court agreed that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating based on the evidence, such as his participation in a common design of aggravated murder and robbery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, including the sentence of death, with directions to carry the judgment into execution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the City of Cleveland and a police officer, appealed a decision from the Common Pleas Court (Ohio), entering judgment in favor of plaintiffs, a cook and his wife, in their personal injury action. Plaintiffs appealed the decision denying their motion for pre-judgment interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer was employed by the City. The officer was on duty when he went to a restaurant to fill out his paperwork. The officer was on friendly terms with the restaurant's cook. The officer allowed the cook to handle the officer's unloaded gun. While the officer was reloading it, he accidentally shot the cook. The cook and his wife initiated an action. The trial court denied the City's motion for a directed verdict on the issue of whether the officer's conduct was within the scope of his employment. Plaintiffs were then awarded a judgment. The City appealed, and plaintiffs appealed the decision denying their motion for pre-judgment interest. In affirming the decision, the court found that the trial court properly denied the City's motion. There was no rule that prohibited an officer from showing his weapon to the public if requested. Evidence of the disciplinary proceedings arising from shooting was properly excluded because its probative value was outweighed by its tendency to mislead the jury. The City had a reasonable belief that there was no liability in the case, so plaintiffs were properly denied pre-judgment interest.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court affirmed. The common law insanity test was applied to his crimes because they occurred prior to the amendment of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.01. The burden of proving insanity was upon defendant by a preponderance of the evidence. There was ample evidence for the trial court's decision that defendant had the capacity either to know the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. The trier of fact chose to give more emphasis to a doctor's report regarding defendant's awareness of the wrongfulness of his actions. Defendant acknowledged that after he knocked his father down, he knew that his father was in pain yet purposely refused help because defendant was mad at him. Secondly, defendant admitted that he knew attacking his father was wrong.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 3111.04, seeking to establish that defendant alleged father was the father of a certain illegitimate child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the child's mother assigned her right to receive child support to the Department. The Department contented that &sect; 3111.04 was preempted by federal law, namely, Title IV-A and Title IV-D of the Social Security Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 601 through 615 and 651 through 666, and that it had standing to institute a parentage action. The court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that, because the Department did not raise the issue of federal preemption in the lower court, it could not raise it on appeal. The court held that the Department did not have standing to institute a parentage action. The court reasoned that &sect; 3111.04 was clear that only a child, the child's mother, a person alleged to be the child's father, or a personal representative of any of the three could maintain a parentage action. The court explained that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3111.07(B) merely authorized a county department of human services to intervene after the commencement of a parentage action by a proper party but did not authorize the Department to institute a parentage action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city acquired certain water mains that extended beyond the city's limits into the township for the purpose of supplying water for fire hydrants. The city enacted Columbus, Ohio, Ordinance No. 2496-83 and Columbus, Ohio, City Code &sect; 2517.06, which declared that the fire hydrants in the township were not part of the city's water system and disclaimed its duty to maintain the fire hydrants. The township brought an action to recover the amount it had spent in repairing fire hydrants and to obtain a declaratory judgment that the city could not disclaim its duty to maintain. On appeal, the court first held that the city had a duty to maintain the fire hydrants unless an ordinance disclaimed or terminated that duty. The court found that Columbus, Ohio, Ordinance No. 2496-83 properly disclaimed the duty and did not exceed the city's home rule power, did not conflict with any state statutes, and was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The court also held that because the city's maintaining the fire hydrants did not constitute a representation that the city had a duty to maintain them perpetually, the city was not equitably estopped from terminating its duty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff asserted that because he filed a notice of dismissal pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 41(A)(1), and voluntarily dismissed the action, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to issue the judgment entry granting the motions to dismiss. Defendants disagreed and contended that because plaintiff filed his Rule 41(A)(1) notice of dismissal four days after the trial court issued and, as defendants contended, journalized its decision to grant the four motions to dismiss, the notice of dismissal did not dismiss the action. The court found no merit to defendants' contention. The trial court's announcements of its decision were not judgment entries. The critical question was whether the trial court had jurisdiction to issue a judgment entry dismissing the action after plaintiff had voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice. The court found that plaintiff's Rule 41(A)(1) notice of dismissal divested the trial court of authority to subsequently dismiss the action or to issue any further orders in the case. Thus the court was required to set aside the judgment. Consequently, the court was without jurisdiction to address the merits of plaintiff's assignments of error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the president of a corporation located in the city. Pursuant to Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code &sect;&sect; 1905.06 to .07, the corporation had to withhold a city income tax from its employees' paychecks and remit it to city. Defendant assumed control of the financial affairs of the corporation and failed to pay the taxes. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court refused to address defendant's constitutional argument because it was not raised in the trial court. Defendant's claimed inability to pay the taxes was an affirmative defense that defendant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence. Defendant's willful and intentional failure to pay the taxes was shown by the fact that the amounts due had been withheld from employee paychecks, a tax return was filed, he admitted to being responsible for the corporate debts, and he negotiated a payment plan with the city. It was reasonable to infer that defendant knew of the taxes and engaged in a course of conduct with the intent to avoid payment of those taxes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seller owned a business that it claimed sold only wholesale fireworks. City police officers entered the premises and informed the seller's operator that he would have to close the store or face arrest because it was illegal to sell fireworks in the city. The operator complied. A search warrant was later executed and all fireworks and records were seized. The seller filed a complaint in the trial court seeking injunctive relief, a declaratory judgment, and an award of damages and attorney fees. Appellees filed a motion to dismiss, and judgment was entered in favor of appellees. On appeal, the court reversed, holding first that the trial court's statement regarding the seller's lack of a vendor's license was harmless error because its decision was based on a lack jurisdiction. However, the court found that the trial court erred in finding that it lacked jurisdiction due to the seller's failure to join the attorney general under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12. The seller was not challenging the constitutionality of the fireworks statutes but whether or not they even existed. As to that issue, the court held that pending legislation did not repeal Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(4) entered by the Common Pleas Court of Paulding County (Ohio). The trial court sentenced defendant to a prison term and imposed a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a search warrant, the sheriff's department searched defendant's home and seized 239 grams of marijuana and other evidence. As such, defendant was charged with trafficking in marijuana, for knowingly possessing the controlled substance in an amount equal to or exceeding the bulk amount, that is 200 grams, but, in an amount less than three times that bulk amount. After a trial, the jury determined that defendant knowingly possessed more than 200 grams of marijuana and found him guilty of drug trafficking. Defendant was sentenced to prison and fined $ 1000.00 to be disbursed to the sheriff's department drug enforcement fund. The court held that the evidence of the scales, zip lock bags, and a roach clip found in defendant's home, when taken together, were relevant under Ohio R. Evid. 401 and 403 to the jury's determination that defendant trafficked in marijuana. The court further found that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03 it was reasonable to conclude that the possession of bulk amounts of a controlled substance was likely to result in trafficking. The court also held that the State's references to drug trafficking during closing arguments was not improper.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 149.43 to compel the production of documents relating to a murder. Respondents, the City of Cleveland, the Director of Public Safety, the Chief of Police, and the Mayor, released several documents to relator and submitted others to the court for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator sought access to documents by seeking a writ of mandamus. Respondents claimed various exemptions under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 149.43. The court found that certain witness statements, taken as a part of a homicide investigation, were not specifically trial preparation documents and were not exempt. The court determined that notes taken during trial were compiled specifically to assist the prosecutor at trial and were therefore exempt as trial preparation. The personal notes of the prosecutor and the detectives taken during trial were exempt as well, even if not considered to be trial preparation. The court declined to exempt as trial preparation the report of laboratory findings from the coroner's office. The court rejected respondents' argument that relator failed to establish the lack of an adequate remedy to obtain the records because he could have used Ohio R. Crim. P. 16 or he could have utilized discovery in his postconviction relief action. The court held that relator established a legal right to the records the court deemed public in whole or in part.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' vehicles were seized during an on-going investigation after it was found that the vehicles' identification numbers were destroyed, mismatched, or missing. The trial court dismissed all three petitions for forfeiture on the grounds that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4549.62 was unconstitutional and the forfeiture procedures of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.43 were not followed. On appeal the State claimed that the trial court erred in finding that Ohio Rev.

The court held that the forfeiture of an altered vehicle or a vehicle part for knowledgeable possession was not an excessive fine or cruel and unusual punishment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city subjected the property owners to improvement projects assessments and the property owners filed an action seeking to enjoin collection and recover illegal assessment collected by the city. The trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court held that under Ohio Rev.

The court found that the property owners' affidavit and exhibits did not show the time of collection, as the period that the evidence related to the billing date that was nearly one year after the time when the assessment was due. The court determined that the property owners failed to show that they had complied with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2723.01's statute of limitations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' action was dismissed by way of summary judgment as untimely. They filed a motion to amend the judgment, claiming that they were not given notice of the judgment and, therefore, were precluded from filing a timely appeal, which was overruled. Over three years later the parents filed a notice of appeal of the summary judgment, which was dismissed. In conjunction with that action the parents filed a complaint in mandamus, which was also dismissed. The court held that although mandamus was the proper remedy to compel a lower court to set aside and vacate an order, it could find no authority to compel a trial court to exercise its discretion to refile a judgment entry so as to change its effective date. The best procedure for dealing with a claim of no reasonable notice was to filed an Ohio R. Civ. P. 60(B) motion, which was not done. The court found that the parents failed to timely appeal the denial of their motion and instead waited over three years before appealing the original judgment. Because a final judgment had been issued and no direct appeal or post-judgment motions permitted by the Rules of Civil Procedure were pursued, the parents were not entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant alleged, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of aggravated drug trafficking and drug abuse because there was no evidence that he possessed the drugs found. The court noted that the pills were found near the site of the accident and that there was evidence that defendant returned to search the area the next day. Also, some of the pill containers and prescription forms were labeled with defendant's name. The court held, however, that the state failed to prove that defendant had violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.23(B)(2) because there was no evidence that the uncompleted preprinted prescription blanks found were false or forged. Although certain forms had been photocopied, they were not uncompleted prescription blanks as required by the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant initially pled not guilty and, through counsel, filed a motion to suppress/motion to dismiss/motion in limine. The motion sought to limit or suppress (1) results of defendant's field sobriety and breath tests, (2) defendant's statements relative to alcohol consumption, and (3) police testimony relative to defendant's sobriety. The motion listed nine grounds upon which defendant asserted suppression or limitation of evidence should be had. The trial court denied defendant an evidentiary hearing on most grounds because they were insufficient as a matter of law on their face to require a hearing. A hearing was held on the only remaining ground for suppression, whether the police had probable cause to stop or detain defendant. Following the hearing the trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress. The court found that a motion in limine relative to an intoxilyzer test was the equivalent of a motion to suppress, and concluded that items in defendant's motions were claims that would have justified relief if established. Accordingly, the trial court erred in not scheduling an evidentiary hearing on the issues.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the prosecution's complaint on the ground that it failed to charge an offense against her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the prosecution's complaint against her and erred in refusing to grant a judgment of acquittal on the ground that defendant did not maintain an adult entertainment facility as defined by &sect; 30.03. The court agreed with defendant and held that &sect; 30.03 failed to make it an offense to conduct the alleged use absent a permit. Operating an adult entertainment facility without a permit was not prohibited by &sect; 30.03. Section 30.03 did not contain any words of prohibition. Although &sect; 30.04 contained language describing prohibited conduct, defendant was never charged with violating any of these conditions set forth in &sect; 30.04. Instead, the record indicated that the nature of the charge against defendant was that she operated an adult entertainment facility in a HB zoning district without a conditional use permit, even though &sect; 30.03 of the zoning ordinance did not proscribe this type of conduct. Nowhere in the zoning enactment was it stated that no person shall engage in a conditional use without first obtaining a permit.</SPAN></P>

After a bench trial, the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) found defendant guilty on all counts and he appealed. The trial court also denied defendant's motions to suppress narcotics found in his car during an inventory search, and for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 29.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer noticed that the taillights of defendant's car were out and asked defendant about it when he exited his car. The officer issued defendant a citation for no rear illumination on his vehicle and asked for his keys, informing defendant that his car would be impounded. The officer made an inventory of the car and noticed a plastic baggie in plain view lying on the floorboard of the driver's side, halfway between the seat and the pedals. The baggie appeared to contain some type of cards with a psychedelic design on them. They were later identified as LSD. Defendant argued that the search of his car was in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The court disagreed and held that a routine inventory search of a lawfully impounded automobile was not unreasonable when performed pursuant to standard police practice, and when the evidence did not demonstrate that the procedure involved was merely a pretext for an evidentiary search of the impounded automobile. The court held that the car was lawfully impounded under Cleveland, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 405.02(g), and that the inventory was taken so that defendant could not claim that any items were missing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police seized a cocaine/baking soda mixture containing less than one percent cocaine.

Although the trial court improperly struck the testimony of defendant's expert witness as to a layman's inability to detect the cocaine in the baking soda mixture, the error was not prejudicial in view of the existing, uncontroverted testimony that the mixture contained a miniscule amount of cocaine. A detective's affidavit provided a substantial basis for the trial court's conclusion that there was probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant based upon information provided by an informant.

This doctrine was enunciated by the Ohio Supreme Court in a case decided after defendant's conviction. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Defendant failed to cite any cases in support of his contention that involved the retrospective application of Ohio Supreme Court decisions to criminal cases. The factors to be considered in deciding to retroactively apply as case were the purpose of the new rule or decision, the reliance placed upon the old rule, and the effect on the administration of justice of a retrospective application of the new decision. The court held that, if applied retrospectively, the decision would require new trials in all cases in which defendant was found guilty of the firearm specification set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.71. Such an application would be costly in economic terms for obvious reasons as well as in terms of justice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed on appeal that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to vacate or set aside sentences and motion for summary judgment without requiring the State to answer or respond to the motions. The court ruled that the State's failure to file a response or answer to defendant's motions did not require judgment in his favor because a defendant could not obtain a default judgment in a post-conviction proceeding. The court further ruled that defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to contend that defendant's rape conviction was improper as force was not alleged or proven and there was no medical corroboration of the rape because force was not an element of the rape of a child under 13 years of age under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02 and there was no requirement that a rape victim's testimony be corroborated as a condition precedent to conviction. Rejecting defendant's claim that the post-conviction statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21, was unconstitutional, the court ruled that the fact that the statute allowed state courts to implement the doctrine of res judicata did not deprive litigants of constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner purchased a parcel of land, with the intention of building a large multi-unit apartment complex. A zoning change was required to develop the property according to the owner's plans, which was denied by the Board. The owner challenged the constitutionality of the zoning code as applied to his property. The trial court entered judgment supporting the Board's decision. The court held that the Board properly denied the owner's application for zone change. The court found that there was no evidence that the land was useless as zoned. The court concluded that the zoning regulation was not confiscatory, and found that the trial court did not err by finding that the owner's proposed use was not the only reasonable use for the property. The court further concluded that there was competent, credible evidence to support the trial court's finding that the zoning regulation, as applied, substantially advanced the county's legitimate interest in the health, safety, and welfare of the community.</SPAN></P>

The patient sought review of an order of a trial court (Ohio) that granted the hospital's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient alleged that the physician performed unnecessary experimental surgery upon her. The trial court granted the hospital summary judgment upon a finding that the action was barred under the one-year limitations period in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B). On appeal, the patient argued that &sect; 2305.11(B) was unconstitutional as applied to her. The court rejected that argument, noting that the patient had relied upon a decision wherein a patient who did not know that she had been the victim of medical malpractice had failed to bring her action within four years. The court decision was inapplicable because the patient had brought her action within four years of the accrual of the action. The court also rejected the patient's argument that the hospital's fraud barred its right to assert the statute of limitations because the action against the hospital sounded in negligence. The trial court erred, however, in granting summary judgment because the patient's affidavit established that the patient did not know about the alleged malpractice until after the one-year limitations period had run and there was no evidence that the patient should have known within that time period.</SPAN></P>

Defendant made a voluntary statement to the police after his arrest. Defendant asserted that this statement should have been suppressed.

The court further found that defendant's oral statement subsequent to his arrest was not a response to interrogation, but was a volunteered statement, which would have been admissible. Defendant also challenged the trial court's failure to merge all five counts of felonious assault. The court found that the trial court correctly sentenced defendant because the five counts did not merge pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25. The court concluded that the offenses committed by defendant were five offenses of dissimilar import, and that the trial court was correct in sentencing him on all five counts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action against appellee Ohio Bureau of Employment Services, appellant employer challenged a judgment from the Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), dismissing the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, under Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). The employer asserted that the trial court erred in considering matters outside the pleadings and in dismissing the action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer filed a declaratory judgment action against the Bureau, seeking an exemption from liability to the unemployment compensation fund. The trial court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On appeal, the employer argued that the trial court improperly considered matters outside the pleadings and wrongly found that it had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. The court disagreed, explaining that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4141.01 et seq. listed the administrative remedies to be exhausted by the employer in contesting its liability and rate determination. The employer was required to file an application with a board of review and only then seek judicial review. Failing to follow this process necessitated dismissal of the appeal under Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In making this determination, the trial court properly referred to extraneous materials. The affidavit attached to the motion to dismiss demonstrated that the employer had not exhausted its administrative remedies before filing the action in which it relied on a statutory exemption. Thus, the trial court had no jurisdiction over the subject matter.</SPAN></P>

The park maintained that the trial court erred in not finding a conflict between the city ordinance and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3733.02, which allowed 12 units per acre. The court held that given the plain language of both the statute and the ordinance, neither the trial court nor the park should have inferred density requirements. The court found that there was no conflict between Ord. No. 150.105 and Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant foster parents sought review of the trial court's adoption of a referee's report and recommendation to deny the parents' motion for permanent custody of their former foster child. The child was then in the permanent custody of appellee Montgomery County Children Services Board (CSB). Pending appeal, the child remained in the parents' home and was available for supervised visitation with CSB's prospective adoptive couple.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Racially, the child was black and the parents were white. The parents argued that CSB rejected them as an adoptive home for the child based solely on their race, in violation of the Equal Protection Clauses of the state and federal constitutions, and that, in deferring to CSB, the trial court abused its discretion by failing to consider the child's best interests. The parents also alleged that the trial court improperly adopted the referee's report and recommendation without reviewing the evidence. The court first determined that the parents had standing. The court then held that the trial court erred when it failed to review and to consider the transcript before adopting the referee's report and recommendation. Although the court concluded that the trial court could have reached either conclusion on the issue of whether the child's interests would be better served by the CSB's proposed adoption, or whether her interests would be better served by awarding her legal custody to the parents, the court also held that CSB's policy of restricting the adoption of black children in its custody to black couples was unconstitutional because it relied upon race to an impermissible extent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for further consideration. Upon remand, the court directed the trial court to make a determination of the child's best interests, without deference to the CSB's determination. The court stated that race could be used as a factor in making that determination, but only as one factor among many and that it could not predominate to the exclusion of other considerations.</SPAN></P>

More than four years later, the sheriff's department ordered appellee to serve his jail term. Appellee filed motions to vacate the sentences. The trial court vacated the sentences on the ground that imposition of a sentence after the expiration of appellee's probation term violated Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a prohibited blood alcohol level. Defendant and the prosecution stipulated to the facts, as well as to the notion that defendant's blood alcohol level could have both risen and fallen from the time he was driving and when the test was administered. Had it fallen to the maximum degree stipulated, it would have been below the legal limit. Defendant entered a nolo contendere plea and appealed. The prosecution asserted that in such pleas, evidentiary issues were not preserved for review. The court disagreed, finding that the facts underlying the finding of guilt were reviewable. Nevertheless, the court found that the evidence set forth by defendant was not sufficient to warrant reversal because he only presented evidence that he might not have been guilty under the stipulated facts, not that he was not. Thus, under the stipulation, there was sufficient evidence to convict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought review of a decision of the Mahoning County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which dismissed the complaint and found in favor of defendants, the president of a township park district, a board of park commissioners, and associated others. Plaintiffs had sought a preliminary injunction against execution of the conversion of the township park district into a county-wide park district and levy and a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioners of the township park district initiated a conversion of the township park district into a county-wide park district. Prior to the conversion, the park was supported by residents of the city. The effect of passage of the issue was to reduce the millage upon the city's residents and to raise the millage imposed upon all other owners of property within the county. In affirming the decision, the court overruled the assignment of error that the levy did not have uniform application throughout the county in that the city residents' tax was reduced and the non-city residents' tax was increased. The fact that the tax burden on some residents of the newly created conversion district was different than the tax burden upon others at a time prior to the conversion did not constitute a denial of equal protection of the laws. Consistent with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.54, the court concluded that the city park district was created pursuant to legislative authorization that was codified in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 511.18. Am. Sub. H.B. 231, Gen. Assem. (Ohio) complied with the one subject requirement of the Ohio Constitution found in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The natural mother of a minor child challenged the award of permanent custody to the agency. The trial court found that a permanent custody order would facilitate an adoption that would eventually provide the child with a permanent home. The finding was supported by clear and convincing evidence. Evidence also supported the finding that the child could not be placed with the mother within a reasonable time. The existence of only one factor under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.414(E) was needed to justify the court's decision. Clear and convincing evidence supported the conclusion that the mother demonstrated a lack of commitment toward her child. The mother alleged that the trial court had no jurisdiction to conduct a permanent custody hearing. The court agreed. The court found that Am. Sub. S.B. 89, &sect; 7, 142 Ohio Laws, Pt. I, 198, 264, terminated the agency's temporary custody order on January 1, 1990. The mother argued that the time limits specified in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.353 and Ohio Rev.

The landowners and the lessee also filed a cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 7.13.1 prohibited the application of sludge to any land in the township. The landowners leased a portion of their farm to the lessee, which was in the business of hauling sludge for agricultural purposes. They contended that &sect; 7.13.1 was void and unenforceable because it conflicted with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 6111.46 and Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 3745-31-02(A). Both of the state laws allowed the disposal of sludge under certain circumstances. After the trial court entered judgment in favor of the landowners and the lessee, both sides of the controversy sought review. In affirming, the court determined that Southeast Providence, Ohio, Zoning Regulation &sect; 7.13.1 (1989) prohibited what the state laws allowed. Section 7.13.1 impeded the operations of the landowners and the lessee in a substantive and significant way. In addition, the disposal of sewage was a problem of statewide concern and was not appropriate for local disposition. The court also held that appellants exceeded their authority by enacting &sect; 7.13.1 because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.21 limited their authority to prohibit the use of land for agricultural purposes. Finally, the court refused to consider the cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions for aggravated murder. The court determined that the procedure used in the DNA analysis was reliable and therefore relevant and admissible under Ohio R. Evid. 402. It was not error to admit the evidence of the DNA analysis of the blood even though defendant did not have an opportunity to have an independent test conducted. It was not error to allow the State to impeach its witness by extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement. Nor was it an abuse of discretion to permit certain witnesses to testify. The court rejected defendant's argument that the State unconstitutionally used its peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from the jury. Additionally, there was substantial evidence upon which the jury could reasonably conclude that defendant was guilty of the murders. The trial court abused its discretion in admitting a hearsay statement because it was not made in close proximity of time to the perceived event and because it was not made to an individual capable of verifying the accuracy of the statement. However, the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

The taxing authority filed a motion for summary judgment, alleging that the business made sales within the taxing district between a certain amount of time but did not file returns or pay any taxes. The trial court granted the motion and found that the taxpayer was obligated to pay the taxes at issue. The business appealed. The business argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it was a law of general nature that was not uniformly applied throughout the state and that it was unconstitutional as applied to the business. The court found that the statute was sound. The court reasoned that the legislature could recognize existing conditions and enact statutes that were deemed uniform for dealing with those unequal conditions in a rational way. The court found that islands, such as where the taxing authority was based, had unequal conditions that the statute sought to deal with in a rational manner.

In affirming the Authority's decision, the trial court refused to address the issue of whether the employee's rights had been violated, finding that because he was an employee at will, he had not protectible property interest in his employment. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in not allowing the employee's action to proceed as an administrative appeal because under Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code, the trial court had the power to reverse the Authority's termination of a disciplinary action taken against an at-will employee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a countywide election, several recounts were required. Fifteen days after the county board of elections first declared the election results, but before the results of all of the recounts were declared, the challengers held a meeting to determine the county's Republican leadership. After the recounts were certified, the incumbents held a meeting for the same purpose. The state party resolved that the incumbents were entitled to the county leadership. The challengers appealed to the trial court for injunctions, damages, and declaratory relief. The court held that the incumbents did not hold their organizational meeting within the time period prescribed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3517.04. The challengers held a timely meeting, but failed to comply with &sect; 3517.04's requirements that the meeting had to be convened by the retiring party chairman or secretary, nor were required notices sent out under the auspices of the retiring secretary. The state party had the right to determine the county party leadership between the two factions, and the court refused to interfere with its decision. The trial court properly declined to issue injunctions against the incumbents' activities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state seized 730 chickens as evidence of cockfighting. After an association of gamefowl breeders and an association member pleaded no contest to cockfighting charges, the state filed an application for forfeiture of the chickens. The trial court granted the application and ordered the humane destruction of the chickens. On appeal, the court dismissed with respect to the association member, finding that he lacked standing. However, the court held that the association possessed the requisite standing to appeal on behalf of its members, and that the association's attempt to intervene had been sufficient to entitle it, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.43(C), to at least four weeks' preparation time prior to the forfeiture hearing. Moreover, the court reversed the trial court's judgment on the association's first assignment of error, concluding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.41(D) did not authorize the trial court to order the destruction of the chickens, but held that the association's second assignment of error with respect to a double jeopardy claim was waived because it had not been raised before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

In particular, the court held that the association had standing to appeal on behalf of its members, that it had been entitled to at least four weeks preparation prior to the forfeiture hearing, and that the trial court lacked authority under state law to order the destruction of the chickens.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment, and appellant sought review. Appellant contended that appellee officers lacked probable cause or reasonable suspicion to stop and arrest him and that he was only stopped because he was black. The court concluded that, even construing the facts most strongly for appellant, appellee officers' conduct was objectively reasonable in the light of existing case law. Thus, appellee officers were immune from any liability premised on alleged violations of U.S. Const. amend. IV. Further, the court held that the trial court correctly rendered summary judgment in favor of appellee police chief, appellee city, and appellee mayor. There was no evidence that these appellees had any actual knowledge of the alleged discriminatory practices prior to appellant's arrest. However, the court held that judgment was incorrectly entered in favor of appellee officers with regard to appellant's &sect; 1985 conspiracy claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted upon a guilty plea to one count of forgery and was sentenced by the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas to a term of one and one-half years' imprisonment. When the inmate violated the terms of his probation, the probation was revoked, and the original sentence was reimposed. Pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 32.2, that trial court made a determination that the inmate was to be credited with 282 days served. Respondents refused and were only willing to credit 128 days' for confinement because, in part, a halfway house in which the sheriff confined the inmate was not on respondent's approved facility list. The court affirmed and held that there was no statutory provision conferring a right upon respondents to ignore the trial court's determination and to substitute their own calculations. Respondents had a clear legal duty under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adjoining landowners built a fence along one half of a boundary line and then requested that the landowners build the other half. The landowners refused to comply. The adjoining landowners complained to the township pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 971.04, which required the landowners to share in the expense of maintaining and constructing partition fences. After viewing the land, the township ordered the landowners to build their half. On appeal by the landowners, the trial court ordered the landowners to pay the adjoining landowners for half of the fence already built and to complete their half. The landowners sought review, claiming that the judgment was not sustained by the evidence and was contrary to law. The court reversed and ruled that the trial court erred in ordering the landowners to pay for half the fence and build the remaining portion. Section 971.04 required the township to show that the landowners would receive benefits from the fence that equaled or outweighed the cost. Thus, where the township presented no evidence that the value of the fence equaled or exceeded the cost, the trial court's ruling was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed numerous legislative acts for the reservoir. The citizens placed petitions on the ballot to repeal an ordinance for the advertisement for bids and a resolution declaring the necessity of the reservoir. The petitions passed. However, the city passed another ordinance for issuing bonds. On appeal, the court found no reversible error. First, the court held that the initiating petitions by the citizens were unconstitutional because they impaired contracts entered into by the city. The court then found that the trial erred in holding that the initiating petitions (also known as ordinances) repealed the wrong enabling ordinances. However, in light of the court's other rulings, the error was not reversible. Next, the court held that the initiating ordinances could have been superceded by the legislation after the election. Repeal by implication applied. The court next held that the suit was untimely under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 733.60.

As a result of a plea bargain, defendant pled guilty to the charges in the first indictment, the corrupt activity charge in the second indictment, and agreed to the criminal forfeiture of 141 parcels of real estate, and personal property. Defendant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas after he was sentenced. The court ordered the matter remanded for a rehearing on the motions to withdraw guilty pleas. On an initial appeal, the court vacated the criminal forfeiture sentencing of any property other than the one hundred forty one parcels of real estate and remanded for criminal forfeiture sentencing with regard to any other property. The court affirmed the judgment. He was removed from a hearing on his request to withdraw his guilty plea because he refused to cooperate. The court found that the original appeal was res judicata to all of the issues he raised or could have raised. Defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's actions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted and sentenced, and he appealed. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) evidence of the older girl's sexual conduct was properly excluded, pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The corporation sought to build subdivision, and the township's zoning regulations prohibited his actions. On review, the court affirmed. The court held that as soon as it sold the property to a buyer, the challenge to the zoning of the sold property was moot because it no longer had standing to bring an action. The court concluded that the only evidence produced at trial indicated that while the corporation retained a contingent property interest and was acting under authority granted by contract with the buyers, the corporation retained standing to maintain the suit with respect to those two of the five acres presently owned by the buyers that would have been returned to it. The court concluded that the corporation's five-acre lot size deprived the township of the reasonable use of the land. The court noted that the trial court's finding that township had met its burden of proof as to the economic nonviability of using the property as it was presently zoned. Finally, the court found that there was no legitimate governmental interest that supported the five-acre lot size requirement for land.</SPAN></P>

A county superintendent of schools notified the Bureau that the driver was suspended from school for possession or use of drugs or alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Bureau sent the driver notice that his license was being suspended under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.061 for two years based on notice from a county superintendent to the Registrar that the driver was suspended or expelled from school for using or possessing alcohol or drugs. It was undisputed that the county superintendent was not the superintendent of the driver's local schools (local superintendent). Within weeks the driver petitioned for reinstatement, claiming that he was not suspended or expelled from school for alcohol or drug use or possession, that he had not received proper notice, and that &sect; 4507.061 was unconstitutional. The Registrar filed no brief and did not appear in the appellate or trial courts, and the trial court found no error in the superintendent's notice. On review, the court found that the county school district was an entity separate from the local school district, that the county superintendent had no power to suspend or expel a local district's student, and that the local superintendent was the one to send notice to the Registrar. It held that the sending of the suspension notice by the wrong superintendent was reversible error.</SPAN></P>

The wife did not press domestic violence charges against defendant, but he was charged with disorderly conduct, a violation of Huron City, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 509.03(b)(2). The court affirmed defendant's conviction under that ordinance. Although the trial court erred in admitting otherwise privileged testimony concerning a communication and an act done by defendant to his wife under the guise of a hearsay exception, there was sufficient evidence, absent the hearsay statements, upon which to convict defendant of disorderly conduct. The admission of the testimony was harmless error. In addition, the State sufficiently proved that defendant presented a risk of physical harm to himself or another because the record showed the he was highly intoxicated with immediate access to a gun while his baby was sleeping. And, finally, the court held that &sect; 509.03(b)(2) was not vague or overbroad because a person of reasonable intelligence was capable of understanding that it proscribed the disruptive behavior of intoxicated people.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was employed as a truck driver and he was a resident of Kentucky. His employer was a Michigan resident corporation. While driving his truck from his Kentucky home to his dispatch terminal in Michigan, the claimant was injured in a traffic accident in Ohio. His claim for workers' compensation from Ohio was disallowed and he sought judicial review. The trial court ruled that, even though the claimant was not covered under the workers' compensation laws of Michigan or Kentucky, he was not entitled to Ohio benefits under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.54 because he was only temporarily within the state. The claimant appealed. In reversing, the appellate court ruled that &sect; 4123.54, which was liberally construed in favor of employees, precluded compensation only when the employee was a nonresident who was insured in another state and was only temporarily in Ohio. Although the claimant was a nonresident, &sect; 4123.54 did not apply to defeat Ohio compensation because he was foreclosed on a jurisdictional or quasi-jurisdictional basis from being &quot;insured&quot; under the workers' compensation law of another state, such as Michigan or Kentucky.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A complaint was filed against defendant that alleged that defendant marked his vehicle in a manner similar to that prescribed for county sheriffs or their deputies.

The court affirmed because defendant admitted to painting his vehicle in such a manner and two witnesses stated that the painting on defendant's car was similar to that prescribed for sheriffs' vehicles. In addition, the court determined that it was clear that there was substantial evidence which, if believed, would have supported the trier of facts' determination that defendant was guilty.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant restaurant appealed an order from the Common Pleas Court County of Summit, Ohio, which awarded a jury verdict to plaintiffs, customer and his wife, on their claims for the customer's personal injury and the loss of consortium sustained by the wife when the customer was injured by a collapsing chair in the restaurant . The restaurant appealed the trial court's decision that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.45 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.45 modified the collateral source rule and provided for post-verdict proceedings that setoff the amount of the jury award by amounts received by a plaintiff from other collateral sources. The court reversed the trial court's determination that &sect; 2317.45 violated the customer's right to have all the facts determined by the jury, and held that &sect; 2317.45 preserved the inadmissibility of evidence of collateral benefits at trial, and therefore did not invade the province of the jury in the issue of liability determination. Although &sect; 2317.45 would reduce the total amount of compensation to be received by the customer and his wife, it eliminated only the compensation that was over the amount determined by the jury. The court held that &sect; 2317.45 had not usurped the customer and his wife's right-to-remedy under the Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 15, or implicated rights of substantive due process or Equal Protection under the Ohio or U.S. Const. The theory of res ipsa loquitur was warranted because the restaurant had not produced the chair. The court deferred to the trial court's determination that slight references to the restaurant's liability insurance were harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the holding that the Ohio rule which modified the collateral source rule was unconstitutional, held that the evidence presented was insufficient to justify the award of prejudgment interest, and vacated that award. The court affirmed other parts of the determination, and remanded for proceedings for a setoff against the jury award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners filed a request for rezoning with the board of trustees for a tract of land, which was denied by the county regional planning commission. The trustees, however, allowed for an expansion of the landowners' flea market operation by enlarging the commercial area of their property and the need for additional parking by providing R-2 rezoning. It was the trustees' expectation that the landowners, pursuant to the R-2 residential zoning, could apply to the board for a conditional use permit for additional parking. Upon review, the court held that the evidence supported the trial court's finding that the trustees were attempting to meet the landowner's needs as property owners while at the same time protecting the surrounding residentially zoned areas. The court held that there was competent and credible evidence supporting the trial court's judgment that the zoning ordinance was not unreasonable, arbitrary, and confiscatory; nor was it unconstitutional because it was substantially related to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare.

Likewise, it was also uncontroverted appellant did not set forth a specific monetary sum in her original pleadings. The court found that appellant did not necessarily need to specify a monetary sum because the pleadings read in conjunction with Ohio Rev.

Defendant contended that the not-guilty verdicts on all charges that exclusively involved the direct operation of the vehicle meant that the jury could have found him guilty of aggravated vehicular homicide only on the basis of his participation in the operation of the vehicle. In turn, he contended that the trial court's erroneous instructions on participation, causation, and recklessness caused the jury to improperly find him guilty by reason of participation in the operation of the vehicle. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the fact that defendant was found not guilty of charges involving only the operation of the car did not in itself preclude the possibility that the jury found him guilty of operating the car on the charge of aggravated vehicular homicide under &sect; 2903.06.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted that there was a conspiracy to illegally purchase firearms in Ohio and transport them to New York City. He argued that there was no evidence that he was involved in the conspiracy after the enactment of the RICO statute in 1986. The court affirmed the convictions and held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for acquittal on the RICO charge. The court noted that in order to prove an incident of corrupt activity in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.32, the State was required to show that defendant engaged in, or solicited, coerced, or intimidated another person to engage in a prohibited activity as set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.31(I). The court found that the State's evidence included testimony of defendant's co-conspirator who testified that he was told to contact defendant if he, the co-conspirator, found anyone to buy guns or if he bought a gun himself. The court concluded that the evidence, along with other evidence relating to the conspiracy, could allow reasonable minds to reach different conclusions as to whether defendant was still involved in buying and selling guns after Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner brought suit against defendant city over a denial of its application to amend a commercial development plan. The trial court (Ohio) transformed the city's dismissal motion into one for summary judgment. The landowner then amended the complaint, adding a misrepresentation claim against defendant planning board members. The landowner appealed from the trial court's subsequent entry of summary judgment in favor of the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected the landowner's contention that his amended complaint rendered the summary judgment motion moot because it did not contain allege new claims against the city. The court then held that summary judgment was appropriately granted to the city. The zoning law, under which the application had been denied, was repealed, so the landowner's only remaining relief was monetary. Because the city's zoning orders involved its police and legislative powers, the city was protected by sovereign immunity and, so, was immune from monetary damage claims. In addition, a legitimate zoning did not constitute a taking of private property nor did a planning board decision act as an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to an administrative body, particularly where the alleged injury was a denial of more extensive rights that the landowner originally had. However, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the board members, because the landowner stated a viable claim for the tort of malicious interference with his constitutional right to petition the government for redress and there were questions of fact as to those parties' claims of good faith immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With respect to the landowner's misrepresentation claim against the individual board members, the court reversed the order granting summary judgment. With respect to the city, the court concluded that summary judgment was properly granted. The cause was remanded for further proceedings against the board members.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was an inmate at a state correctional institution. In his complaint, appellant alleged that the department violated his First Amendment rights and that certain prison conditions were unconstitutional.

Appellant also sought to enjoin the practice of double-celling inmates and to prevent the department from cutting his hair. In granting the motion to dismiss, the trial court specifically held that the department was not liable under &sect; 1983 for money damages. The trial court also denied appellant's request that the prison be enjoined from cutting his hair. Further, the trial court ruled that appellant's claim as to double-celling did not state a constitutional claim for relief. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal because the department was not a person within the meaning of &sect; 1983, the restriction placed upon appellant's hair length did not unconstitutionally infringe on his freedom to exercise his religious beliefs, and appellant was unable to prove any set of facts which, construed in his favor, would have entitled him to relief under the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted appellee mall supporters a preliminary injunction enjoining the referendum. When the board of elections decided not to appeal the decision, the coalition, through the attorney, filed a motion for leave to intervene and a supporting memorandum for the purpose of requesting a reconsideration. The trial court found that the motion was frivolous and awarded damages. The attorney argued that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2323.51 and Ohio R. Civ. P. 11 had no application because a legitimate legal goal was asserted that was not totally without justification under existing law. On appeal, the court vacated the sanctions because the trial court failed to make a finding that the pleading was filed for the purpose of harassing the parties or to delay the proceedings. Likewise, the motion was not frivolous because the argument was warranted under existing law, and it was within the trial court's discretion to grant or to deny the motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lodge's gambling devices and related items were confiscated by the department's investigators. The state liquor control commission suspended the lodge's liquor license, based upon its violations of Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-53 prohibiting the use of gambling devices. The department filed a petition for forfeiture. The trial court determined that the property was contraband and was forfeited. On appeal, the court affirmed. First, the court held that the liquor agents' warrantless administrative search and confiscation of the machines was proper. The investigators entered the premises through an open door, paid a cover charge, and observed patrons playing the gambling machines. The lodge's consent to the entry did not lose its status of being freely and voluntarily given merely because it would not have been given if the investigators had identified themselves as liquor control agents. The court also held that the trial court did not err in applying the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel to the issue of whether the property was contraband.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal defendant first argued that the trial court erred when it overruled his motion for a directed verdict of acquittal at the close of the State's case in chief and at the close of all the evidence. Defendant asserted that the evidence was insufficient for a conviction under &sect; 2911.11 because the evidence did not show the necessary element to support the conviction that a person was present or likely to be present in the dwelling. The court held that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to infer that the mobile home owner or her son was likely to be present at the mobile home at the time defendant committed the trespass. Defendant also contended that the evidence did not show that he had the purpose to commit a theft offense. The court noted that it was not necessary that any property be actually stolen in order to constitute a burglary. An intent to steal was the only element of larceny necessary to a charge of burglary. Given the nature of the force used in the breaking and entering the court concluded that there was sufficient credible evidence for which the jury may have found purpose and intent.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(A). The employee claimed that she was denied equal protection by application of the limitations period contained in &sect; 4121.80(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured on the job when she tripped over an electrical cover that was concealed by soap suds and water that had accumulated on the floor in her work area. The employee claimed that the employer was aware of the dangerous condition and required her to work in the area. The trial court granted the employer's motion to dismiss because the employee had failed to file her claim within one year from the date of her injury as required by &sect; 4121.80(A) after considering Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.47, which raised a presumption that all statutes were constitutional. On appeal, the court held that the presumption raised by &sect; 1.47 was rebuttable and, in this case, the statute at issue, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(A), violated the employee's equal protection rights because its limitation period was shorter than the limitations period for common law intentional torts. The court reasoned that the prompt determination of whether the employee had asserted an intentional tort claim against the employer was not a justifiable reason for distinguishing between employment related and non-employment related intentional tort causes of action in setting statute of limitation periods.</SPAN></P>

The statute was found to have been an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power and to have been unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the State contended that the trial court erred in declaring Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.46(A)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the issue presented by the State was whether &sect; 2913.46(A) was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power or authority. The court held that Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 1 declared that the legislative power of Ohio was vested in a general assembly, and the general assembly could not abdicate or transfer to others the essential legislative functions with which it was vested. The court reasoned that the statute in question did nothing more than provide a penalty for the violation of the federal act within the confines of the State of Ohio. The court concluded that Congress had the power to repeal the Ohio statute by simply repealing the federal act, or to change any element of the Ohio crime. The court held that because the Ohio General Assembly was without any means for review, modification, or amendment of the federal act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.46(A) was clearly in direct conflict with Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 1. Therefore, the court held that the statute was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A few weeks after a police officer was shot, a witness in a bar overheard defendant and co-defendant bragging about shooting the officer.

Defendant contended that he was told by the police to either hand over his jacket for a search or the police planned to take him to the police station for a search. The officers testified that defendant consented to a search and threw his jacket at an officer. When defendant's jacket was searched, officers found a packet of &quot;rolling papers&quot; along with a bag of marijuana. Thereafter, defendant was charged with drug violations, but was never charged with shooting the officer. The court found that there were sufficient articulable facts to give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct such that the police lawfully approached and detained defendant in order to question him concerning the shooting. The court further held that defendant's jacket was searched by virtue of his consent and that such consent was given voluntarily.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of three judgments of the trial court (Ohio) in which the trial court held that Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 2903.21 by reason of the race and/or color of the victims in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2927.12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State consolidated three separate cases based on the fact that all three cases involve the same issue, whether Ohio Rev.

The trial court granted each defendant's motion to dismiss, finding that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The State appealed, and the court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court held that &sect; 2927.12 was void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the statute itself did not give a person of ordinary intelligence fair warning as to what conduct was prohibited. The statute stated that no person shall violate any one of the enumerated sections by reason of the race, color, religion, or national origin of another person or group of persons. However, the statute did not indicate upon whose sensitivity a violation must depend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A murder investigation led to defendant, who was at a hotel. When police arrived, he tried to flee, but was apprehended and arrested. At the police station, he spoke with a civil attorney who advised him to hire a criminal attorney. He gave a statement to police two days later. Six days later, he was indicted by a grand jury. Prior to trial, the prosecutor sought to amend the indictment to drop a murder for hire allegation. The court held that defendant's statements to police were not subject to suppression because they were not made without the presence of counsel after defense counsel had been retained. Defendant had spoken with a civil attorney, but had not retained him, nor a criminal attorney, prior to voluntarily speaking with police. Defendant's warrantless arrest was also proper because exigent circumstances existed in that he was fleeing. Defendant's detention for 48 hours without being charged was not a denial of due process. Finally, the trial court's allowance of the State's amendment to the indictment was proper because the amendment did not change the name or the identity of the charged offense and defendant was neither mislead nor prejudiced by the amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim received a note that demanded she place her money in a bag and leave it in her yard or she would be killed. The victim did not comply with the demand. The victim's body was discovered in her home. An autopsy revealed that the cause of her death was a single knife cut to her throat that severed all major arteries and the esophagus. A jury convicted defendant of aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, extortion, and aggravated murder of a victim with two specifications. In a penalty phase, the jury recommended imposition of the sentence of death and the trial court adopted the jury's recommendation. The court held that: (1) statements made by defendant on the evening of his arrest and while he was incarcerated prior to trial were not made in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and their suppression was not required; (2) defendant's constitutional rights were not violated by the State's use of peremptory challenges that removed two jurors because of their positions on the death penalty and removed a third juror due to general indecisiveness; and (3) it was not error for the trial court to give a cautionary instruction on defendant's unsworn statement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife appealed an arbitrator's award in their negligence and loss of consortium action against the tortfeasor. A jury awarded the husband and wife less than the arbitrator had. Pursuant to Rule 2.53(Z), the tortfeasor moved for attorney's fees and costs. The trial court awarded the tortfeasor costs but not attorney's fees. On appeal, the husband and wife argued that Rule 2.53(Z) was unconstitutional. The tortfeasor argued that the trial court erred in denying attorney fees. The court found that Rule 2.53(Z), as applied, contravened Ohio R. Civ. P. 54(D) and was thus unconstitutional.&nbsp;Ohio R. Civ. P. 54(D) did allow for the tortfeasor to recover costs. To the extent that Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County, Ohio C.P. Gen. Div. R 2.53(Z) allowed for the award of attorney's fees in addition to costs, it contradicted Ohio R. Civ. P. 54(D), which spoke only of costs, and therefore could not stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife filed a filing a motion to amerce the sheriff for a $ 6,350 judgment upon which he failed to execute against her former husband pursuant to the property settlement of their divorce judgment. The trial court dismissed the amercement motion pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 41. On appeal, the court reversed the dismissal on the basis that the wife had established a prima facie case for amercement and remanded. At a hearing on remand, the sheriff testified that he did not believe he could legally proceed with the sale of the husband's vehicles until the trial court had ruled upon his claimed exemption. The trial court overruled the wife's motion to amerce the sheriff, stating that it could not say that he acted unreasonably in failing to execute the writ under all the circumstances. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the wife made a clear case in amercement and that judgment should be entered in her favor as a matter of law. Although it was highly unlikely that the wife would have recovered anything from the judicial sale of the husband's vehicles, that factor was irrelevant and was an insufficient defense to her amercement action against the sheriff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant putative father challenged a judgment of the Huron County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division (Ohio), which denied the father's demand for a jury trial in a parentage action filed by plaintiff mother. Defendant argued that the trial court committed prejudicial error and abused its discretion by denying his demand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the trial court erred in striking his jury demand because he tendered the required deposit in substantial compliance with a local procedural rule. On appeal, the court agreed. The local rule stated that in all paternity actions, either party could request a jury trial pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.15 by tendering an advance deposit of $ 125 or by making the deposit within 10 days of filing the demand. The rule further provided that failure to tender the deposit constituted a waiver of the right to a jury trial. The record established that although the father failed to pay the deposit in accordance with the rule, the trial court entered an order allowing the demand after the 10-day period within which the deposit had to be made had expired. Accordingly, the court concluded that although the father's deposit was paid well beyond the 10-day time limit, the trial court's order granting the demand after that period expired and its application of the money to court costs precluded a finding that the father waived his right to a jury trial. Thus, the trial court abused its discretion in striking the father's demand.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant failed to do so, and the trial court's proceedings were presumed to be correct. The court held that defendant was present in the trial court and was fully advised of his constitutional rights. He was also present when his counsel requested a drug dependency evaluation and was afforded an opportunity to address the issues of his drug dependency at length.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress certain evidence because, he claimed, the evidence was obtained as the result of an unconstitutional search and seizure. The court ruled that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the guns as there was competent, credible evidence both that defendant consented to a search of his home and that the handgun was voluntarily produced during the consensual search. Moreover there was competent credible evidence that another handgun was discovered in plain view. And although other seized objects were not specifically described in the search warrant, they nonetheless had a sufficient nexus to the drug trafficking crimes being investigated. However, the court found that defendant's conviction for trafficking in marijuana had to be reversed because his confrontation right was violated. The confidential informant was the sole witness to the alleged offense and the informant became the state's witness to his offense at trial, yet never actually appeared at trial or became subject to cross-examination by the defense.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also alleged that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court held that where the record was silent it was required to assume that the trial court considered the factors contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.22 prior to sentencing. The trial court's alleged violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2937.21 by not granting defendant's motion to discharge applied only to discharge from custody and bail and did not provide grounds for reversal of a conviction on appeal. The trial court complied with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2937.07 when it relied upon an affidavit in rendering its verdict upon defendant's no contest plea.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Wadsworth Municipal Court, Medina County (Ohio) convicting him of operating a car with a prohibited concentration of alcohol. Defendant originally entered a plea of not guilty and filed an unsuccessful motion to dismiss, challenging the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3). Defendant next filed an unsuccessful motion for discharge under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2937.21.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's motion for discharge was overruled he filed a withdrawal of his jury demand and a notice of intent to change his plea. On the day before trial, he submitted his second written waiver of a jury trial. At trial, defendant changed his plea to no contest. On appeal, defendant claimed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was applied in a discriminatory manner, was discriminatory in its application, and contravened U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Defendant, a male, challenged the constitutionality of the statute on the ground that it was discriminatorily applied against women. Affirming, the court held that he could not challenge the constitutionality of the statute, as he was not an injured member of the class against whom the statute was alleged to have been unconstitutionally applied. Further, the Ohio appellate courts had upheld the constitutionality of the statute. Defendant also argued that he was not guilty of violating the statute because the Uniform Traffic ticket read that he had an alcohol concentration of &quot;.233/100 grams&quot; per 210 liters of breath. The court held that an obvious scrivener's error did not warrant the reversal of the valid conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and ordered that a special mandate issue out of the court, directing the trial court to carry the court's judgment into execution. Costs were taxed to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. An appeal was taken. The court held that the trial court erred in granting the motion. Viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the non-moving party, the placement service, a question of fact remained as to whether the performance of the alleged agreement between the placement service, and the manufacturer was interstate commerce--whether the placement service was &quot;doing business&quot; within Ohio so as to fall under the licensing requirements of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4143.02. There was no question that the placement service was a corporation engaged in the business of a personnel placement service and that the placement service was not licensed as a private placement service by Ohio. If the placement service was doing business in Ohio, it fell under the guidelines of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4143.01 and could not sue in Ohio. However, if the placement service, as a foreign corporation, was not doing business within the state, but was engaged solely in interstate commerce, the Ohio statute could not burden such interstate activity by requiring the personnel service to be licensed in the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision, which granted the motion of the paint manufacturer for summary judgment in an action for breach of contract and quantum meruit brought by the Wisconsin personnel placement service, and remanded the matter for a trial.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the parents had been offered services to help them take care of themselves in order that they might subsequently take care of their child. They both failed at the programs designed to help them due to a lack of motivation or interest in the programs. It would have been futile to offer the parents special services to take care of the child when they failed at programs designed to teach them to take care of themselves. Under the Equal Protection Clause of the fourteenth Amendment, the mentally retarded were not a suspect or quasi-suspect class. The parents were not treated differently than other parents when considering termination of parental rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a guardian of an incompetent person, sought review of a judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division (Ohio), which removed the guardian as a non-resident, but did not remove appellee co-guardian, who was also a non-resident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guardian and the co-guardian were first cousins of the incompetent person. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2109.21(C) required all guardians to be Ohio residents. After the guardian was removed and replaced by an Ohio attorney, the guardian appealed. Vacating the failure to remove the co-guardian, the court said that the trial court erred in retaining the co-guardian and might have lacked the jurisdiction to appoint the attorney as the other co-guardian. The probate court might have lacked the statutorily defined jurisdiction to appoint any guardian under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2111.02. The record did not show whether the incompetent person resided in the county at the time. Affirming the guardian's removal, the court said that in her consent, the incompetent selected persons who were, by their admission in their applications, nonresidents. No matter how suitable they might have been for the appointment as co-guardians, the probate court's authority to appoint them as such was precluded by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2109.21. When the probate court exceeded that authority and appointed them as guardians, that appointment was voidable from the outset.</SPAN></P>

If jurisdiction was found, the trial court had to appoint a guardian. If not, the trial court had to transfer the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state contended that decedent was a battered child who died from a traumatic blow to his head. Defendant maintained that she had never abused him. Defendant argued that the trial court committed numerous errors, that the state denied her complete discovery, and that she was denied effective assistance of counsel. The court found no prejudicial errors. Defendant was properly indicted for involuntary manslaughter under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.14 because the indictment charged her with causing the death of a specified individual on a specific date as a proximate result of committing or attempting to commit a felony. Under &sect; 2919.22, defendant, who was at least acting as a babysitter, had a statutory duty of care to decedent. The court rejected defendant's argument that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. Defendant was not entitled to an acquittal because the evidence was circumstantial. Decedent's statements to his mother and a social worker were properly admitted to show identity and intent. Although defendant was entitled to records regarding suspected abuse of decedent, the court concluded that the state's failure to provide all the records was not prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

The wife filed a petition seeking protection of dower rights she claimed in the property, which had been acquired after her marriage. The trial court found the wife entitled to no relief under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.32(E)(4).

She received a transfusion of her own blood during the procedure and then received donor blood that had not been tested for HIV.

She filed a malpractice and negligence action against the hospital and the trial court rendered a verdict in favor of the patient. The hospital sought review. The court affirmed. It found that the jury instructions included all of the applicable law necessary to decide the case and were sufficient to lead the jury. The court further found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.43, which limited medical claims to $ 200,000 violated equal protection of rights under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2, and U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was alleged to have deprived his twin daughters of food and water until they died. Although the jury acquitted defendant of murder charges, he was convicted and sentenced for two counts of involuntary manslaughter and two counts of child endangerment. Defendant alleged that the convictions violated his right to be free from double jeopardy because he was being punished twice for the same conduct. The court affirmed the convictions and found that they did not violate defendant's rights under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and U.S. Const. amend. V. The court found that under Ohio's multiple-counts statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25, a defendant could be convicted for two offenses even if the act for the offenses was the same if the offenses (1) were not allied and of similar import, (2) were committed separately, or (2) were committed with separate animus as to each offense. The court then found that manslaughter and child endangerment were not allied offenses with similar import because the act of child endangerment did not necessary result in an act of involuntary manslaughter and the act of involuntary manslaughter would not necessarily result in child endangerment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant threatened the victim with a shotgun and chased him around a car. Defendant fired a shot that narrowly missed the victim. Defendant was arrested and charged with attempted aggravated murder. At the close of the evidence, the trial court dismissed the attempted aggravated murder charge and instructed the jury on attempted murder. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's assertion that the indictment was insufficient because he had the opportunity to request a bill of particulars. Defendant's asserted errors on the admission of evidence were waived for his failure to object at trial. Defendant asserted that there was a plain error in the admission of evidence of his post-Miranda silence. The court held that the reference to defendant's silence was an isolated incident that was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of his guilt. Defendant's due process rights were not prejudiced by the trial court's change to the charge because the trial court did not amend the indictment and the elements of attempted murder were included in the charge of attempted aggravated murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Akron Municipal Court of the County of Summit (Ohio), which found him guilty of peeling his car tires, a violation of Akron, Ohio, City Code &sect; 73.12, and of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), a violation of Akron, Ohio, City Code &sect; 73.01(A)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed and heard defendant peel the tires of his car by rapidly accelerating from a stopped position. The officer made an investigative stop of defendant's car. After observing defendant's physical behavior, the officer cited defendant for DUI under &sect; 73.01(A)(1) and peeling his car tires under Akron, Ohio, City Code &sect; 73.12. The trial court found him guilty as charged. The court noted that driving a car was subject to reasonable regulation under the police power of the State of Ohio in the interest of public safety. Further, &sect; 73.12, as applied to defendant, was constitutionally valid. Moreover, the State had not spoken with regard to the legality of peeling. Thus, &sect; 73.12 was not in conflict with the Ohio Revised Code Annotated, as it did not prohibit what the State positively permitted. Additionally, as Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.07 was not an exhaustive list of the subjects which a municipality could regulate, Akron, Ohio, City Code &sect; 73.12 was a valid exercise of police power regulating local traffic operation. Finally, whether or not &sect; 73.12 was constitutionally valid, defendant's conduct provided reasonable suspicion to allow an investigatory stop.</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed the decision of the board. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) the trial court did not err in finding that &sect; 1807 was constitutional because the ordinance did not prevent any person from parking a trailer on his or her property, but rather provided that a trailer could be parked in a driveway at a residence as long as it was no more than 30 feet in length; additionally, the ordinance was neither vague nor unevenly regulated or enforced; and (2) the trial court did not err in finding that no unnecessary hardship resulted from a literal enforcement of &sect; 1807 against the property owner because the record indicated the property owner failed to demonstrate any unnecessary hardship unique to his own property in order to be granted such a variance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of his injury, the employee had been making a delivery while working in his position as a truck driver for the employer. The employee was injured when attempting to take the truck's back tailgates off, which were jammed. Several eyewitnesses testified that immediately after his fall, the employee was observed hunched over on the ground crying and saying that he had been hurt. Because there was sufficient evidence in the record from which reasonable minds could reach a different conclusion on whether the injury was an accident, the employer's motion for a directed verdict was properly denied. Finding no error in the remarks by counsel that were challenged by the employer, the court upheld the judgment for the employee. The court also upheld the decision to exclude the testimony of a medical witness for the employee on the motion of the employer, as well as the finding with respect to the jurisdictional challenge. However, the court reversed with respect to the denial of the request to tax all costs, noting that the judge who had overruled the motion had no authority to do so once the case had been reassigned for trial to a visiting judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city employee claimed that he was entitled to accumulated unused vacation time, pursuant to Youngstown, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 163.19. The ordinance provided that the carryover required the department head's approval. In 1985, the ordinance was amended to provide that a municipal employee's carryover of any vacation benefits had to be used within a specific period of time. From 1975 until 1982, the city employee requested and was granted a carryover. After 1982, further carryover of the city employee's vacation time was not approved by his department head. The common pleas court granted summary judgment for the city employee in his action for the accumulated unused vacation time. Reversing and remanding, the court held that &sect; 163.19, prior to amendment, did not grant the city employee a vested right to carryover his unused vacation accrual but provided that the carryover of unused vacation was conditioned on the express written permission of the department head. The refusal of the department head in 1982 to give permission to the city employee to carryover his unused vacation accrual ended the city employee's ability to carryover his unused vacation time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipal employee was employed by the city in various positions within the law department over a number of years. Prior to its amendment in 1985, Youngstown, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 163.19 permitted the carryover of accumulated unused vacation time where approved by the department head. Section 163.19 was amended in 1985 and prohibited the carryover of unused vacation time by those not included in a bargaining unit and designated as management, which included the municipal employee. The municipal employee did not use his vacation hours as required and filed a complaint. The common pleas court granted summary judgment for the municipal employee. Reversing and remanding, the court held that the municipal employee had no vested contractual rights in the unused vacation hours and that the amendment did not retroactively impair his alleged vested right. The municipal employee's failure to obtain permission from his department head for the carryover prohibited him from accruing any unused vacation time prior to the 1985 amendment.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 3767.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county sheriff's office investigated the bookstore related to an obscenity case, but the focus shifted when the sheriff's office came across evidence that sexual activity was taking place in the arcade portions of the bookstore. A complaint was filed alleging that the bookstore was a public nuisance pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.01 et seq. The court granted a temporary injunction closing the bookstore until rendition of the final judgment. In its final judgment, the trial court found conclusive evidence that lewdness or assignation was conducted on the premises, permanently enjoined the conduct, and closed the bookstore for one year. On appeal, the owners contended that the term lewdness as used in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.01(C) was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that (1) the term was sufficiently precise to afford reasonable notice of the conduct prohibited and avoid arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement, (2) the owner's free speech was not violated, and (3) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.06 allowed the State to close the entire building and not just the arcade because the bookstore was operated as a single entity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of a court of common pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of aggravated murder, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01(B), with a death penalty specification, kidnapping, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.01, and aggravated robbery, all with firearm specifications.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after the victim's body was found near defendant's home, and the gun used to kill the victim was found in defendant's home. On appeal, the court reversed the death sentence on the ground of prejudicial error. Defendant was prejudiced by prosecutorial misconduct as the prosecutor improperly (1) argued non-statutory aggravating circumstances to the jury, causing the jury to conclude that the aggravating circumstances were the abhorrent nature of the crimes themselves, and (2) gave a victim impact statement, which was inadmissible because it bore no relation to the personal responsibility and moral guilt of defendant and was not related directly to the circumstances of the crimes. Defendant was also prejudiced in that the trial judge failed to define &quot;aggravated circumstances&quot; and instructed the jury to weigh the aggravated circumstances it had already found against mitigating factors. Also, defense counsel was ineffective as he failed to object to a victim impact statement and improper jury instructions. Finally, defendant was prejudiced by the trial court's failure to identify aggravating or mitigating circumstances pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.03.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of conviction and sentence entered by the Scioto County Court of Common Pleas, (Ohio) upon a jury verdict, finding her guilty of the offense of promoting prostitution in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.22(A)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant befriended a 16-year-old girl and arranged for her to perform sex acts for money. Defendant was arrested and convicted of promoting prostitution in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.22(A)(2). Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. As to defendant's claim that &sect; 2907.22(A)(2) was unconstitutionally vague, the court held that a constitutional claim of error could be raised for the first time on appeal only where application of the plain error rule was required to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice. The court held that there was no manifest miscarriage of justice in this case so defendant waived this issue since she brought it up for the first time on appeal. The court found that defendant's rights were not violated when she gave a statement to police without Miranda warnings because she was not in custody or under arrest at the time she made the statements and therefore Miranda did not apply. It was not error for the trial court to not allow a witness to testify because his testimony would not have been helpful to defendant, was cumulative, and was only offered as specific instances of bad conduct to impeach the witness in violation of Ohio R. Evid. 608(B).</SPAN></P>
