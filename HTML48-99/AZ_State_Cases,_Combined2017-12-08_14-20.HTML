The trial court denied the corporation's motion for summary judgment and granted the city's motion to dismiss. The corporation appealed. The corporation was not a public service corporation within the meaning of Ariz. Const. art. 15, &sect; 2 because refuse disposal was not among the services or products described in that section. The corporation was not a public utility service pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-516.A. That term did not include all business affected with the public interest. The corporation was not a political subdivision of the state. It did not offer the type of service or product provided by public service corporations, nor would competition lead to abuses detrimental to the public interest. The city was not required to purchase or condemn the corporation's property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher was indicted on several counts of sexual conduct with a minor, one count of sexual abuse, and one count of child molestation. Real party in interest governing board of the school district sent the teacher a notice of their intention to dismiss him. It then denied the teacher's request that the dismissal hearing be stayed pending resolution of the criminal charges. Upon filing his petition for special action, the trial court held that the was no abuse of discretion on part of the board and that the teacher had no enforceable right, warranting injunctive relief. On appeal, the court found no error and denied the teacher's relief. The board argued that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-549 vested it with the discretion to place a teacher on paid leave pending resolution of a criminal case but did not require that it did so. The teacher argued that his Fifth Amendment privilege entitled him to a stay of the dismissal hearing pending resolution of the criminal case. The court held here there was no penalty if the teacher invoked the Fifth Amendment because of the board's assurances that his silence during the administrative investigation or hearing was not going to be held against him.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that Tucson, Ariz., Ordinance &sect; 11-25.1 did not violate the state and federal guarantees of equal protection under the law because it prohibited females, but not males, from exposing the nipple and areola regions of their breasts. As both courts below held, given the community standard for &quot;decency&quot; expressed by the community's legislatures both local and statewide, the ordinance was substantially related to an important governmental interest in regulating the public decency and order. As applied to female nightclub entertainers and servers, the additional clothing requirement of &sect; 11-25.1 was narrowly drawn and not unduly burdensome that mandated only that females cover the nipple and areola portions of their breasts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed an order of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which dismissed a theft by extortion charge against defendant on the ground that Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-1804(A)(6), under which defendant was indicted, was unconstitutionally overbroad because it encompassed a substantial amount of protected speech. The state argued that &sect; 13-1804(A)(6) was a valid enactment that prohibited &quot;blackmail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant wrote a letter to his landlord threatening that defendant was going to take certain action, such as sending press releases to the media regarding the landlord's alleged criminal activities, unless the landlord refunded defendant's security deposit, defendant was indicted for theft by extortion. The trial court dismissed the charge on the ground that &sect; 13-1804(A)(6) was unconstitutionally overbroad. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that &sect; 13-1804(A)(6), which made criminal not only protected political threats, but also threats common in everyday business and personal interactions, was unconstitutionally overbroad because it criminalized expression protected by the First Amendment. The court refused to encroach upon the legislature's power to determine what acts constituted crimes. The court held that reading a requirement of a &quot;wrongful&quot; threat into &sect; 13-1804(A)(6) would not have saved the statute because adding the term &quot;wrongful,&quot; which would not have informed the public what conduct was prohibited, would have made the statute void for vagueness. Thus, the court held that &sect; 13-1804(A)(6) encompassed a substantial amount of protected speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual argued that his prior felony convictions could not have been used to enhance his sentence because neither conviction fit within the plain meaning of Ariz.

The court accepted jurisdiction and granted the relief requested. The court held that &sect; 13-604(U)(1)(a) applied to prior felony convictions that mandated a term of imprisonment and that fell within one of the listed categories. Because the individual's previous felony convictions did not fall within any of the statutory categories, the convictions could not have been used for enhancement. The court also held that the individual's prior convictions were erroneously held to have been repetitive offenses with one prior felony conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employers operated under a contract by which the temporary services employer furnished employees to work at the special employer's premises. The employee knew that he was an employee of the temporary services employer rather than the special employer. The employee suffered permanent injury while working at a cable stripping machine on the special employer's premises. The employee filed an action in tort against the manufacturer and distributor of the machine and added the special employer as a defendant, alleging that the special employer was negligent in making changes or modifications to the cable stripping machine, in failing to properly train the employee on the operation of the machine, and in failing to warn of the dangers of the machine. The court held that the true nature of the relationship of the parties was that of employer and employee; therefore, the special employer enjoyed the immunity from tort liability afforded to employers under Arizona law. Further, the court held that the employee was not entitled to bring a third-party claim under the contract, and that certain provisions of the workers' compensation act as applied to him were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the judgment was correct under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 33-1131, 12-1598.10. Although &sect; 33-1131 limited the percentage of earnings that could be garnished and &sect; 12-1598.10 lowered that percentage more in cases of hardship, monies deposited in a bank ceased to be &quot;earnings&quot; when they were paid by the employer pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-15098.01(A), 12-1570(6). These monies were subject to garnishment under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1570.01(A)2. Although the debtor argued that this interpretation of earnings eviscerated the earnings protection of &sect;&sect; 33-1131, 12-1598.10, the court held the clear language of the statutes, the legislative history, and analogous federal law all illustrated that the earnings protections did not extend to earned monies disbursed to the debtor's bank account.</SPAN></P>

The superior court granted defendant's attorney permission to withdraw prior to the disposition of defendant's petition for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of theft and was sentenced to an aggravated term of 10 years in prison. Defendant sought post-conviction relief under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32, contending that the sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The trial court denied defendant's petition finding that no material issue of fact or law existed to grant relief. Defendant then filed a motion for appeal of the sentence, which the trial court treated as a petition for review. In addition, defendant's attorney filed and was granted a petition for withdrawal form the case. Subsequently, defendant filed a pro per petition for review. On review, the court ruled that defendant's sentence was not cruel and unusual punishment because he had 19 prior convictions, which justified the aggravated 10 year term. However, the court concluded that defendant's case had to be remanded to the trial court because he was denied the constitutional and fundamental right to counsel during his appeal as the result of his attorney being permitted to withdraw prior to a final disposition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for one count of child molestation under Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-604.01 from the Superior Court of Apache County (Arizona), arguing, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying his challenges to the composition of the jury pool and jury panel on the basis that they violated the U.S. Const. amend. VI.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for child molestation, concluding that he failed to establish a prima facie violation of his right to a jury representing a fair cross-section of the community as required by the Sixth Amendment. The conclusion that Native Americans were a distinctive group within the county and were underrepresented on the jury panel was not dispositive because the underrepresentation was not the product of systematic exclusion. Defendant failed to support his argument that Native Americans were underrepresented on the master jury list because they registered to vote at a lower rate than other county residents do. Further, the trial court's conclusion that granting excuses based on an inability to understand English was easily supported because, although it was an inappropriate basis for qualification for jury service, it was an appropriate ground to be excused from service. Further, the excusing of reservation residents on the basis of transportation difficulties was not systematic. The criterion was implicitly authorized by statute as an excuse for hardship, was facially neutral, and, was applied sparingly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accident in which the child was injured occurred when her parents' car was struck head-on by an intoxicated driver.

Stat. &sect; 4-312, upon which the trial court had instructed the jury, was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Section 4-312 restricted the jury's consideration of the evidence to a determination of whether the driver was so impaired by alcohol as to visibly affect her ability to function, such that a reasonable person would infer that she was intoxicated. The court held that under Ariz. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 6, legislation could not abrogate a right of action for injuries. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4-312 abrogated such a right by preventing the jury from considering other evidence from which intoxication could have been inferred under common law as it existed prior to the enactment of &sect; 4-312.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, partnership, corporation, and others, filed an action against defendant law partnership, alleging that an attorney with the law partnership acted negligently and breached its contractual and fiduciary duties to them in an unrelated litigation. The Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) rendered judgment in favor of the partnership, and both the law partnership and the partnership appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the law partnership argued, inter alia, that it could not have been liable for punitive damages because it was a wholly passive employer. The court held that &sect; 13 of the Uniform Partnership Act, codified at Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-213 (1989), imposed vicarious liability on partners for damages that were punitive in nature. Thus, the law partnership was vicariously liable in punitive damages for acts of the attorney that were performed in the ordinary course of the partnership's business. The court further held that there was substantial evidence that the law partnership proximately caused the partnership to sustain actual damages in the unrelated litigation and that the jury could have reasonably concluded that but for the law partnership's legal malpractice, the partnership could have could have significantly reduced its liability in the litigation. Moreover, the award satisfied the predicate requirement for an award of punitive damages because the jury's finding that the attorney acted with an evil mind was reasonably supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for compensatory and punitive damages against the law partnership but reversed part of the trial court's award of credit for partial satisfaction against the judgment. The court remanded the matter to the trial court for entry of judgment in accordance with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

Appellees, Arizona Department of Revenue, county, and county tax officials, filed a cross-appeal from a portion of the tax court's opinion that found the amending act of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-506 was unconstitutional to the extent it retroactively amended the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers owned a portion of agricultural land as to which a subdivision plat had been recorded splitting the property into small parcels. The land was never developed and was continually farmed. The tax assessor assessed the taxpayers' land as vacant residential subdivision lots, following the policy that a parcel could not quality as agricultural land unless it contained a minimum of 20 acres. The taxpayers sought a declaration that their parcels had been erroneously assessed as nonagricultural property and a refund of overpayments of taxes made on the nonagricultural assessments. The tax court held that the taxpayers had no claim for relief under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-506, and that amendments to the statute could not be retroactively applied. On appeal, the court affirmed. The valuation decision that resulted in individual nonagricultural valuation for all the taxpayers' lots despite their combined use as a farming operation was not an erroneous assessment for which relief could be granted under the statute. Relief was available under the statute only for assessment errors that were clear and indisputable without the need for resolution of contested issues of fact or law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the taxpayer's action for a partial refund of taxes and did not reach the issue of whether the retroactive amendment of the tax law was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee developers petitioned the Arizona Supreme Court to grant review the decision of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), and the state supreme court remanded to the court to review the claims in light of a United States Supreme Court decision. The underlying cause regarded the charge of development fees by defendant city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court was required to consider whether the newly decided case had any effect on its prior opinion. In analyzing the effect of that case the court first considered whether the fees charged by the city implicated the power of eminent domain. If the fees constituted a land-use regulation, eminent domain would have been implicated. If the fees were a tax, however, they would not have been subject to the Takings Clause. The court found that the payment of the fee was a condition to the city's issuance of a building permit and the fee was for the express purpose of providing future water to the subject property. Thus, the fee was to be used to benefit the property on which the fee was imposed, rather than for general revenue and was a regulatory fee rather than a tax. Because the development fee ordinance was more akin to a land-use regulation than a tax, it was subject to the Takings Clause. Because the city's development fees involved a legislative, rather than adjudicative, determination, the court concluded that the new case did not control the outcome of the case and did not affect its prior opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld its prior decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) of solicitation to possess narcotic drugs. Defendant appealed form his conviction and sentence, contending that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of two lumps of &quot;crack&quot; cocaine found as a result of a pat-down search and in failing to consider his inability to pay a probation services fee pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-901(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err. Defendant testified that he approached the officer. The officer testified defendant was free to leave. The voluntary, consensual encounter with the officer did not implicate Fourth Amendment safeguards. The first prong of the plain feel test was satisfied because a pat down search of defendant was justified, as the officer was aware that many people in the high crime area carried small knifes in their pockets. Thus, the officer was lawfully positioned to feel the crack cocaine. The second prong was satisfied because due to his experience and training, the two asymmetrical lumps were immediately recognizable by the officer as crack cocaine. The third prong was satisfied because the pat-down search ended as soon as the officer recognized the crack cocaine. At that point defendant was arrested and the subsequent search of defendant's pocket was a search incident to a lawful arrest. Thus, suppression of the crack cocaine was not warranted. Defendant's failure to object to the imposition of the probation fee at trial was fatal to that claim on appeal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that: (1) there was substantial evidence in the form of expert testimony and documentary evidence that defendant's children were likely to die or to be seriously injured as a result of the carbon monoxide levels and concomitant oxygen depletion in the garage; (2) the failure to object to evidence of prior bad acts at the time of trial waived the assertion and failed to preserve the claim for appellate review; (3) defendant's objection to the introduction of lay opinion testimony was foreclosed when defendant had first introduced the lay opinion testimony; and (4) defendant's failure to object to the prosecutor's closing argument waived the assertion on appeal. The court held that the imposition of two consecutive 17-year sentences was not unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were carrying guns inside fanny packs that were designed specially to carry concealed weapons. The court found that Ariz. Const. art.

The court found that although Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3102 might limit the right to bear arms, it neither frustrated nor impaired it. The court concluded that &sect; 13-3102 was constitutional. The court found that the legislature intended to prohibit a person from carrying a concealed weapon on his or her person in a manner readily accessible for immediate use unless the conveyance utilized to carry the weapon reasonably would place others on notice that such person was armed. The court found that fanny packs did not give such notice, such as a conspicuously carried holster or scabbard. The court affirmed and concluded that a &quot;fanny pack&quot; was not a &quot;case&quot; for purposes of &sect; 13-3102(F), which exempted application of &sect; 13-3102(A)(1).</SPAN></P>

The mother attacked the constitutionality of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-218(B) (1991), and the trial court agreed. The father filed a petition for special action. The court accepted jurisdiction and denied the father's requested relief, finding that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States and Arizona Constitutions. A parent's right to the custody of a child was a fundamental interest; therefore, although a gender-based distinction was at issue, the statute was tested against a strict scrutiny analysis. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-218(C) allowed a man to rebut the presumption of legal paternity but did not provide the same opportunity for a woman.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-3553(A)(1) (1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction on a charge of the sexual exploitation of a minor in violation of &sect; 13-3553(A)(1). The charge, which was based on three home videotapes, required proof that appellant made a film in which minors were engaged in sexual conduct. The relevant statutory definition of sexual conduct under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;13-3553(2)(f) meant the lewd exhibition of the genitals, pubic, or rectal areas of any person. The court reversed and remanded with directions to enter a judgment of acquittal. The court concluded that none of the minors in appellant's videotapes were engaged in sexaul conduct within the meaning of Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-3553. Two of the tapes showed the normal, nonsexual conduct of children changing clothes or taking a shower in what they thought was a private setting. The third tape frequently focused on the genitals and pubic areas of minors, but the photographic images used as material for the third tape depicted children engaged in normal, nonsexual conduct that was appropriate for the age and activity being photographed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff surviving parents appealed an order from the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant power company on the negligence claims in the wrongful death action, dismissed the strict liability claim against defendant aircraft corporation, and entered judgments on the jury verdicts in favor of aircraft corporation and defendant manufacturer on negligence and products liability claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an initial matter, the court held that power company was entitled to summary judgment, finding that although it owed a duty of care to the decedents, its failure to marks its power lines did not create an unreasonable risk of harm to normally operating aircraft and thus its conduct was not actionable negligence. The court further found that because surviving parents failed to produce evidence from which reasonable people could have concluded that manufacturer's engine was defective, the trial judge should have granted a directed verdict for manufacturer on the duty to warn claim. In addition, the court then held that the trial judge committed reversible error in admitting the National Transportation Safety Board's probable cause conclusion. The court concluded by finding that because of recent developments in caselaw that held Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-551&nbsp;unconstitutional, the trial judge had erred by dismissing the strict liability claim against aircraft corporation and such a claim was thus still viable against that party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the court affirmed the judgment in favor of manufacturer, as well as the summary judgment in favor of power company, it reversed the judgments in favor of aircraft corporation and remanded those matters for a new trial on surviving parents' strict liability, negligence, and products liability claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers claimed that the state's scheme for income taxation of mandatory contributions to federal, state, and local governmental retirement plans violated the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity codified in 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111. The trial court granted the taxpayers partial declaratory relief, denied their claims for refunds and injunctive relief, and held that the Arizona Department of Revenue's director and assistant director enjoyed qualified immunity on the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim for damages. On appeal, the court held that the taxpayers, who were subjected to discriminatory taxation, had an enforceable right under &sect; 1983; that their failure to exhaust administrative remedies barred their refund claims, but not their &sect; 1983 claims for damages and injunctive relief; that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 43-1001(2) and 43-1022(2) were unconstitutional; and that the director and the assistant director were entitled to qualified immunity. The court also held that, in light of its holding that &sect; 43-1001(2) was unconstitutional, the request for injunctive relief required further consideration, including consideration of legislative compliance with the mandate of equal treatment.</SPAN></P>

Appellee state had filed an action to require the board member to vacate office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When elected, the board member lived in the district from which he was elected to serve on the Board of Governors of the Yavapai Community College. In the interim, new election districts were approved and the board member moved to a house that was located in the new district; however, the house was not within the old district. The trial court found that the new boundaries were not in effect when the board member moved; thus, he ceased to reside in his election district and, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-291(5), he could not continue to serve on the board. The board member argued that the statute that created the new election districts was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court concluded that (1) the adoption of the boundaries of an election district was a legislative act, and the authority to establish community college election districts was delegated to the board of supervisors by statute; (2) the board largely was free to fashion districts as it saw fit; (3) the legislature was free to set qualifications for members of the board of governors of a community college district; and (4) Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15-1441(A) was not inconsistent with Ariz. Const. art. 7, &sect; 15.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23-1065(C) (Supp. 1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrative law judge (ALJ) awarded the worker's compensation benefits to the claimant and denied petitioners' request for apportionment of the permanent partial disability compensation award. This determination was rested on the fact that although the claimant's cervical arthritis and either bilateral hand arthritis or occipital neuralgia were preexisting nonindustrial physical impairments rating 10 percent or more under the guidelines, the written record requirement was not satisfied as to the bilateral hand arthritis. In addition, the ALJ determined the evidence failed to establish that the cervical arthritis probably caused the occipital neuralgia and failed to establish that the occipital neuralgia was permanent. The commission affirmed the award. On appeal, the court concluded that the relevant statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23-1065(C), was constitutional despite its exclusion of industrially related impairments. Further, the court determined that the written records requirement applied to the claimant's impairment from bilateral hand arthritis, but the employer failed to satisfy the requirement. Thus, the court affirmed the decision that denied apportionment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued on appeal that the sprinkler retrofit ordinance was an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation because of the great expense and difficulty in retrofitting a building that contained asbestos. The owner also argued that the ordinance violated constitutional equal protection clauses because it exempted residential buildings and that its enforcement violated due process. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for the city. The court first determined that the claims were timely filed because the statute of limitations was tolled during exhaustion of administrative remedies. The court then held that merely having to spend a large amount of money to comply with the ordinance did not take away any of the owner' property rights and was not unconstitutional. The court also held that, given the extensive administrative procedures that addressed the owner's complaint, the owner had not been subjected to a violation of procedural due process. The court found no equal protection violation in exempting residential buildings and held that the exemption was supported by the differences in use and occupancy between commercial and residential buildings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) found that appellant juvenile violated the city's curfew for juveniles under the age of 16, which was set out at Phoenix, Ariz., City Code &sect; 22-1 (1993). Therefore, the trial court held that the juvenile was an incorrigible child. The juvenile sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile had her father's permission to go out with friends. She and her friends went to a park. The police took her in to custody when they responded to a report of a disturbance in the park. The juvenile court adjudicated her as an incorrigible child and imposed a penalty. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 22-1 was constitutional, and that it was neither overbroad nor vague. The court found that the juvenile did not meet her burden of proving that the parental permission exception exempted her from the curfew. While the juvenile enjoyed fundamental rights, including First Amendment freedoms and the right to move freely, those rights were not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults. The court found that curfew restrictions served a significant State interest that was not present in the case of adults. In making its determination that the State's significant interest justified infringing upon the juvenile's fundamental rights, the court examined three factors: (1) the peculiar vulnerability of children; (2) their inability to make critical decisions in an informed, mature manner; and (3) the importance of the parental role in child rearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the juvenile's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner contested the legality of the city's assessment for a new sewer installation. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the landowner, concluding that although the city's method of apportioning was not inherently discriminatory or arbitrary, the method used in the instant case was unconstitutional as applied. On review, the court reversed. Although Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-589 required a city to apportion an assessment according to the benefits each landowner received, it did not define a method to accomplish this mandate. All that was required by the city under constitutional law was that the city apportion the burden of assessments with approximate equality, upon a reasonable basis of classification, and with due regard to the benefits to the individual property owners. The city reasonably concluded that the landowner's share of the assessment was proportional to the benefits he received from the project.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the tax applied to all businesses and that there was no equal protection violation. Additionally the court determined that the municipality's failure to audit and assess out-of-state alarm monitoring companies was due to its original misunderstanding of the reach of the tax, and that this did not amount to a violation of equal protection.

Defendant agreed to the tests that resulted in excessive blood alcohol concentration readings. Defendant was not informed of his right to have an independent test performed. The lower court ruled that the failure of the arresting officer to inform defendant of his right to an independent blood alcohol test constituted a due process violation warranting the reversal of defendant's convictions. The court found that the lower court was incorrect in finding that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692(B) shifted the burden of proof to defendants. Furthermore, the court found no requirement that defendant be informed of his right to an independent test in order to satisfy due process.

The evidence also supported the trial court's determination that severance was in the children's best interests. Appellee Department of Economic Security (DES) had made diligent efforts to provide services to the mother, and the mother's failure to participate in the services DES offered did not foreclose termination of her parental rights. The trial court did not err in admitting a social study report into evidence under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-537.B. DES redacted the portions of the report to which the mother had objected, and the trial court did not rely on the unedited version of the report. The trial court did not violate the mother's due process rights by allowing DES to amend its petition to include a new ground for termination because the mother had adequate notice of the new ground.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer denied liability to appellee accident victims on the ground that its insured failed to disclose the existence of her husband, who was driving her car at the time of the accident.

The lower court granted the travel agency's motion to dismiss pursuant to Ariz. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The court remanded the parents' misrepresentation claim because it was not necessary to recite the magic language of an intentional misrepresentation claim and the parents adequately pled the cause of action. Further, the parents' unsafe facility claim was remanded because the negligence claim did not mention alcohol consumption; thus, it was not barred by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4-301. The court affirmed all other aspects of the lower court's decision because Arizona's dram shop laws only imposed liability on liquor licensees. Moreover, under Arizona tort law and the Mexican legal drinking age, the travel agency benefited from liability immunity under &sect; 4-301.

The trial court dismissed the state's indictment on the basis that &sect; 12-2458 was unconstitutionally vague because it neither internally defined, nor provided a reasonably ascertainable external basis for defining, the standard of &quot;reasonable support.&quot; On appeal, the court reversed and held that &sect; 12-2458 was susceptible to constitutional construction and was not unconstitutionally vague. The court remanded for proceedings consistent with its opinion. The court interpreted the term &quot;reasonable support&quot; in &sect; 12-2458 by reference to the definition of &quot;support&quot; in Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-2451(E). Through that interpretation, the court found that &sect; 12-2458 criminalized a parent's failure to provide sufficient support to maintain a child at a reasonable subsistence level with food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and the like. Therefore, &sect; 12-2458 was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The defendant was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and first degree murder, and his bond was set at $ 100,00 plus $ 40,000 in surcharges under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-2403.A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juvenile court judge transferred the defendant for adult prosecution and set the bail. The defendant argued that the surcharge constituted excessive bail in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. XIII and Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect;&sect; 15, 22. Former Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-2403.A provided for the imposition of a 40 percent surcharge on any fine, penalty, or forfeiture imposed and collected for criminal offenses. Section 41-2403.B required the bond to include the assessment. On appeal, the court found that the record was too limited to determine whether the bond was reasonable or unreasonable. To avoid an unconstitutionally excessive bail, the assessment had to be a part of the amount of bail that was sufficient to secure the defendant's attendance in court. Adding the assessment to a sufficient bail amount violated the constitutions. Section 41-2403.B was not unconstitutional as it was written when the statute intended to allocate as a surcharge a certain percentage of the bail. However, the court could not determine whether the trial court concluded that $ 140,000 was a reasonable bail or whether that conclusion was reasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the action to permit the trial court to determine whether the judge regarded $ 140,000 as reasonable bail, independent of the surcharge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, victim and mother (victim), appealed an order of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which granted defendant sublessee's motion for summary judgment on the victim's dram shop claims, on the ground that the sublessee was neither a licensee as defined in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4-101(19) nor subject to liability under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 4-311 and 4-301, and granted defendant campground operators' summary judgment motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, who was intoxicated, purchased alcoholic beverages from an inn. He later was injured in a diving accident in a lake near land subleased to the sublessee under a subconcession arrangement. The operators operated the campground under subconcession arrangements with the sublessee. The victim contended that the operators and sublessee negligently furnished or failed to prevent service of alcoholic beverages to him when he was already intoxicated, and failed to adequately warn that it was unsafe to dive in the water near the campground. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgments in favor of the sublessee and the operators. The court concluded that dram shop liability did not apply to the sublessee, as it did not actually perform or control the service, sale, or supply of liquor to an underage or obviously intoxicated person. The court noted that the victim was a public invitee with respect to the lake, but was seeking recovery from the sublessee of the land adjacent to the lake, not the lake owner. There was simply no relationship between the victim and the operators that would have imposed a duty of care on the sublessee and operators for the victim's benefit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment below granting summary judgment to the sublessee and the campground operators was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 28-692(A)(3) for driving or being in actual physical control of a vehicle while having a nonprescription drug or its metabolite in one's body, claiming that the statute was unconstitutional. Defendant's primary argument was that &sect; 28-692(A)(3) was vague and overbroad. She argued that it lacked specific guidelines for its application and permitted arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The court rejected her argument and affirmed the conviction and sentence, and held that the statute was constitutional. The court found that &sect; 28-692(A)(3) defined, in unequivocal terms, the type of behavior prohibited, and that it gave fair and objective guidelines to both potential offenders and law enforcement personnel that any driver who had ingested a proscribed drug was to be subjected to prosecution. The court concluded that she did not have standing to argue that &sect; 28-692(A)(3) was overbroad because she alleged neither a substantial infringement upon a protected First Amendment right nor that she was an innocent defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the board did not abuse its discretion when it granted the motion in limine and denied the tribe leave to supplement its notice of appeal.

The trial court found him to be a &quot;serious drug offender&quot; under Ariz. Rev.

The court found that the evidence of prior misconduct was excessive to the point that a jury had to believe that so many sales in the past indicated a disposition to sell cocaine on the occasion. The court found that giving a Ariz. R. Evid. 105 limited admissibility instruction did not cure the defect. The court concluded that the admission of the evidence of prior uncharged crimes was reversible error. The court found that at the time of a second deposition, defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine an unavailable declarant with regard to her first deposition and had the motive to do so in a manner that would discredit her in the jury's eyes.

However, the state's main legal theory was based upon its proposition that &sect; 13-3405(A)(4) constituted a strict liability crime.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended that &sect; 42-137(B)(4) was susceptible of more than one interpretation. Defendants asserted that &sect; 42-137(B)(4) was unconstitutionally vague regarding the point in time at which criminal liability attached and regarding the element of intent. The court disagreed with that contention because the statute was not vague or ambiguous with regard to the mental state required for its violation. Nevertheless, the court reversed and remanded defendants' convictions. The court concluded that the jury instruction given was incomplete and hence incorrect because the jury was not told that the element of knowledge applied to both the element of the failure to file and the element of the duty to file. Without the proper instruction, the state was relieved of the burden of proving defendants' knowledge of their duty to file state tax returns.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent claimant filed a workers' compensation claim against the employer alleging that he had sustained an industrial back injury. The Commission could not locate workers' compensation coverage for the employer, so it forwarded the claim to the No Insurance Section/Special Fund Division, which issued a notice of determination. The employer filed an untimely protest letter. An administrative law judge dismissed the protest as untimely and the Commission affirmed the award. The court affirmed, holding that the 30-day protest period for uninsured employers under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-947(A) was constitutional because the statute treated all uninsured employers alike, and there was a reasonable basis for giving uninsured employers a shorter protest period than insured employers, which had 90 days to file a protest letter. One basis for disparate treatment was that Arizona law required employers to carry workers' compensation insurance, so uninsured employers were in violation of the law. Another reasonable basis for the disparate treatment was that claimants face added administrative delay in obtaining workers' compensation benefits when their employer was uninsured.</SPAN></P>

The issue was whether the worker was entitled to collect total temporary disability from two carriers for two separate and distinct injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker injured his right knee and his right arm in two work-related accidents. Different carriers handled the claims. The arm was reinjured while the claim was open. The worker received temporary total disability. The knee claim was reopened and compensation paid until that carrier discovered that another carrier was making payments on the arm claim. The claims manager then apportioned the payments. The knee claim reopened a second time and the worker received payments from both carriers after he told the first that he no longer received anything from the second. The court agreed that the worker could not recover twice for the same loss of earning capacity. The court rejected the worker's argument that temporary total disability was not based on loss of earning capacity, but was based strictly on a medical assessment in which the fact and severity of the injury justified compensation. The court explained that the statutory language was mandatory and unqualified because an industrial injury at the total temporary stage caused a total loss of earning capacity. The court concluded that the worker had no standing to question how compensation was apportioned between the carriers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Industrial Commission's award to the worker, apportioned between the carriers, as approved by the administrative law judge.</SPAN></P>

The judge ordered the warrants and affidavits sealed after they were returned but before a criminal case was filed. The newspaper, which received redacted copies, brought a special action for release of the documents. The newspaper claimed that the phrase &quot;if the warrant is served, such documents and records shall be open to the public as a judicial record&quot; that was contained in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3918(A) mandated release of the warrants once they were returned. Although it acknowledged the presumption that information received by a court was open to the public, the court denied relief. The court ruled that adopting a mandatory interpretation of &sect; 13-3918(A) meant that the statute violated the separation of powers because only the state supreme court had the constitutional right to make procedural rules. The court adopted a permissive interpretation of &sect; 13-3918(A) and held that the issuing court, in its discretion, had the right to balance the presumption of openness against the state's need to keep confidential any information which had the potential to jeopardize ongoing criminal investigations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was engaged in the business of conducting guided river rafting tours through the Grand Canyon National Park.

After exhausting its administrative remedies, the taxpayer filed a complaint in the tax court. The tax court granted ADOR's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the taxpayer's guided river rafting trips did not come within the reach of the amusement tax statute as the statute applied to businesses charging admission fees, and the taxpayer was prohibited from charging an admission fee to the park and the fee charged was for the skill, direction, and service provided by the guide; and (2) where the statute listed 21 specific business classifications, none of which included an activity similar to guided river rafting trips, the amusement tax could not be extended to such services.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was one of 31 people indicted on 81 drug-related counts, and the state's case arose from the wiretapping of four telephones and its interception of some 500 calls, 17 of which were the basis of the case against defendant. He appealed his convictions on the basis of the wiretaps and the admission of the resulting evidence. The court affirmed the convictions and found that the Arizona wiretapping statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3010(A), was not unconstitutionally broader than the federal statute,&nbsp;18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2516(2). The court held that the affidavits filed in support of the wiretap application were adequate and that disclosure of the English translations of the transcripts of the intercepted conversations was sufficient to protect defendant's rights to timely disclosure. The court also found that permitting the transcripts of the English translations to go to the jury was proper because although the initial translations were made by police officers, a court interpreter later corrected the translations. The court further found that the officer who testified as an expert on the narcotics codes used by those whose conversations were intercepted was qualified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and the sentences imposed upon him but modified the imposition of the mandatory fine. The court found that the Arizona wiretapping statute was constitutional and that the procedures followed in obtaining the wiretap provided sufficient safeguards of defendant's rights and constituted substantial compliance with both the federal and state statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers challenged the Superior Court of Pima County's (Arizona) dismissal of their 1987 property tax appeal because of their failure to serve defendant county. The taxpayers also challenged the Arizona Tax Court's refusal to accept jurisdiction of their subsequent special action seeking a refund of the same 1987 property taxes. The appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Taxpayers challenged a tax assessment that deemed their property to be non-agricultural. The superior court's dismissal of the taxpayer's cause of action was affirmed because the court found that the taxpayers failed to serve an indispensable party, the county. The taxpayers also challenged the assessment in the tax court. The court reversed the tax court's refusal to accept jurisdiction of this special action seeking a refund from the 1987 property taxes because the assessment of the land as non-agricultural was erroneous within the meaning of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-506. Furthermore, the court found that the amendments to &sect; 11-506 did not apply retroactively as to disallow the refund. The court found that the taxpayers had a substantial present property interest, which qualified for protection under due process clauses of the United States and Arizona Constitutions. The court held that because the amendment was more than a mere clarification of the law and the right embodied in the statute was a substantive right, due process would have been violated with the amendment's retroactive application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court's previous opinion was vacated upon the granting of a motion to reconsider. The superior court's judgment dismissing the tax appeal was affirmed because the court found that the taxpayers had failed to serve an indispensable party. The tax court's judgment was reversed, however, because the court found an erroneous assessment within the meaning of the applicable statute and amendments to the statute did not apply retroactively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona), which entered a jury verdict convicting him of making an unlawful offer to sell a narcotic drug in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3408(A)(7). The jury was instructed that defendant had to act &quot;knowingly,&quot; and it was given the statutory definition of the term under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-105(6)(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that intent was an element of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3408(A)(7). The court on appeal disagreed, finding that only &quot;knowledge&quot; was required. The court also found that the statute was constitutional even when read in this manner. Prosecutions could not be had for &quot;offers made in jest&quot; because defendant would have to know that his conduct was that described as a criminal offense. Thus, the element of intent did not have to be read into the statute or proved by the State. On other issues, the court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction because preliminary negotiations constituted a completed offense. Money did not have to change hands. Defendant's actions in arranging for a later meeting to sell the drug were sufficient. The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a motion for summary judgment, the two parties submitted over 3,500 pages of exhibits, many of which appeared unnecessary. The trial court held a conference in which it sanctioned all the attorneys by ordering them not to charge their clients for time spent in the preparation and filing of the motion. The defense attorneys appealed. The court affirmed the trial court's order. The court found that it could not grant relief for the defense attorneys' alleged deprivation of due process because the defense attorneys had not requested a hearing on the specifications or for reconsideration of the sanctions imposed. Because they had not raised the due process issue in the trial court, the court could not review the issue on appeal. The trial court had the inherent power to sanction the defense attorneys for their actions, and Ariz. R. Civ. P. 11 did not deprive the trial court of this inherent power. Although the defense attorneys had written the trial court a letter asking the court to vacate its order, the letter was an inadequate substitute for a motion for reconsideration. Moreover, the imposition of sanctions had been within the sound judicial discretion of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee developers filed a complaint against the city claiming that Scottsdale Ordinance No. 1940 was invalid. The trial court held that the ordinance failed to meet the statutory requirements of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-463.05 (amended 1991). The city amended the ordinance and sought a new trial, which was denied. On appeal, the court held that because the less restrictive standards approach applied to &sect; 9-463.05, the statutory requirements imposed on the city were to be construed broadly. Specific plans and direct benefits were not required. The city only needed to show some rational basis for setting the amount of the fee in order to avoid it being clearly erroneous, arbitrary, and wholly unwarranted. Given the minimal burden of proof, the court held that the city's development fee would result in a beneficial use and it was imposed in a non-discriminatory manner.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the finding that the state did not violate the plea agreement was not error because defendant failed to show that his plea rested on the state's promise and because he failed to offer an objection at sentencing. There was no abuse of discretion because the judge considered the relevant factors offered by defendant in mitigation. The proceedings were not defective due to a conflict of interest because the trial judge's previous position in the same office as two of the attorneys was prior to defendant's case. The court also determined that defendant's plea was voluntarily and intelligently made because there was no factual support that he was not aware of the consequences of his guilty plea on his probationary status. Finally, the court held that the imposed sentences did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because they were not disproportionate to the extensive monetary loss to the victims and the lack of remorse by defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the trial court that the term &quot;designated party vote&quot; in &sect; 16-322(A)(8) referred to the number of party members voting in an election rather than the number of votes cast for a party's candidate. The city, as it had historically done, calculated the &quot;designated party vote&quot; by using the vote for the mayoral candidate within the ward. While historical interpretation was entitled to some weight, it could not have been taken as resolving an issue never raised. The court reasoned that the price of electoral success through appeal to voters outside the party ought not to have been an increase in the burden of running within the party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tenants of a mobile home park brought an action before a state agency against the park operator, alleging that the operator erroneously charged certain fees. The state agency hearing officer found for the tenants and ordered the operator to reimburse the tenants. The operator sought review in the lower court, alleging that the hearing officer exercised power in violation of the separation of powers provision of Ariz. Const. art. III. The lower court rejected the operator's argument and affirmed the decision of the hearing officer. The operator sought further review. On review, the court examined the authority of the hearing officer to conduct proceedings, as codified in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-2198.01 et seq. The court concluded that the role of the hearing officer did not usurp that of the judiciary, nor did it exert a coercive influence on the judiciary. The court found no merit in the operator's claim that the agency proceedings and the decision of the hearing officer deprived him of his constitutionally-guaranteed right to a jury trial. The proceedings before the state agency were restitutive in nature, and the right to a jury trial did not preclude such proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient filed a medical malpractice action against defendant hospital for injuries resulting from her gallbladder surgery. The parties submitted the matter to the trial court, stipulating that a jury would award plaintiff $ 175,000 as full damages sustained by plaintiff. Plaintiff appealed the trial court's determination that defendant was entitled to a credit of $ 175,000 and that because of the stipulation, plaintiff was not entitled to additional damages from defendant. The court reversed the trial court's decision because defendant had no constitutional right to invoke the law of joint and several liability. The court held that the legislature clearly intended Ariz. R. Civ.

The court concluded defendant was not entitled to a credit of $ 175,000 paid in settlement by the insurance company and doctor because plaintiff's lawsuit was commenced after the abrogation of joint and several liability, so Ariz.

Stat. &sect; 12-820.01 (1992) was unconstitutional. The court held that: (1) the qualified immunity provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-820.01 (1992) did not apply to the duty of the state to prescribe rules but that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-820.02 (1992) shielded the activity as an administrative function involving a fundamental governmental policy; (2) the state's mandatory policy combined with the statutes were rules identifying unfit drivers; and (3) that Ariz.

Instead, the mother surrendered her parental rights and put the child up for adoption. When the father learned of this, he contacted a Texas attorney who told him to contact an Arizona attorney. He ignored a consent to adoption form he received from the mother's attorney. The father spoke with the attorney over the phone and with the attorney for the adoptive parents. He decided to contest the severance and wrote a letter to the court in time for the initial severance hearing. The trial court denied the severance petition. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not apply the wrong standard in determining that the father did not abandon the child. The court took into account the father's age and circumstances. The court noted that the father had bought baby supplies and clothes in anticipation of the mother and child's return. The court emphasized fundamental rights of parents and held that the best interests of the child alone were not always grounds for severance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff association and members filed a taxpayer action challenging the validity of the fixed royalty provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 27-234(B). The trial court dismissed the complaint, but the association and members subsequently prevailed in the state Supreme Court and the federal Supreme Court. Upon remand to the trial court, the association and members requested an award of attorney's fees. When the trial court denied the request, the association and members again appealed. The appeals court concluded that this case met the criteria for an award under the private attorney general doctrine. The court reasoned that the resolution of the litigation benefitted a large number of people in the state, including taxpayers, students and personnel. Also, the vindication of the right asserted was of societal importance. Lastly, vindication of the right asserted by the association and members required a legal challenge to a statute adopted by the state legislature and thus could only have been privately enforced. The court rejected defendant land department's argument that it was a nominal party, precluding an award of attorney's fees, because it had a proprietary stake in the outcome.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions and held that &sect; 5-331(C) was constitutional. The court did not find clear and manifest congressional intent to preempt state law in the area of boat safety. On the contrary, the court found that 46 U.S.C.S. &sect; 4306 of the Federal Boat Safety Act authorized each state to regulate boat safety. The court noted that the United States Coast Guard believed that the federal legislation in the area of boat safety had not preempted the state's power to similarly legislate regarding the use of floatation devices by young children. The court concluded that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 5-331(C) neither conflicted with federal law nor frustrated the federal objectives. The court found that the state requirement that the life jackets had to be worn merely enhanced the minimum standards established by U.S. Coast Guard Reg. &sect; 180.25-5 that life preservers for children be stowed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff domesticated an amended California defamation judgment against the community property of defendant husband and under the Revised Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann, &sect; 12-1701 et seq. (1982). The Superior Court of Mojave County (Arizona) granted the husband and wife's motion to stay enforcement of the Arizona judgment and to vacate the portion of the judgment against the wife. The claimant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife argued that the California judgment against the their marital community was not valid in Arizona, contending that Arizona courts must apply Arizona law, which required the claimant to have proceeded against both spouses for the judgment to be valid against the community. Thus, the husband and wife argued that the judgment was effective only against the husband and could not be enforced against the community because the wife was not joined in the original California defamation action. The claimant argued that applying Arizona law would deny the judgment the full faith and credit to which it was entitled under U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1. The court held that the husband and wife's marital community was not deprived of due process by the earlier judgment in the action in which the wife was neither named nor served. Thus, original judgment was not tainted and because the judgment was effective against the community, there was no violation of due process in amending the judgment to reflect community liability. Consequently, both the original and amended judgments were entitled to full faith and credit in Arizona courts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order staying enforcement of the claimant's California judgment and vacating the judgment as to the wife and the husband and wife's community.</SPAN></P>

The superior court upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance, and defendant appealed. Defendant argued that the ordinance lacked an intent or mens rea requirement and was unconstitutional. The court explained that where a penal statute failed to expressly state the necessary element of scienter, the court was permitted to infer the scienter requirement from the words of the statute plus legislative intent. Here, the court inferred from the words &quot;solicit&quot; or &quot;hire&quot; the intent of defendant to thereby promote or facilitate the crime of prostitution. In addition, the ordinance did not sweep within its reach speech protected by the First Amendment. The ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague. Finally, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3214 made it clear that the legislature did not intend to preempt the field of regulation of prostitution.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of the state and reversed the summary judgment in favor of lessees. The court found that the grazing lands were held by the state in trust for the support of schools and other institutions, and held that in dealing with trust lands, all doubts were to be resolved in favor of the trust. The court rejected the lessee's challenge to the provisions for acquiring prospective water rights, finding that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 37-102, 132, and 132(A) authorized the state to set the terms of the leases, and that the lease provisions objected to were within the state's power to require. The court also found that a lessee did not have a right to compensation in the event of condemnation, and held that the state had authority to include a termination upon condemnation clause in the leases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant drove a car past the home of a member of a rival gang while his companion fired shots injuring a victim in the knee.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision in part and reversed it in part. The court held that: (1) the defendant was not entitled to an instruction on facilitation where the indictment did not set out facts that described aggravated assault in a way that also defined another offense; (2) the state's allegation of dangerousness did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers because it was within the executive branch's power to enhance punishment; and (3) the trial court could not impose restitution on the charges for which the defendant was not found guilty.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed contending that the fine imposed violated the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Ariz. Const. art.

Defendant argued that the fine should have been split equally among the three codefendants and that he should have been assessed only a one-third share. Affirming the fine, the court held that the fine required under &sect; 13-3405(D) was not restitution, subject to reduction by codefendants' contributions, but punishment for the indivisible culpability of defendant himself.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant engaged in repeated sexual acts with his daughter. A jury convicted defendant of four counts of sexual abuse and molestation. The trial court sentenced him to consecutive prison terms. Defendant appealed and filed a petition for post-conviction relief under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32. The appeal and Rule 32 petition were consolidated. The court affirmed defendant's convictions for sexual abuse and molestation and the sentences imposed. The court held that evidence that an uncle had previously molested the daughter would not have changed the verdict because the evidence against defendant based on the daughter's testimony and defendant's admission to police officers was overwhelming. The court also found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting defendant's claim that the sentencing procedure was unfair. The court concluded that that the imposition of consecutive sentences did not violate Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-116, which prohibited double punishment for one act. The court explained that although defendant's crimes were committed as part of one sexual episode, each factually distinct act of forcible sexual contact exposed the daughter to a separate harm.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona) awarded a prescriptive easement through adverse possession to the neighboring property owners and allowed them to build a block wall on the easement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dispute arose between two property owners when the neighboring property owners used a gravel driveway beside their house that they had constructed and the property owners put up a fence that interfered with the neighboring property owners' driveway. The court held that the prescriptive easement granted to the neighboring property owners was proper because it was possible for the trial court to have concluded that the neighboring property owners used the disputed land to gain a prescriptive easement by laying gravel and parking on it. The court determined that the gravel areas used by the neighboring property owners could have given notice to the whole world they had taken the area their driveway was on for their own use. The court reasoned that the neighboring property owners were not allowed to build the wall on the easement because that would exceed the uses through which they had acquired the easement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of a prescriptive easement in favor of the neighboring property owners and vacated the order that allowed them to build a wall on the easement.</SPAN></P>

The tax court held that the tax was no unconstitutional as applied to contracting income from federal government projects, and on appeal, the court affirmed because the tax did not fall directly on the federal government and the statutory scheme did not compel the contractors to shift the legal incidence of the tax to its purchaser. The tax court also held that the Department had not discriminatorily enforced the tax, and on appeal, the court affirmed because nothing demonstrated any significant quantifiable disparity actually existed between the proportion of out-of-state contractors who did federal contracting work in Arizona and were audited by the Department and the proportion of in-state contractors who do such work and were audited. The court held that the tax court expressly found no systematic policy of discrimination and no evidence showing the Department's manner of selecting taxpayers for audit relied upon inherently invidious standards.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4033(B) (1992) and Ariz. R. Crim. P. 17.1(e). The court modified the sentence to grant defendant credit for 214 days of presentence incarceration and to correct a minute entry to reflect the prior conviction admitted in the plea agreement and at the plea hearing. The court held that (1) the statutory amendments had only prospective application because a right to appeal was substantive, not procedural, and there was no waiver of defendant's right to appeal under Ariz.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge brought an action against the city challenging changes made in the way municipal judges were paid. The city denied the judge's claim for additional compensation. He brought an action for declaratory relief and contract damages. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment for the city. On appeal, the court affirmed. Section 2-83.1 did not violate Ariz. Const. art. IV, pt. 2, &sect; 17. The constitutional provision was inapplicable in a case concerning the practice of differently valuing and compensating distinct varieties of judicial duties rather than an across-the-board salary increase or decrease for members of a court with staggered terms of office. A legislative increase in superior court judges' salaries, the condition precedent to the vesting of the judge's right to receive increased salary payments calculated under the pre-amendment version of Phoenix, Ariz., City Code art. III, &sect; 2-83.1, never occurred while that version remained in effect. Because the judge had no vested contractual right in the pre-amendment &sect; 2-83.1 salary calculation method, the prospective alteration of that method did not reduce his compensation.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that neither was unconstitutionally vague. The court found that defendant had no standing to raise, on behalf of others, an overbreadth challenge to &sect; 28-692(A)(2), because he did not allege that the statute substantially infringed upon protected First Amendment freedoms or that he was a member of a class of &quot;innocent defendants.&quot; The court found that the essential element of &sect; 28-692(A)(2) was having a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 percent within two hours after driving.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of a property tax which was levied on property outside of organized school districts. The tax court agreed with the taxpayers and eventually ordered repayment of those taxes to the taxpayers, with interest.

The tax court ordered the general accountant to show cause, followed by orders for him to issue warrants for repayment. When he was called upon to execute those warrants, he did not comply. The tax court then held him in contempt and awarded the taxpayers their attorney fees against him personally. The state also was ordered to pay attorney fees.

Defendant ignored the court order placing him custody and walked out of the courtroom. Defendant admitted that he knew that he was not free to leave the courtroom.

The court affirmed the judgment, holding that defendant left the courtroom in defiance of the judge's order not to leave, knowing that the judge has placed him in custody. The court stated that the facts of the case clearly established that the judge placed defendant in custody and under arrest by use of &quot;constructive restraint.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was injured when containers delivered from the manufacturer fell on top of her as she unloaded them at her place of employment. She instituted an action for damages against the manufacturer but could not recover against her employer due to the workers' compensation laws. The trial court found that the manufacturer was one-third liable for the claimant's injuries, and it awarded her judgment against the manufacturer for one-third of her total damages. The claimant argued that &sect; 12-2506, which abolished joint and several liability, was unconstitutional and should not have been applied to reduce the judgment against the manufacturer. The court held that &sect; 12-2506 was constitutional. It concluded that the statute neither abrogated the right to bring an action for damages nor impermissibly limited the amount of recovery for an injury. It also ruled that the statute did not deny the claimant either the equal protection of the laws or due process of law, and it held that the statute did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the tax years 1984 through 1988, Arizona's income tax laws exempted from income taxation 100 percent of state and local retirement benefits paid to retired employees of those political entities, while exempting only the first $ 2,500 of federal retirement benefits paid to retired federal employees. After a similar Michigan income tax scheme was invalidated on the ground it violated the principles of inter-governmental tax immunity, the taxpayers filed an action against the Department claiming that the Arizona exemption statutes violated federal law. Although it declined to issue injunctive relief to the taxpayers, the lower court agreed, concluding that the statutory scheme taxing federal pensions violated federal law because it did not tax state pensions in the same way. The court held that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in declining to issue injunctive relief to the taxpayers under 42 U.S.C. S. &sect; 1983. The court also held, however, that the taxpayers' failure to exhaust their Arizona administrative remedies either in their individual or representative capacities prevented the lower court from ruling on their claims for Arizona income tax refunds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed in part and affirmed in part the judgment from the lower court and vacated the lower court's opinions. The court remanded the action for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 20-316(A)(4) and (7). The Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) affirmed the director's order. The adjuster appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adjuster withheld an insurer's check made out to him and to a restoration company that performed services for the insureds after a fire damaged their home. The restoration company had refused to allow the adjuster to obtain his fee out of the check proceeds. The Department of Insurance noticed a hearing alleging that the adjuster had illegally withheld monies received in the course of his activities as a licensed insurance adjuster. The hearing officer rejected the adjuster's claim that he withheld the check based on his clients' instructions, and found that he withheld the check because he wanted a portion of the proceeds. The hearing officer concluded that the adjuster intentionally violated &sect;&sect; 20-316(A)(4) and (7). The court upheld the superior court's judgment. First, neither the superior court nor the appellate court weighs the evidence, but determines only whether there was substantial evidence to support the administrative decision. Here, substantial evidence supported the decision. Second, &sect; 20-316(A)(7) was not unconstitutionally vague. Finally, the adjuster was not entitled to a peremptory challenge of the hearing officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a correctional officer, was dismissed from his employment with the DOC when its director became aware of the employee's mayoral position. The employee's dismissal was based solely on the prohibition under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-772, not his job performance. The superior court held &sect; 41-772 to be unconstitutional in its applicability to small towns and rural communities. On appeal, the court vacated the judgment and affirmed the employee's dismissal by the DOC. The court held that the challenged portion of &sect; 41-772 did not violate the employee's constitutional rights under the First or Fourteenth Amendments. Many governmental interests were served by that portion of &sect; 41-772 under consideration. The court held that the prohibition against state employees holding paid public office enhanced a government work force of efficient, apolitical employees; avoided the appearance of impartiality; and assured employee advancement based on merit. Although &sect; 41-772 did not define the phrase &quot;paid public office,&quot; the employee's mayoral position unquestionably fell within its common, ordinary definition.</SPAN></P>

The ALJ concluded that apportionment required a preexisting earning capacity disability, and that, although the claimant had a preexisting impairment, it was not earning capacity disabling before his industrial &quot;injury.&quot; On appeal, the court set aside the award denying apportionment under the occupational disease apportionment statute because the ALJ misinterpreted Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23-901.05 to require a preexisting earning capacity disability. At issue was the meaning of &quot;disability or death from any other cause not itself compensable.&quot; Applying the words' common meaning, the court interpreted them to mean any other cause, including a previous disability, a previous impairment, or even a latent condition that was a cause in fact of a disability or death, and not earning capacity disability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was given three breathalyzer tests and only the last one was preserved. Defendant claimed that the admission of the third test result was error, based on Ariz. Rev.

Defendant contended that subsection three always requires duplicate tests because a range comparison was obviously inapplicable when there was but one test. The court held that a single test preserved the reliability of its result by a 20-minute pre-test observation period, the purpose of which was to prevent an artificially high test result due to recent alcohol consumption. The court held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692.03(A)(3) did not require duplicate tests for a test result that was preceded by a 20 minute observation period and, therefore, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the third test result.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient, a paranoid schizophrenic, appealed from an order committing him to inpatient treatment at a state hospital and subsequent supervised outpatient treatment on the grounds of mental illness. The patient asserted that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-501(29) was unconstitutional. The court disagreed and affirmed the order of commitment. The court held that the establishment of &quot;persistently or acutely disabled&quot; as a category for the involuntary commitment of the mentally ill, was not unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. Under the parens patriae power, the state had the authority to provide care for those citizens who, due to emotional or mental disorders, were unable to care for themselves. Additionally, the court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the patient was persistently and acutely disabled. These factors included hearing voices, hallucinations, and paranoia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was acquitted of aggravated assault because he was not responsible by reason of insanity and was committed to the custody of the hospital.

However, the court affirmed the trial court's finding that &sect; 13-3994 was constitutional because (1) due process was not violated by conditionally releasing an acquittee for an indefinite period of time because the nature and duration of conditionally releasing a person was reasonably related to the purpose of the release; and, (2) there was a rational basis for permitting acquittees to be conditionally released for an indefinite period of time while persons civilly committed were conditionally released for specific time periods. Also, &sect; 13-3994(B) did not require that a 50-day release hearing be held absent a request by the acquittee, and the 120-day mandatory commitment period of &sect; 13-3994(D) satisfied due process.</SPAN></P>

The pensioners argued that post-retirement benefit increases violated the state constitution's extra compensation and gift clauses and the contract clause of both the state and federal constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pensioners brought an action against the state and county retirement funds and their officials claiming that post-retirement increase of benefits violated the state extra-compensation clause, Ariz.

II, &sect; 25, and federal, U.S. Const. art I, &sect; 10, constitutions. The court held that the extra-compensation clause was not violated because the increased benefits did not come from state funds. Instead, the various respondent pension plans were funded by individual and employer contribution or by investment earnings. Nor was the gift clause violated because pension benefits were not gifts; they were deferred compensation for services rendered by the pensioners during their employment. Finally, the court applied a three factor test derived from federal cases, and concluded that the increased benefits were for the public good and did not impair any contractual relationship because all of the pension plans were fully funded and able to meet there contractual duties without jeopardizing the rights of vested beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1046 to respondent natural mother of respondent employee after the employee's death. An administrative law judge found that the natural mother was a dependent under the provisions of &sect; 23-1046.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was adopted by the mother and stepfather of her natural mother. The employee was raised as her natural mother's sister. When the employee turned 18, she went to live with and care for her natural mother. After the employee was injured while working for the employer, she filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits. She underwent surgery and subsequently died as a result of complications from the surgery. In the natural mother's action for death benefits, the employer conceded that she was partially dependent on the employee. The administrative law judge awarded death benefits to the natural mother, but the court set aside the award. The court held that death benefits awarded under &sect; 23-1046 were limited to the class of dependents specified in &sect; 23-1046(A). The court found that &sect; 23-1046(A) specified dependents as surviving spouses, surviving children, parents, brothers, and sisters. Because the natural mother's parental rights were terminated at the time of the employee's adoption, she was not considered a parent. In addition, &sect; 23-1046(B) did not broaden the class of dependents to include any individual who was in fact dependent upon the deceased employee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to possession of heroin. The parties stipulated that defendant would pay a $ 2,000 fine and surcharge to the Arizona Drug Enforcement Fund.

On appeal, the court held that where the trial court judge did not control expenditures from the drug enforcement account, his salary was fixed by statute and was not dependent upon fines levied in criminal cases, he did not have the discretion under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-811(C) or Ariz. Rev.

The state and several utilities argued this would allow the rules to take effect even if not approved by the attorney general as required by statute.

The state supreme court ordered certification, but did not address submission to the attorney general. The court held that the commission did not have to submit the rules to the attorney general.

The issues presented were whether the carrier's lien was limited to the amount of benefits paid, whether the lien provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1023 violated the Arizona Constitution, and whether the lien extended to a spouse's award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee fell after stepping out of a doorway into an area where the sidewalk had been removed by a construction company. She filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits and received medical and compensation benefits from her employer's carrier. The employee and her husband asserted loss of consortium and filed a third-party negligence claim against the construction company. The jury awarded damages to them. The employee reimbursed the carrier for benefits paid, but objected to the carrier's claim of credit against future benefits. The administrative law judge found in favor of the carrier, holding that its lien could not be reduced by the employer's degree of fault and that it attached to the husband's award. On review, the court ruled that the carrier's lien was not limited to the amount of benefits paid, that the lien provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1023 did not violate the Arizona Constitution, and that the lien extended to the husband's award for loss of consortium. The court affirmed the award because the employee had the option to reject workers' compensation and pursue a third-party judgment free of an employer's lien, but chose not to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the award of workers' compensation to the employee, and affirmed the carrier's lien against the employee's third-party judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the trial court as charged after the evidence showed that defendant, who had been drinking, led police on a high speed chase when police attempted to pull him over. This chase went to speeds over 100 miles per hour and defendant led the chase through residential neighborhoods. Defendant appealed his convictions and claimed the statutes at issue, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 28-622.01 and 28-624(C) were unconstitutionally vague. Defendant also claimed the fine accessed was excessive and violative of the Eighth Amendment. On appeal, the court affirmed and found defendant's claims meritless. The court found it was clear that it was felonious conduct to willfully flee or attempt to elude a pursuing police vehicle sounding an audible signal even if its colored light or lens were not visible from in front of the vehicle. Thus, the statutes were not unconstitutionally vague. Also, it could not be said that the fine imposed on defendant was either so shocking or so unreasonable as to be unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

The court found that regardless of whether the Domestic Violence Diversion Program was mandatory or discretionary under the plea agreement stipulations, the trial court placed defendant on probation pursuant to &sect; 13-3601(G). The court found that having done so, the trial court had no authority to enter the judgment of guilt. The court reversed and concluded that in essence, the trial court rejected a provision of the plea agreement and did not provide defendant with an opportunity to withdraw her plea as provided for by Ariz.

Defendant also challenged the enhancement of his sentence, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604(I) (1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was previously convicted of issuing bad checks in Montana. When defendant was convicted of crimes in Arizona, the trial court enhanced his sentence, based on a prior felony conviction in Montana. The state contended that defendant's conduct constituted a felony in Arizona. Originally, the court affirmed defendant's sentence and conviction. However, on reconsideration, the court vacated the sentence. The court held that there was not strict conformity between Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-6-316 (1983) and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1801(B). Only &sect; 13-1801(B) required an intent to deprive. Therefore, defendant could have committed the crime of issuing a bad check in Montana without engaging in conduct that would constitute a felony in Arizona. Moreover, defendant's conduct also did not constitute a violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2310. The court held that &quot;intent to defraud&quot; under &sect; 13-2310 meant more than merely issuing a check knowing that there were insufficient funds to pay it. The trial court did not err in considering aggravating factors in sentencing. Finally, the court noted that the use of defendant's prior conviction for impeachment purposes was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee received an industrial eye injury. A workers' compensation claim was filed, accepted for benefits, and a permanent impairment was awarded. Thereafter, the employee requested that his claim be reopened because a physical examination revealed that he needed additional surgery. The insurer denied the claim. The employee then filed an untimely hearing request. The administrative law judge (ALJ) entered an award dismissing the hearing request for lack of jurisdiction. The ALJ found that the employee did not receive the notice from the insurer, but the insurer presented evidence that the notice was properly mailed. On appeal, the court found that under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-947, the legislature excused late filing if there was a clear and convincing showing that the employee did not receive the notice of claims status, but also provided that no excuse would be honored if it was shown that the claims status was properly mailed. The effect of that conflict was to deprive the employee of a hearing despite a clear and convincing showing that he never received the employer's notice of claims status. Thus, his due process right to notice and a hearing was violated.</SPAN></P>

In the other case, the trial court granted the state a new trial. The corporation held the trial court erred in granting JNOV and a new trial to the state and the state held that even if the court reversed the trial court's findings, they were entitled to a new trial for the other case as well. On appeal, the court held that the proper date of valuation was the date that the corporation filed their inverse condemnation suit because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1123(A), which set the date of valuation at the date of the issue of the summons, applied to inverse condemnations as well. The court held that JNOV was improper because the jury had been properly instructed as to the issue of severance damages and had found for the corporation and just because it was less then the experts had said it was had not made the verdict erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant alleged that the insurer knowingly breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing in her workers' compensation claim. The claimant challenged &sect; 23-930, by contending that it unconstitutionally limited her damages for bad faith and deprived her of her right to a trial by jury. The trial court found that the claimant elected the workers' compensation law for her remedy and that the industrial commission was the forum for her claims, pursuant to &sect; 23-930. On appeal, the court held that the cause of action for insurance bad faith did not exist at common law and was therefore not protected by Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 6. Section 6 only protected actions recognized at common law at the time of its adoption. Further, the court held that the claimant did not have a right to a jury trial because Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 23, only guaranteed preservation of the right to a jury trial that existed at common law. The court found no error in the requirement of Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23-941, that workers' compensation hearings be held before an administrative law judge rather than a jury. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23-930, was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the motion to dismiss, defendant argued that portions of Ariz. Rev. Stat.

Although the trial court agreed, it denied defendant's motion to dismiss, finding that the unconstitutional portions were severable and that the remainder was not unconstitutionally vague. In the severability challenge, defendant argued that the severance of the two provisions was inappropriate. The court upheld the severance of Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-2458(B), (C) (Supp. 1991) and denied relief to defendant. The court also declined to accept jurisdiction on the vagueness issue. The court held that it was sufficient to sever the unconstitutional portions of Ariz. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a non-profit corporation that ran a nursing-care institution, filed an action against the department of revenue (department), seeking to recover use taxes, penalties, and interest that it had paid under protest.

The department cross-appealed from the portion of the judgment that declined to impose late-payment penalties on the taxpayer for two months. The court found that the taxpayer was liable for use taxes on its purchases of certain goods. The court further found that the tax court properly declined to abate the penalties assessed against the taxpayer for taxes due before July 1, 1986.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-1302 (1989) and then deferred entry of defendant's judgment of guilt and placed defendant on three years probation pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-3601(H) after imposing sentence under the domestic violence statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-3601.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action arose after defendant removed her children from their adoptive parents' home without consent after she had consented to the adoption of her children by her aunt and uncle. The state contended the prosecutor did not concur with the sentence that was required under the statute and since defendant's parental rights had been severed, she was no longer related to the children within the requisite degree and was not entitled to have been classified as a domestic offender under Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-3601(A). The court found there were certain crimes designated as family offenses in which a court may have treated defendant more leniently and required the offender and victims had to been related by blood to the second degree of consanguinity. The court concluded the blood relationship between defendant and her children was not extinguished by the adoption as they were still related in the first degree of consanguinity. The court held the requirement of prosecutorial concurrence with the sentence violated the separation of powers under Ariz. Const. art. 3. The court held the prosecutorial concurrence could have been severed from the statute and affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Between the time of defendant's offense and his sentencing, the amended Ariz. Rev.

When the trial court imposed the 40 percent surcharge, defendant argued that the trial court applied the law unconstitutionally ex post facto. On review, the court held that whether the law was applied ex post facto depended on whether it was considered a substantive law or a procedural one; procedural laws could be applied retroactively but substantive laws could not. The court concluded that by law, the surcharge was considered a criminal penalty, and therefore, the additional or increased penalty provided for the crime after the crime was committed was impermissibly ex post facto within the constitutional prohibition. The trial court should have imposed the 37 percent surcharge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to impose the 37 percent surcharge rather than the 40 percent surcharge, and as so modified affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

He was granted summary judgement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business was an Illinois business entity engaged in the location of heirs. The business owner's brother discovered an unprobated estate in Arizona. He located some heirs, and the lawyer was hired to represent them. The lawyer received information that the heir had a superior claim to the estate than the others. The heir executed an agreement with the business and agreed to a fee of 40 percent of the estate. The lawyer was hired to represent him. The heir later hired his own attorney and filed suit to have the contract declared unenforceable. The trial court granted summary judgement to the heir and denied the motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court held that Arizona law was the proper law to be applied, and under Arizona law the heir locator contract was unenforceable as contrary to public policy. The investigator and the business owner were not licensed as private investigators. The lack of the required licenses voided the contract. The court found that the contract was unenforceable because the fee exceeded the statutory maximum of 30 percent of the value of the recovered property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The survivors brought an action against the physician and his wife for medical malpractice resulting in the death of the survivors' family member. The trial court found that the periodic payment statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-581 through 12-591, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court disagreed and found that the statute, which allowed for the periodic payment of any judgment for loss of future economic benefits in medical malpractice cases, was constitutional. The statute did not unconstitutionally limit the survivors' recovery of damages. It was true that one or more of the survivors might die prematurely and thus not receive the full amount of damages or be able to will the damages to an heir. The survivors' right to transmit property on death, however, was not a fundamental right. It was also true that the physician and his wife might go bankrupt and be unable to pay the judgment, but Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 31, and art. XVIII, &sect; 6, were not designed to protect the survivors from an uncollectable judgment. The periodic payment statute did not deny the survivors the equal protection of the laws.

The carrier denied compensability. The court affirmed the commission's decision granting judgment for petitioners. The court determined that Ariz. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 8 did not exclusively define the types of risks that were to be covered by the state's workers' compensation laws and that an interpretation of Ariz. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 8 that permitted compensability for actual and positional risks did not result in an unconstitutional taking of property without due process of law. The employee's injury occurred by accident under Arizona law because pain was not an unexpected consequence of the movement that she made. The employee moved her head for a business reason rather than a personal one, therefore the injury occurred in the course of employment. The legislature had the inherent power to enact workers' compensation coverage and that power was not expressly denied to the legislature because its exercise was not contrary to an express power. Liability without fault was commonplace and did not subject the workers' compensation legislation to strict scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant town sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which denied its request for injunctive relief against appellee property owners. Appellant had declared a road to be a public highway, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1861(B), and had sought to prevent appellees from erecting a barricade which blocked access to an unpaved portion of that road.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee property owners filed an action for inverse condemnation against appellant town, based upon appellant's declaration that a road passing over appellees' property was a public highway. Appellees also contended that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1861(B) was unconstitutional. The trial court granted partial summary judgment, holding that the statute permitted an unconstitutional taking without just compensation. Appellant sought an injunction against any present or future barricade over the road. The trial court denied the request, holding that appellant had an adequate remedy at law. Appellant sought review, and the court reversed and remanded, holding that &sect; 28-1861(B) was constitutional. The court held that there could be no unconstitutional taking where appellees had lost their property rights by failing to preserve them from public use. The court noted that once appellees' rights were lost, there was no right to compensation and that appellant had a right to the property. Accordingly, the statute was constitutional. The matter was remanded for an evaluation as to appellant's request for an injunction, as there was no adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision, holding that a statute which authorized appellant town to take property for a public highway after a period of time of use by the public was constitutional. The court held that where property rights of appellee property owners had been lost to the public, there could be no taking and therefore no right to compensation. The matter was remanded for a determination as to the injunction request.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 4-312(B), which purportedly gave immunity to appellees, did not apply to the matter and, alternatively, that it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action for negligence, appellant administratrix charged that appellees, national fraternity, local chapter, fraternity members, and state board of regents, were liable for her decedent's injuries and death that resulted from a collision with an underage, intoxicated fraternity member who had recently driven away from a fraternity party. The trial court granted summary judgment for appellees. On review, appellant claimed that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4-312(B), which purportedly gave immunity to appellees, did not apply and that it was unconstitutional. In affirming the summary judgment for appellees, the court reconciled &sect; 4-312(B) with Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4-301, which provided immunity to a social host only if the person furnished alcohol was over 21. The court concluded that &sect; 4-312(B) implicitly repealed &sect; 4-301 by rendering it essentially redundant. The court also held &sect; 4-312(B) was constitutional. Although &sect; 4-312(B) provided immunity to appellees for appellant's loss, thereby abrogating a cause of action, appellant recovered damages from the intoxicated driver, so that &sect; 4-312(B) did not violate the constitutional provisions against the abrogation of a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1046 for lack of jurisdiction. An administrative law judge (ALJ) found that petitioners were not dependents under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1064 at the time of the employee's injury. Respondent carrier was also a party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sustained an industrial injury and received workers' compensation benefits. At the time of the injury, the employee was married to his former wife. After a divorce, the employee married the widow. The employee and the widow had one child together, and the widow had two children from a prior marriage. The employee died from a complication from the injury. Petitioners' death benefit claim was denied. At a hearing, the ALJ dismissed the case. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court read Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1046 in conjunction with Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1064 and held that the widow was not a dependent. Although &sect; 23-1064(A)(1) stated that a wife was conclusively presumed dependent upon a husband whom she had not voluntarily abandoned at the time of the injury, the crucial time for the presumption to be effective was at the time of injury. The widow was not married to the employee at the time of injury. The employee's child and stepchildren were not entitled to death benefits because they were neither born nor dependent upon the employee at the time of the injury. Because the employee elected to receive benefits, petitioners could not bring a wrongful death action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner alleged that he was unconstitutionally confined and that the prison officials had denied his constitutional right of access to the courts. The court found that the trial court denied the petitioner's motion for an extension of time to file a response to the prison officials' motion to dismiss but that the record showed no opposition to the motion for more time. The petitioner averred that the prison officials had not provided him with any access to Utah law so that he could challenge his transfer to the Arizona prison. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court reasoned that the right of access to the courts clearly extended to the inmates' challenges to the legality of their confinement or the conditions of their confinement. The state had an affirmative obligation when the inmate was an indigent prisoner. The state was not always bound to provide a lawyer to the inmate but it must provide some form of legal assistance adequate for a meaningful opportunity to be heard in court. Here, the state was required to furnish the inmate with adequate legal materials to ensure his access to the courts.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment for the heir and found that the agreement was unenforceable. The trial court denied the heir locators' motion for a new trial. The heir locators appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendants were convicted after a jury trial for the sale of unregistered securities and the sale of securities by an unregistered salesman. After determining whether the notes were securities by a seven-factor test, if the jury found the notes not to be securities, it was instructed that defendants had no duty to register the notes as securities or themselves as securities dealers. The defendants contended that because no one could have known in advance under Arizona's statutory scheme whether the notes at issue here crossed that line from commercial transaction (non-security) to investment transaction (security), the statutes failed to specifically define the crime. The court determined that defining security to mean any note under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-1841 and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-1842 was vague and that a limiting instruction would not cure the constitutional taint of vagueness. The court reversed the convictions and sentences of defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant caseworker appealed the decision of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which awarded plaintiff decedent's parents damages on their claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for the wrongful removal of decedent and his subsequent death. Plaintiffs cross-appealed from the dismissal of their state tort claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff decedent's parents brought an action against defendant caseworker under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and state tort law for the wrongful removal of decedent, a two-month old boy, and his subsequent death. The trial court determined that defendant was only entitled to qualified immunity for her conduct and actions, dismissed plaintiffs' state tort law claims because they were barred by limitations, and upheld a jury verdict of damages for plaintiffs on the &sect; 1983 claim. The court reversed the trial court and held that defendant was entitled to absolute immunity for her actions relating to the dependency proceedings and, thus, the &sect; 1983 claim based on those activities was barred. The court found that defendant's conduct in her investigation was entitled to qualified immunity and that her conduct did not violate a clearly established statutory or constitutional right and, thus, the plaintiff's claim was barred. The court reversed the trial court's decision to dismiss the state tort law claims because there was sufficient evidence to create a jury question of whether there was excusable neglect that defeated the limitations period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner was served with a notice of seizure for forfeiture. Instead of filing a claim asserting his interest in the property, the owner filed a motion to dismiss the complaint alleging that it failed to state a claim. The state responded, urging the trial court to deny the motion because the owner's failure to file a claim left him without standing to file the motion to dismiss. On appeal from the judgment in favor of the state, the court found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4311(D) required the owner to file a claim within 30 days of the notice of forfeiture and that the deadline was not extended by his filing a motion. Ariz. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(1) extended the time for filing a responsive pleading, but not a claim. The court found that in an in rem forfeiture proceeding, the property rather than the owner was the party. To contest the forfeiture, the owner was required to become a &quot;claimant&quot; by filing a claim. Affirming the judgment, the court held that the owner failed to demonstrate his standing by filing a timely claim setting forth his interest in the property at issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state requested a stay of proceedings in the Maricopa County Superior Court (Arizona), where the respondents, business owners, objected to hearsay testimony in an order to show cause hearing pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4310(B), and asserted that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4310(E)(2) was unconstitutional because it invaded the supreme court's rule making authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed a notice of seizure and pending forfeiture of personal property belonging to owners. At show cause hearing, the state offered hearsay testimony to establish probable cause. The owners objected to the hearsay testimony, asserting that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4310(E)(2), which permitted hearsay testimony to establish probable cause, was unconstitutional. The trial court sustained the objection. On appeal, the court held &sect; 13-4310(E)(2), as applied to order to show cause hearings, was constitutional and that the trial court had erred in excluding the hearsay testimony. Recognizing that Ariz. Const. art. 6, &sect; 5(5) gave the supreme court the power to promulgate the rules of evidence and hearsay testimony was admissible to prove probable cause in other hearings wherein only preliminary determinations were made, the court held that the exception to the hearsay rule provided in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4310(E)(2) was consistent with the purpose of the hearsay exceptions in Ariz. R. Evid. 803 and 804. The court rejected the owners' assertion that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4310(E)(2) was not reasonable and workable because it treated the parties to a forfeiture action differently.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The public interest groups claimed that the statute violated the gift clause of Ariz. Const., art.

The public interest groups sought a declaratory judgment invalidating certain portions of the act, a declaratory judgment invalidating quitclaim deeds already issued pursuant to the act, and an injunction against issuance of further quitclaim deeds. The court held that when a court reviewed a dispensation of the public trust property, public purpose and fair consideration must be shown, and the statute violated the public trust doctrine and gift clause because the statute failed to provide a mechanism for particularized assessment of (1) the validity of the equal footing claims that it relinquished; (2) the continuing value of land subject to such claims for purposes consistent with the public trust; (3) equitable and reasonable consideration for claims that could be relinquished without impairing the public trust; and (4) conditions that could be necessary to any transfer to assure that public trust interests remain protected.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A home was burglarized and it was determined that various household items had been stolen. A detective identified defendant as a possible suspect and a computer check revealed that defendant was the subject of an outstanding arrest warrant. The existence of the warrant was confirmed with the originating agency. When the detective accompanied other officers to defendant's home to effect an arrest based on the warrant, he observed items similar to those reported stolen. This information was incorporated into a search warrant affidavit, and a search warrant was issued and served. The items observed by the detective were seized and introduced as evidence at defendant's trial. At the hearing on defendant's motion to suppress, it was revealed that the arrest warrant had been quashed and erroneously re-entered into the computer system. The trial court denied defendant's motion based on the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. Noting that defendant's conviction was based on items that were seized as a result of his illegal arrest, the appellate court reversed the conviction and remanded for the entry of an order granting defendant's motion to suppress and for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowners sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which denied their application for attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 and which dismissed their action that sought a judgment reinstating a decision of the board of adjustment and that sought declarative and injunctive relief based on the alleged unconstitutionality of Ariz.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to an appeal filed under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-462.06(J), the city council reversed a decision of the board of adjustment (board) that granted an indefinite extension of the use permit for business traffic issued to the homeowners. The homeowners brought an action against defendants, city, mayor, and council members, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court deferred judgment and remanded the matter to the city council for rehearing. After rehearing, the council affirmed the board's decision. The trial court then denied the homeowners' application for attorneys' fees and dismissed the homeowners' action as moot. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment as to the denial of attorneys' fees. The court found that the homeowners were entitled to an award of attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 because they were the prevailing party, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 was an appropriate basis for relief, and there were no special circumstances that rendered an award of fees unjust. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the remainder of the homeowners' action because once the use permit was reinstated the constitutionality of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-462.06(J) became moot.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court with respect to the dismissal of the remainder of the homeowners' action that sought reinstatement of the board of adjustment decision and declarative and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vendor was cited for operating a mobile, open fruit-vegetable stand at an intersection, in violation of Pima County, Ariz., Code &sect; 18.43.020(A). Section 18.43.020(A) required all business within a specified zone to be conducted in completely enclosed buildings unless otherwise specified. A zoning hearing officer (officer) found the vendor in violation of the ordinance and imposed a fine. The board affirmed the officer's decision. The vendor appealed pursuant to the Administrative Review Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-901 through 12-914, and the trial court affirmed the action of the board. On review, the court affirmed, holding that board did not act illegally, arbitrarily, capriciously, or in abuse of its discretion. The court found that the officer had jurisdiction to rule on the vendor's violation. The court noted that the zoning code did not arbitrarily prohibit the vendor from operating a legitimate business; it merely prohibited businesses in a specified zone from operating in other than completely enclosed buildings. Finally, the court found that the enclosed building zone requirement passed the rational basis test and thus, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sanitation and waste-handling companies claimed that the city's extension of its sanitation regulations and services into the newly annexed area of the city constituted a compensible taking under the United States Constitution and the Arizona Constitution because it resulted in economic hardship to them. The trial court dismissed their amended complaint. On appeal, the court reviewed the motion to dismiss, taking as true the facts alleged by the non-moving parties. The court determined that there was no inverse condemnation and no unconstitutional taking of the sanitation and waste-handling companies' property without just compensation. The sanitation and waste-handling companies conceded that the city's sanitation regulations were proper and enforceable exercises of its governmental powers. The court ruled that the city's activities created lawful competition with the sanitation and waste-handling companies, but did not foreclose the sanitation and waste-handling companies from participation in providing services to the annexed area. The trial court's dismissal was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner and the city had been involved in a long-standing dispute concerning the abandoned vehicles, weeds, trash, and other debris on the owner's property. The city council had declared that the eminent domain action was necessary to abate a nuisance and to restore the property to a habitable condition. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order granting partial summary judgment in favor of the city. The court held that the owner on appeal did not waive the right to challenge the condemnation based on his failure to respond to the city's motion for partial summary judgment. On the merits of the appeal, the court held that the city did not have authority to abate the nuisance on the owner's property through the power of eminent domain. The court found that the condemnation did not relate to the taking of property for the purpose of constructing roads, streets, and alleys, as permitted by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1111(6). The court stated that the city had the specific statutory authority to remove the debris on the owner's property and to assess the cost of removal as a lien upon the property, thus, permitting judicial foreclosure if the owner did not pay the cost.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty in the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) to two counts of sale of narcotic drugs, in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3408. Defendant's sentence included concurrent prison terms, a felony assessment of $ 200.00, a fine of $ 2,740.00 and an $ 8.00 time payment fee (TPF), which was imposed under Ariz. Rev. Stat. 12-116. On appeal, defendant claimed error in the imposition of the TPF.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-116, which authorized assessment of an $ 8.00 TPF on any person who paid a court penalty, fine, or sanction on a time basis was an ex post facto law and also that it violated equal protection. Addressing defendant's claim, the court noted that &sect; 12-116 provided that a part of the TPF was required to be deposited into the judicial collection enhancement fund, some of which would be used for county public defender training, whereas another portion of it could be utilized by the court imposing the TPF in order to improve, maintain and enhance the court's ability to collect and manage monies. Because precedent had declared &sect; 12-116 to be procedural in nature and that it did not impose any penalty upon a defendant, the court rejected defendant's claim that it violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws set forth in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Because &sect; 12-116 did not impact a fundamental right and it was rationally related to the legitimate state interest of facilitating the collection of fines, penalties, and sanction, it withstood defendant's equal protection attack.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding no error in the sentence imposed upon defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the airplane manufacturer's motion to dismiss the parents' strict liability claim, in which it argued that the claims were barred by Arizona's 12-year limitations period for product liability cases. The order of dismissal contained Ariz. R. Civ. P. 54(b) language, which allows a trial court to certify finality to a judgment that disposes of one or more, but not all, of multiple claims upon a determination that there is no just reason for delay and directs the entry of judgment. The parents objected to the language because they also asserted negligence claims against the airplane manufacturer, but the order was entered anyway. The parents filed a notice of appeal. The court dismissed the appeal, holding that it lacked jurisdiction in the case because the order of dismissal was not a final judgment despite the Rule 54(b) language in the order. The court found that the judgment was not final because it did not dispose of a separate claim of a multi-claim action, as required. The court stated that the strict liability claim was not separate from the negligence claim, but merely a separate, alternative theory of recovery.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also ordered that defendant be placed on lifetime probation upon his release from prison. Defendant pled guilty to one count of attempted child molestation, a dangerous crime against children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant met the victim as an umpire for the victim's baseball team in March 1987. Shortly thereafter, numerous sexual encounters occurred. Defendant took the victim camping on April 26, 1987, and then drove him to California. Defendant was convicted in federal court of kidnapping and transportation of a minor for sexual purposes. Defendant pled guilty in this case to attempted child molestation occurring on or about April 18, 1987. Counsel argued that the imposition of lifetime probation was unlawful and that the imposition of a consecutive sentence violated appellant's constitutional protection against double jeopardy. The court modified and affirmed as modified. The court held that: (1) where Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604.01 authorized probation in lieu of, and not in addition to, the imposition of sentence on one offense, the trial court erred in imposing lifetime probation in addition to the prison sentence; (2) the trial court did not err in imposing a consecutive sentence; and (3) the presentence report contained sufficient evidence from which the trial court could have concluded that the victim suffered severe emotional trauma as a result of defendant's repeated molestations.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that his conviction violated his right to free speech, that the statute was overbroad, and that his sentence was disproportionate to his crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the state convicted him of offering to sell a narcotic in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3408, defendant appealed on two grounds. First, he argued that the statute violated both the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 6, because the statute punished speech and was overbroad. Second, he argued that because the statute punished an offer to sell narcotics with the same sentence as a completed sale, his sentence was disproportionate to the crime, in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 15. The court explained that statutes were entitled to a presumption of constitutionality. The legislature had the power to define crimes and to prohibit crimes in which speech was used to carry out the illegal act. Such speech was not protected by the state or federal constitutions. Similarly, the legislature had the power to penalize the offer to sell in the same manner as a completed sale. The &quot;offer&quot; was a completed crime, unlike attempt, which was generally considered less serious. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from the dismissal by the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) of an indictment charging two defendants with multiple counts of promotion of gambling, a felony, in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3303, based upon a trial court finding that &sect; 13-3303 was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court dismissed defendants' indictment for multiple counts of felony promotion of gambling, violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3303, as void for vagueness, the State challenged the trial court's conclusion that &sect; 13-3303 was unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 13-3303 was not unconstitutionally vague even though &sect; 13-3301(1) did not define the phrase &quot;control to any material degree&quot; with respect to amusement gambling, and &sect; 13-3301(6) did not define the phrases &quot;conducted as a business&quot; and &quot;compete on equal terms&quot; with respect to social gambling. The court determined that the phrases in question were to be given their ordinary meaning and therefore gave defendants fair notice of the conduct that was prohibited. The court concluded that a person of ordinary intelligence was capable of understanding the meaning of the phrases in question. Accordingly, the court vacated the dismissal of defendants' gambling indictment because &sect; 13-3303 was not unconstitutionally vague. The matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged orders of the City Court of Tucson, in the State of Arizona, County of Pima, which denied their motions to dismiss on the grounds that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692(A)(2) (1990) was unconstitutional. Defendants were charged with violating &sect; 28-692(A)(2), which prohibited a person from having a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.10 percent or more within two hours of driving or being in actual physical control of the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that &sect; 28-692 was unconstitutional because it reallocated the burden of proof on defendant by labeling as an affirmative defense, not having a BAC of 0.10 percent at the time of driving, an element of the crime that was in a previous statute. The court found that &sect; 28-692 had created a new crime and was not unconstitutional simply because it did not contain the same elements of the statute it replaced. The court found that &sect; 28-692 raised no impermissible presumption that one who had a BAC of 0.10 percent within two hours of operating a motor vehicle also had a blood alcohol content of 0.10 percent at the time he operated a motor vehicle. The court found that the statute was violated by having the requisite BAC not only at the time of operating the motor vehicle but also within two hours thereafter. The court also rejected the argument that the statute impermissibly shifted the burden of proof by requiring defendant to prove facts that were more easily demonstrated by the state. The court affirmed and concluded that &sect; 28-692 was not overbroad because the state had a compelling interest in reducing the terrible toll of life and limb on the state's highways.</SPAN></P>

The Arizona Legislature, by decriminalizing numerous traffic offenses, determined as a matter of public policy that those offenses were not as morally reprehensible as criminal acts.

Defendant was found guilty, and the superior court affirmed the conviction. On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 13-2907.01 was unconstitutionally vague and overly broad. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found that &sect; 13-2907.01 provided reasonable persons of average intelligence with notice of the specific conduct it proscribed. Moreover, the class of people who could have been prosecuted under the statute was narrowly drawn and not overly broad. Only those persons providing the kind of information set forth in the statute with the requisite knowledge or purpose could have been found in violation of the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant regularly engaged in sexual conduct with his minor daughter.

On the other charge, the trial court suspended imposition of sentence and imposed a concurrent probationary term of seven years. As a term of probation, the trial court required defendant to register as a sex offender pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3821. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that: (1) the trial court properly convicted and sentenced defendant on two counts of sexual conduct with a minor, as evidence sufficiently established two separate acts by defendant; (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in the sentences imposed; (3) &sect; 13-3821 was regulatory rather than penal in nature; and (4) the trial court did not have a responsibility to inform defendant of the registration requirement before accepting his plea, because it was not a condition of the sentence imposed but an independent statutory requirement.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment for appellees and denied a motion for a new trial. The court affirmed the trial court judgment, holding that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-462.02 was permissive and that appellees were not limited to using purchase or condemnation to remove nonconforming uses and structures. Because under the ordinance the city could consider a parcel of land as an integrated whole, any change to part of the property was considered a change to the existing property. The statute, however, protected only existing property which remained unchanged or received only reasonable repairs or alterations. The court also ruled that because there was a direct relationship between the purposes for regulating signs and the required removal of a nonconforming sign, the condition did not constitute a taking.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employer sought a special action after the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) that held him in contempt of court and assessed a fine as a penalty for the employer's failure to obey the trial court's order of wage assignment for child support payments pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2454.01 that was served on the employer by respondent state (Attorney General).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found the claims of error without merit, but on its own motion, ordered the Attorney General's filing of a brief addressing the issue of whether the trial court had followed proper procedures in assessing the penalty for contempt of court. Upon filing the brief, the Attorney General confessed error. The court held that the trial judge erred in fining the owner as a penalty for failing to honor a wage assignment for the employee's child support payments. The court found that the trial court treated the owner's disobedience of the order as a criminal contempt of court without affording the owner the rights and safeguards provided for by the Arizona Rules of Criminal Procedure (Rules). The court ruled that insofar as the owner was fined without regard to the Rules, the employer was correct that the Valentine's Day Roundup conducted by the domestic relations divisions resulted in Constitutional violations. The court vacated the fine and ruled that the fine, in the nature of a criminal penalty, was also improper because the employer had not waived a trial by jury, which was required pursuant to Ariz. R. Crim. P. &sect; 33.4(a) in order to have properly assessed such a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, accepting jurisdiction, granted relief in part by vacating the fine in favor of the employer, and denied in part by finding all other claims for relief meritless in favor of the state in the employer's special action after having been held in contempt of court.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Mohave County (Arizona) set aside the board's decision requiring that the owner reconstruct the sign. All parties sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's parcel of real property in the city was located close to where a highway and an interstate intersected.

On appeal, the court held that no reconstruction was required. The court held that: (1) the sign ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague; (2) the board did not abuse its discretion in how it interpreted the ordinance; (3) the owner did not waive his right to assert that he had acquired a vested right in the sign; (4) the trial court did not err in conducting a trial on the vested right issue; and (5) the evidence supported the owner's right in the sign under principles of equitable estoppel rather than vested rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had denied the inmate's petition for post-conviction relief without providing the inmate with an evidentiary hearing. The court remanded for an evidentiary hearing. Even though the inmate's sentence had been previously affirmed on appeal, he could attack the validity of the sentencing proceedings pursuant to Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32. The inmate met the requirements of Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32.1(e) that permitted securing relief upon newly-discovered material fact that if it existed at the time of sentencing could have affected that determination. The inmate's claim that he had human immunodeficiency virus constituted a colorable claim of newly discovered material fact because he was not diagnosed until after sentencing, he was diligent in bringing the evidence to the trial court's attention, that evidence was not cumulative or impeaching, and it was relevant because an inmate's health was a factor considered at sentencing. If the inmate had the virus at the time of sentencing, the trial court at the hearing could exercise its discretion to allow the state or the inmate to withdraw from the stipulated sentences in the plea agreements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Cruz County (Arizona), adjudicating their two minor children dependent and placing them in the custody of the Department of Economic Security (DES). The parents contended on appeal that they were denied due process because there was no cross-examination of the children, and counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the court interviewing the children absent counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children were 14-year-old stepbrothers, one the father's son, and one the mother's son. When they were nine, the boys started a spree of doing property damage and running away, telling DES workers that they had been beaten. Finally, the parents asked not to have the children returned to them when a voluntary placement ended, and DES filed a dependency petition. The children did not testify in court but were interviewed by the trial judge in chambers. The trial court found that the parents were not able to care for the children at the time and that the children would just again run away again if returned and be subject to danger. The court affirmed, rejecting the parents' argument that they should have been allowed to cross-examine the children. Given that neither child was called as a witness by the parents, although the possibility was discussed by counsel, it was clear that any objection to the trial judge's in-chambers interviews was waived by both counsel and the parents. The right to cross-examine the children was never refused, and therefore no due process right was violated, because the opportunity to exercise that right was never requested.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 32-1296 required that in order to take an examination to be certified to practice denture technology, applicants had to have a diploma in denture technology granted by a school accredited by the Board. The trial court declared that portion of the statute to be unconstitutional and severable. On appeal, the court vacated the trial court's order and remanded the action with directions to enter judgment for the Board. The court held that the legislature permitted a rationally defined class of persons to take the licensure examination upon successful completion of a curriculum which met the requirements of the statute and was accredited by the Board. The procedure was rationally related to a legitimate legislative purpose, specifically, permitting qualified persons to become licensed during the interim in which it was presumably anticipated that institutions offering programs in denture technology would become accredited by the Board. The fact that the anticipated condition did not subsequently materialize did not render the temporary licensing provision a form of special legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3408(A)(7) was unconstitutional because it impinged upon the federal government's exclusive domain of regulating foreign commerce. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, the evidence at trial established that defendant took cocaine into Mexico and then re-entered Arizona with the cocaine. Upon re-entry into the United States, he was detained at a border inspection station, where it was discovered that he possessed 1.8 grams of cocaine. Defendant argued that &sect; 13-3408(A)(7) that prohibited the importation of cocaine violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3 because the federal government had exclusive and plenary power over foreign commerce and that any attempt by a state to regulate foreign commerce was unconstitutional. Defendant also claimed that the Arizona statute punished importation more severely than its federal counterpart. The court found that Arizona's importation statute was even-handed and prohibited any importation of illegal drugs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for possession of marijuana for sale and production of marijuana involving more than eight pounds, and the court affirmed. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3405(C) imposed stricter penalties on those convicted of offenses involving more than eight pounds of marijuana. At trial, the marijuana seized was very dry and weighed 6.93 pounds, and an expert testified that wet marijuana weighed one-third more than dry. The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for acquittal because there was sufficient evidence to show that at the time of its seizure, the marijuana found weighed more than eight pounds. The court further found that a rational basis existed for the legislature's classification based on the weight of marijuana at the time it was seized, so the law was not unconstitutional. The eight-pound quantity, be it wet or dry marijuana, was enough to support the legislative assumption that a defendant was not possessing the marijuana for personal use. Thus, &sect; 13-3405(C) clearly and rationally served a legitimate state objective of preventing the distribution of an illegal drug.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted of driving while her driver's license was suspended. The court held that the appellate court erred when it reversed the defendant's conviction. The court held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-110(F) was valid because it supplemented the Arizona Rules of Evidence and did not conflict with Ariz. R. Evid. 901 or 902. The court held that Ariz. R. Evid. 902 provided that certain documents were self-authenticating where such authenticity was presumed by statute and that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-110(F) was an example of such a statute. The court held that the fact that the defendant's driving record was computer generated and contained a printed facsimile of the record custodian's signature did not render the record inadmissible because &sect; 28-110(F) did not require human involvement and absent contrary evidence, the trial court was entitled to presume that the facsimile signature of a state officer was valid. The court held that the driving record at issue was an original and not a copy pursuant to Ariz. R. Evid. 1001(3).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's expert witness prepared a report indicating that if the driver had taken a Breath Intoxilyzer Test contemporaneously with his arrest, rather than one hour later, his blood alcohol level (BAC) would have been below both the .10 found by the police and the .096 found by the expert's independent testing. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment affirming the administrative order suspending the driver's license. The court held that the administrative hearing officer correctly disregarded the extrapolation evidence presented by the expert because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-694 required that a driver's BAC be .10 or more at the time of a test, not at the time he or she was driving. In addition, the court stated that it could not construe &sect; 28-694 as unconstitutional based on hypothetical examples presented by the driver, which did not apply to the case. Lastly, the court also stated that the driver's argument, that Arizona should have required that the operator of a breath testing device perform control tests before and after the driver took the breath test, should have been addressed to the Arizona legislature and not to the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was involved in an automobile accident and given field sobriety tests and a blood alcohol test. His blood alcohol was above the legal limits and he was required to surrender his driver's license. After an administrative hearing, the hearing officer sustained the order suspending his license. The trial court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-694 required that the blood alcohol content had to be above the legal limit at the time of the test without regard to the projected reading at the time of driving. The statute was reasonably related to the legislative end of removing people who drink and drive from the roads. The statute was also not void for vagueness because it clearly gave notice that a driver faced suspension of driving privileges when he drank enough alcohol while driving to exceed the legal blood alcohol limit. A driver's license did not give rise to a constitutionally protected property interest and the administrative hearing complied with due process requirements. The right to drive was not a fundamental right and the statute was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued, inter alia, that a felony-murder charge could not be predicated on an assault, that several of the state's witnesses violated a pretrial ruling prohibiting reference to his prior misconduct, and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The court affirmed the trial court's judgments and sentences. The court reasoned that although an assault which resulted in a death would not itself warrant a felony-murder charge, remaining unlawfully in a residence with the intent to commit an assault constituted a burglary and might warrant a felony-murder charge. The court concluded that appellant was properly charged with the murders of two victims because their deaths clearly occurred either during the burglary or during immediate flight therefrom. The court reasoned that an isolated remark by a detective could not have had such a prejudicial effect that a mistrial was the only remedy to preserve appellant's right to a fair trial. The court concluded that counsels' conduct did not result in the failure to preserve favorable pretrial rulings and that their trial performance was consonant with Sixth Amendment standards pertaining to effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was an incorporated, non-profit cooperative association. The court found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-176(F) overruled Yavapai County v. Wilkinson, 111 Ariz. 530, 534 P.2d 735 (1975), so the department was not collaterally estopped by its failure to appeal an earlier tax-year decision of the State Board of Tax Appeals, which found that the taxpayer had class four status. The court held that &sect; 42-176(F) did not abrogate or limit the doctrine of collateral estoppel. The court found that the taxpayer's member-owners jointly devoted the property to their collective commercial use through the taxpayer instrumentality. The court concluded that the taxpayer, though organized as a non-profit entity, devoted its property to a commercial use, and this use determined the propriety of a class three commercial designation under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-162(A)(3). The court found that an affidavit and an attached table did not demonstrate that any properties used similarly to the taxpayer's had been designated as class four; therefore, the evidence failed to support its claim of discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was convicted and sentenced for escape. At trial, he had argued that his escape was justified because he was under duress of threats on his life. Petitioner sought post-conviction relief because the trial court gave a jury instruction on justification that was later declared unconstitutional. He appealed an order of the Superior Court of Pinal County (Arizona), which summarily dismissed his petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged jury instruction told the jury that it must find petitioner not guilty if the jury decided that his conduct was justified. After petitioner's conviction, the Arizona Supreme Court held that the giving of the instruction was fundamental error because the instruction could have been erroneously interpreted by the jury as shifting the burden of proof to a defendant. The trial court decided that the Arizona Supreme Court's holding did not require that petitioner be given a new trial, and the court agreed on appeal. The defense of duress was not specifically set forth in the statute defining escape, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2503, or in the section of the criminal code on justifications, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-401 et seq. Public policy considerations required a more stringent standard of duress when applied to the crime of escape. Petitioner had the burden to establish duress, an affirmative defense, by a preponderance of the evidence. The court found that the giving of the instruction was not fundamental error. Any objection to the instruction was waived by petitioner's failure to raise it on direct appeal. Further, any error related to the instruction was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted review of the trial court's order, which had dismissed the petition. The court, however, denied post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested in possession of 232 pounds of marijuana. Defendant was indicted on one count each of possession of marijuana, possession of marijuana for sale, and transportation of marijuana for sale. Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant entered a plea of guilty to possession for sale of marijuana in excess of eight pounds. Defendant was sentenced and ordered to pay a mandatory fine plus a surcharge. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the fine provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3405 did not violate the state and federal prohibitions against excessive fines because the problem of drug use and sale was one of the most serious problems confronting society. The court further held that the issue of defendant's ability to pay was only relevant in consideration of a particular payment plan. The court concluded that defendant's ability to pay was not before the court.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 13-2503. He admitted two prior felony convictions and was sentenced to the presumptive term of five years' imprisonment, to be served consecutively with the sentences he was serving. The trial court denied his post-conviction petition or relief. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court declined to adopt as a constitutional imperative that the State had to disprove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact constituting affirmative defenses related to the culpability of the accused. Due process required the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements included in the definition of the offense of which a defendant was charged. Proof of the nonexistence of all affirmative defenses was not constitutionally required. The defense of duress was, in actuality, an affirmative defense. It was not an element of the crime of escape as defined in &sect; 13-2503. Because there was no fundamental error, any objection to the duress instruction was waived by the inmate's failure to raise it on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion, and the jury found defendant guilty. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant's license was revoked because a record of his moving violations that was introduced at trial showed a revocation, and there was no indication on the document that the license had been reissued. The court also pointed to the evidence that defendant was only able to produce an identification-only card when he was stopped by the police officer rather than a driver's license. A revocation was of indefinite duration, and because of that the court held that the jury could have reasonably inferred that the revocation remained in effect when the offense occurred.</SPAN></P>

Upon affirming the order, the court held:(1) that the registrar's order was a restitutionary remedy that was contemplated by the legislature as part of its authority to take appropriate disciplinary action against those who violated licensing standards; (2) that the administrative award of damages was constitutional because the seller's due process procedural rights were protected, prohibited conduct was well defined by the governing statute, and judicial review was available; (3) that there was no abuse of discretion in permitting the purchaser's claim to go forward, and (4) that there was substantial evidence in the available transcript to enable a meaningful judicial review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The revenue department issued transaction privilege tax assessments to the taxpayer calculated on the taxpayer's sales of video games to video arcades and other businesses. The taxpayer paid the amount owed under protest and then brought an action for recovery of the amount paid pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-124(B)(2).

The trial court denied the revenue department's motion for summary judgment and its motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case. The court held that video game machines were &quot;games&quot; under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-1314(A)(1). The court determined that the taxpayer had therefore made &quot;sales at retail&quot; and was liable for the transaction privilege tax under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-1312(A). The court also found that the taxation of the proceeds from video game machines under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-1314(A)(1) did not constitute double taxation and did not violate Ariz.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her conviction by the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) for possession of a dangerous drug, a class four felony or class one misdemeanor under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3407(B)(1) (1988). Defendant challenged that portion of &sect; 13-3407(B)(1) that conditioned the redesignation of the offense as a misdemeanor on a &quot;motion of the State,&quot; arguing violation of the separation of powers and of Ariz. Const. art. III.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was indicted, she pled not guilty and proceeded to jury trial. At trial, the State presented evidence that the police had discovered a syringe and a small plastic bag containing a white powdery substance in defendant's purse during an inventory search following her arrest. After conviction but prior to sentencing, defendant moved for a new trial on the grounds of newly discovered evidence. The trial court denied the motion, and the matter was set for a mitigation hearing. Defendant then filed a motion invoking &sect; 13-3407(B) and asking the trial court to designate the conviction a misdemeanor. The State had not filed the statutorily required motion, but defendant contended that requiring the State's motion was unconstitutional, claiming that designation of the offense as a felony or misdemeanor was an exclusively judicial function. The trial court denied defendant's motion to redesignate and sentenced her as for a felony, but the court reversed. Because &sect; 13-3407(B) limited the exclusively judicial function of sentencing, it was unconstitutional under Ariz. Const. art. III. Further, the offensive portion of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3407(B) (1988) was severable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the conviction as a class four felony and the sentence imposed thereon. The matter was remanded for the trial court to consider whether the nature and circumstances of the offense warranted the entry of the judgment of conviction as a class one misdemeanor rather than as a class four felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions of unlawful flight from a law enforcement vehicle, aggravated assault, and criminal damage. Defendant was observed committing a traffic violation and was asked to stop his motorcycle. After defendant stopped, after his initial flee, an officer told him that he would blow him away. Defendant argued that the court erred by not allowing defendant to present a justification defense to the jury for the aggravated assault and criminal damage charges arguing that he fled from the officer the second time because he feared for his life based on the officer's comment. When threatened by inappropriate deadly force by an officer a suspect like defendant could fear its use and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-404(B) created a limited right for members of the public to resist excessive police force. The instructions requested by defendant should have been given regarding defendant's right to take action to avoid excessive force; therefore, the aggravated assault and criminal damage convictions were reversed, however, the unlawful flight conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pled guilty to two counts of attempted sexual assault, the trial court ordered defendant to register as a sex offender pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3821. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found that &sect; 13-3821 was intended to apply to attempted offenses because an attempt to commit an offense was more than preparatory, it was a punishable segment of the crime intended. The court noted defendant was not convicted of committing an attempt, but rather he was convicted of attempting to commit the substantive offense of sexual assault. The court held that &sect; 13-3821 was not vague where both statutory and case law recognized that an attempt to commit an offense is a lesser-included offense within the completed offense. The court concluded the sentence requiring defendant for his lifetime to register as a sex offender was not excessive punishment where the crimes committed were egregious, the sentence was not disproportionate to other sentences imposed, and other jurisdictions had similar sex offender statutes. The court noted defendant had sexually assaulted a mother and her 17-year-old daughter in their own home after he gained entry by using a knife.</SPAN></P>

After a hearing, the superior court declared the homeowner's homestead exemption null and void, and ordered the forfeiture. The homeowner appealed. The court affirmed. The court rejected the double punishment argument of the homeowner because the forfeiture provision of &sect; 13-2314 served the purpose of removing from the homeowner the means to commit further offenses and helped the state defray expenses of investigation and prosecution, which made the provision remedial. The state's forfeiture complaint was not required to allege any injury from the predicate offense or to prove any injury.

Defendant failed to meet any criteria creating a right to a jury. Defendant's fines totalled less than $ 500, and the license suspension was insufficient added punishment to make the crimes serious. Driving was a privilege, and the loss of the privilege was not as serious as the loss of a right. License suspension was a civil sanction, not a criminal sanction, and defendant's maximum exposure to a prison sentence was insufficient to trigger a jury. Traffic violations in themselves did not brand a person as depraved and inherently base or reflect on personal values.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the trial court's ruling that an act of public sexual indecency could not be committed in a home and its dismissal of the charges brought against defendant. On review, the court disagreed. The legislature referred to the crime as public sexual indecency. Yet, the statute tracked the indecent exposure language of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1402, in that another person must be present and that defendant must be reckless about whether such person, as a reasonable person, would be offended or alarmed by the act. It was therefore clear that public sexual indecency under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1403 could be committed in one's own home. It was a question of fact whether an actor by his conduct knowingly exposed his activity to another and was reckless about whether such other would reasonably be offended or alarmed by such activity. Any constitutional considerations concerning the right to privacy and consensual acts in the home were guarded by the standard of reasonableness and the requirement that the actor must be reckless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A woman accompanied her husband to defendant's trailer, where the husband purchased marijuana. The woman subsequently informed the police, and an officer submitted an affidavit for a search warrant based on the information provided by the woman. A search warrant was issued and executed, and marijuana, firearms, and other items were seized. The trial court found that the warrant was based upon stale information. However, the trial court applied Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3925, the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, and denied defendant's motion to suppress. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 13-3925 did not violate the rule-making authority of the Arizona Supreme Court or the constitutional principles of separation of powers. The court further held that the trial did not abuse its discretion in finding that the officers relied on the warrant in good faith. Defendant failed to specify why the officer's affidavit was insufficient under the totality of the circumstances. Moreover, citizen informants were presumed to be reliable. Although the affidavit mistakenly identified the name of the trailer park where defendant lived, it was sufficient to identify the place to be searched.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated and agreed to submit to a breathalyzer test. On two tries the machine indicated that it received a deficient sample due to defendant's failure to blow hard enough; the second sample, however, yielded a blood alcohol content (BAC) above the legal limit. A Motor Vehicle Division hearing officer suspended defendant's driver's license pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-691, and the superior court affirmed. On appeal, defendant contended that her license should not have been suspended because the purpose of &sect; 28-691 was satisfied both by her second test result and by her admission before taking the test that she was drunk and further that the law required that her refusal be willful. The court affirmed the suspension. It held that the hearing officer did not abuse his discretion in finding that defendant's failure to successfully complete the breathalyzer test constituted refusal. The court reasoned that compliance with &sect; 28-691 was necessary even though the test provided prosecutors with a BAC reading high enough to demonstrate her intoxication and further that refusal to take the test did not need to be evidenced by a willful act.</SPAN></P>

The proceedings had been initiated by the government after her infant son was taken to the hospital with first- and second-degree burns, other injuries, and an infection. On appeal, the court ruled that the statements and conclusions of the properly qualified medical expert regarding sexual abuse were admissible under Ariz. R. Evid. 803(4). The court determined that the trial court did not err in adjudicating the children dependent under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-201(11), which defined a dependent child as one who was not provided with a home or suitable place of abode, or whose home was unfit for him by reason of abuse, neglect, cruelty, or depravity by either of his parents or other person having his custody or care. The court ruled that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court's finding of dependency predicated on the mother's failure to prevent abuse by the father. The court noted that it followed that a finding of dependency was proper where the mother refused even to acknowledge past abuse. The court affirmed the juvenile court order.</SPAN></P>

The court found that discipline for failure to report a controlled substance theft was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. The court found substantial evidence that medication was unjustifiably given without doctors' orders, chart entries were inadequate, and preprinted forms were not standing orders when doctors did not fill in the blanks.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence of life imprisonment. On review, the court affirmed and held that that the trial court did not err in refusing to admit a departmental report of the crime in question. The report was irrelevant and defendant was not able to demonstrate how he was prejudiced by the court's refusal to admit it. Moreover, defendant's sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Ariz. Const. art 2, &sect; 15. The harshness of the penalty, life imprisonment, could not be considered solely in relation to the sale of a $ 20 rock of cocaine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the judge erroneously concluded that Ariz. Rev.

The court held that a reasonable construction of &sect; 12-822(B) showed that it was not intended to include actions seeking judicial review of administrative rulings, especially in light of a separate article that dealt specifically with such proceedings. The court found that the judge also erred in considering Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-401(16), which required that actions against public officers be brought in the county in which they held office. Although the director was a public officer, an administrative appeal was not an action against a public officer just as it was not an action against the state. Additionally, the more specific provision of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-905 was controlling and the action was properly brought under its requirements. The court vacated the order that granted the venue change because the judge exceeded his legal authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The disabled veterans were denied a veterans' tax exemption because they were not residents of Arizona before September 1, 1945, or for a total of four years prior to their induction or enlistment in the United States Armed Forces. They filed suit to determine if the residence requirements were severable. The trial court found that the requirements were not severable and that the tax exemptions were invalid because the residency requirements violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The veterans appealed, contending that the residency requirements were severable. The court disagreed, holding that the requirements could not be severed from the remaining provisions for veterans' exemption because the remaining provisions would no longer reflect the intent of the voters who approved the constitutional amendment by referendum. It was apparent that the voters would not have voted in favor of the veterans' tax exemptions without the restrictive residency requirements contained in each amendment. In determining that question, the court considered the context, the language, the subject matter, the background, the effects and consequences, and the purpose of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issues were whether the director was protected by immunity and whether the applicants' failure to exhaust state administrative remedies barred their claims. The court held that: (1) the defense of qualified immunity based on the director's objectively reasonable reliance on clearly established law was a personal one that was unavailable to him because the applicants had proceeded against the director in his official capacity; (2) the applicants were not required to exhaust state administrative remedies before bringing their 42 U.S.C.S. 1983 claims in federal court; (3) the applicants' &sect; 1983 claims were not subject to dismissal by virtue of the absolute or qualified executive immunity created by Ariz.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was arrested for delinquent behavior. He was detained for five days before the trial court advised him of the charges against him and held an initial hearing. At the hearing, the trial court found that there was reasonable cause to continue the juvenile's detention pending adjudication. The juvenile filed a special action challenging the constitutionality of Rule 3. On review, the court determined that Rule 3 required the state to take the juvenile before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest, but that Rule 3(d) excluded Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays from the 24-hour period. The court held that Rule 3(d) was unconstitutional on equal protection grounds because it treated juvenile offenders differently than adult offenders, and there was no rational basis for the disparate treatment. The court ruled that the &quot;reasonable cause&quot; standard of proof imposed by Rule 3(b) to determine whether a juvenile should be detained pending adjudication was not a violation of the juvenile's due process rights because &quot;reasonable cause&quot; meant &quot;probable cause.&quot; The court held that the trial court was not constitutionally required to make specific findings of fact pursuant to Rule 3(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the subsection of the juvenile rule excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays from the 24-hour period that juveniles could be detained without being taken before a magistrate was unconstitutional. The court held that the remainder of the rule was constitutional. The court denied relief to the juvenile because the matter had become moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, voters and concerned citizens (citizens), sought review of an order of the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona), which granted summary judgments against the citizens in their action seeking to compel appellees, the mayor, city council, and city, to call a referendum election on the alignment of a proposed parkway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens filed a complaint against the mayor, city council, and city, seeking an order requiring the city council to hold a referendum election on the proposed alignment of the parkway pursuant to the Neighborhood Protection Amendment to Tucson, Ariz., Charter, ch. XXV, &sect; 13. The state and a group of individual voters intervened. The trial court granted appellees' motions for summary judgment. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that Arizona law preempted the city from legislating on the matter because: (1) the alignment and construction of the parkway was a subject of statewide concern where the parkway lay both inside and outside a city, the parkway was to be funded by state highway revenue user funds, and the state transportation board established the parkway as a state route and approved the alignment before the Neighborhood Protection Amendment became effective; (2) state legislation appropriated the subject under the provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 28-104, -1801(9), -106(B); and (3) once the parkway was established as a state route, the city lost authority to legislate on the matter and the city voters lost authority to seek a referendum election on it.</SPAN></P>
