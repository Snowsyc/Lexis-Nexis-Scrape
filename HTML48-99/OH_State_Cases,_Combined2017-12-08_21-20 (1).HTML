<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The matter was before the court on the petition of plaintiffs, members of a religious society, seeking a permanent injunction restraining defendants, religious society's president and board of trustees, from turning over to another religious caucus real estate and other assets, including endowments, owned by the religious society.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The religious society owned property consisting of a church edifice and land and had accumulated substantial assets for the purposes set forth in the society's Code of Regulations. The members alleged that defendants, in disregard of the regulations held meetings at which they adopted resolutions relating to the disposition of the assets by transfer to another religious society. The members claimed that the resolutions were adopted by less than a majority of the membership, and sought an injunction. Defendants claimed that the court lacked jurisdiction because the First Amendment barred judicial intervention into the society's religious affairs, and sought dismissal of the petition. The court held that it had jurisdiction because the issues presented did not raise ecclesiastical questions which would automatically bar the court from taking jurisdiction. The court further found that the conditions precedent regarding the call and conduct of the special membership meetings in question were satisfied, and that there was no change of name, change of location, or termination of the operation requiring a two-thirds vote of the membership. Therefore, the court dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>

The court found that it was not permitted to reverse the Board's decision on the continuance application absent proof that the Board abused its discretion. Further, the court determined that, if counsel was present at the administrative hearing and failed to object to testimony that was not given under oath, any right to appeal was waived by the failure to preserve the error for review. The court found that the appellate agency was only required to proceed with hearing matters that were properly appealed to it.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The chiropractor filed a claim with the Board for a license contending that he was entitled to one on his reciprocal rights because he was licensed in another jurisdiction. The Board denied the chiropractor's claim, and the chiropractor sought review contending that the Board lacked the authority to regulate his profession and determine whether he was entitled to a license. The court found that the practice of medicine included chiropractic branches. The court further found that, because chiropractic branches were part of the healing arts, they were subject to regulation by the state. The court determined that the legislature was given wide discretion in regulating the public health. The court found that the legislature's creation of the Board to examine and register persons desiring to practice medicine in the state, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4731.15 was constitutional and was a valid exercise of its legislative power. The court further found that the Board was entitled to follow the state standards and was not required to give anyone reciprocity from another state. The court affirmed the Board's ruling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged with violating &sect; 901-C2 of the Ordinances of the City of Cincinnati for distributing pamphlets within 100 feet of the entrance of a High School. Defendants filed demurrers to the affidavits filed by the police officers claiming that the affidavits were insufficient in charging an unlawful act in violation of the city ordinance. Defendants also claimed the city ordinance was unconstitutional. The court sustained defendants' demurrers and concluded that the affidavits did not sufficiently charge an unlawful act. The court ruled that the ordinance was an all encompassing law that failed to describe, at least, what literature was annoying to the distributee or whether the voluntary acceptance by the distributee would constitute an unlawful act on the part of the distributor. The court held that the city ordinance was unconstitutional as abridging the freedom of speech and press since the law was restrictive as to the place and time that a person could distribute literature. Defendants' liberty of expression in appropriate places could not be abridged on the city's plea that it could be exercised in some other place.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Auditor and the Board evaluated the property owner's real estate and determined that the property had been overassessed for tax purposes. The Board reduced the assessed valuation, and the property owners sought review contending that the Auditor lacked the authority to make the reassessment. The court held that the Auditor only possessed such power as was conferred by statute and any implied powers that were necessary to put the statute into effect. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5713.01, the Auditor was permitted to decrease or increase the value of any lot or parcel of real estate so that every class of real property was listed for valuation by an equal and uniform rule. Further, when the Auditor reassessed a class of property, the court determined that he was required to notify the owners by mail at least 30 days prior to the issuance of the tax bill. The court found that, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5715.19, the Board was then authorized the hear and render its decision on the owners' complaint within 90 days. The court held that the assessment was uniform and in accordance with Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 2. The court granted judgment in favor of the Auditor and the Board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff non-union city employees brought a class action suit against defendants, a city, a union, and union officials, to enjoin the enforcement of a collective bargaining provision for the mandatory payment of union dues or agency shop fees from all city civil service employees. The non-union city employees also sought a declaratory judgment that certain provisions of the agreement were unconstitutional, invalid, and illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city and the union entered into a collective bargaining agreement that required the city to withhold union dues or agency shop fees from all city civil service employees irrespective as to whether the employee was a member of the union. The agreement provided for disciplinary action, including suspension and termination of employment, for an employee's failure to authorize the withholding of union dues. The court held that the non-union city employees did not have any adequate remedy at law and that the court had equitable jurisdiction over the action. The court held that the collective bargaining agreement provision as to union dues was ultra vires and invalid. The provision was an exercise of the city's police power that directly conflicted with the general laws of Ohio and that did not accomplish a governmental, public, or municipal purpose. The court permanently enjoined the city and the union from enforcing the agreement's provision as to dues or agency shop fees.</SPAN></P>

The court permanently enjoined the union and the union officials from any activity intended to induce the city to comply with the terms of the agency shop provisions.</SPAN></P>

The prosecutor made clear his intent to confiscate the film after the first showing upon a determination that the film was obscene. The producer filed a petition seeking a permanent injunction preventing the prosecutor from confiscating the film. The court ruled that there must be a prior judicial determination in an adversary proceeding of obscenity material in order to obtain a valid restraining order. Further, the court held that state regulations with relation to the question of obscenity must conform to procedure that insured against the curtailment of the constitutionally protected expression which was often separated from obscenity by a thin and uncertain line. The court ordered a hearing to address the issue of the film's obscenity, concluding that there was a legitimate dispute involving the question of obscenity of the movie and that a confiscation of the same without a proper judicial hearing was in violation of established laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This cause is before the court for judicial review on the petition of respondent-plaintiff Sowers, the transcript of the record of the hearings before the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, the briefs of the parties, and the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Examination of the record herein and the evidence reveals that these proceedings were commenced by the filing of employment charge affidavits by complainants Rudolph Phillips and Eli Steigner on the 26th day of February, 1967, with the defendant herein, the Ohio Civil Rights Commission.  Phillips and Steigner, members of the Newton Falls Exempted Village Board of Education and, along with members Edward T. Harnish, Theodore Montgomery and Austin E. Sowers, respondent-plaintiff herein, constituted the entire membership of the board of education.  The affidavits charged respondent-plaintiff with voting against hiring one, Dr. Tobasco, as superintendent of schools because he was a Catholic and, that accordingly, said Dr. Tobasco was unlawfully discriminated against because of his religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears that at the end of the school year, in the spring of 1966, the resignation of the then superintendent of schools necessitated action on the part of the board&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of education to find a successor.  The investigation conducted by defendant-commission's field director Lieb acknowledged the board's requirements for the position of superintendent, at that time, to be:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. Age -- between 35 and 55 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. A maximum salary of $ 12,000.00 per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. Experience as a superintendent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it appears further that from a total of forty applicants, the field was narrowed to five by the board for the purposes of interview.  No formal application was ever filed by Dr. Tobasco, nevertheless, in addition to the five, he was interviewed on August 19, 1966, &quot;as a courtesy to him because we (the board) had been criticized for not interviewing him previously.&quot; At that time he did not have a superintendent's certificate as required by Section 3319.01, Revised Code.  Tobasco admitted that he had made no formal application for the position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testimony of respondent-plaintiff, uncontroverted of record, indicates that on the last Friday of 1966 (December 30th), prior to the January 2, 1967, organizational meeting of the board of education, board member Steigner telephoned the respondent-plaintiff requesting his vote for Steigner as president and Phillips as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  vice president of said board.  Respondent-plaintiff stated that he made no commitment, whereupon Steigner &quot;hung up&quot; and &quot;wasn't too pleased.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes of the organizational meeting, January 2, 1967, indicate that at such meeting (which was to be confined to the election of officers, administration of oath and employment of a clerk) a request by member Phillips to read a prepared statement concerning the right of one board member (respondent-plaintiff) to remain on said board after making statements in violation of Section 4112.02, Revised Code, was granted by president Steigner over a point of order raised by member Hornish.  Thereafter, Phillips moved that a resolution be adopted to investigate such violation.  Motion died for want of a second.  Phillips then moved that the meeting be adjourned.  Said motion also died for want of a second.  Thereafter, Phillips and Steigner excused themselves and left the meeting.  Following this action, Acting Superintendent Prescott (not a board member) who was present was asked to preside as temporary chairman.  The remaining three members proceeded to nominate and elect Montgomery as president and Sowers as vice president of said board of education. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On January 11, 1967, a further organizational meeting of the Newton Falls Board of Education was called to order by Steigner as a result of a ruling by the assistant prosecutor to the effect that neither candidate had been legally elected to the offices of president and vice president.  Thereupon Montgomery and Sowers were again nominated for the offices of president and vice president respectively, for the year 1967.  Said candidates were then elected by a vote of 3 ayes and 2 nays (Phillips and Steigner voting in the negative).  At the conclusion of other business Phillips moved, Steigner seconded, that a two-year contract be offered to Dr. Tobasco at a salary of $ 14,000 annually for the position of superintendent.  The vote on the motion, and in the order made, was as follows:</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, respondent-plaintiff read a prepared statement (in response to the January 2, 1967, statement made by Phillips) concerning his (Sowers') right to remain on the board because of unlawful discriminatory practices, in which statement of clarification&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (as he called it) he explained a statement he had previously made to the effect that he could not conscientiously vote for a Catholic as superintendent.  Following discussion concerning the right of member Sowers to serve on the board, Phillips moved, seconded by Steigner, to present a resolution to the Ohio School Boards Association to investigate the question of legal representation of member Sowers and to determine his right to stay on as a board member.  The motion failed for want of majority vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, on February 20, 1967, the board of education received a certified mail notice from regional director Hunter of the defendant-commission advising that employment charge affidavits had been received and that a preliminary investigation relative to the allegations contained therein would be commenced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By letter dated March 6, 1967, field representative Lieb of the defendant-commission, directed that the board at its March 8th meeting &quot;shall&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) Decide upon specific requirements for the position of superintendent;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) Upon acceptance by the commission of said requirements the board is to so advise each applicant;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) Advise each of the interviewed applicants that his application&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  will be reconsidered and those not meeting requirements so informed; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) Advise Tobasco of the board's regret for unlawful discriminatory statements made by one of its members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No action was taken by the board at the March 8th meeting with respect to defendant-commission's letter of March 6, 1967.  However, the board did move to abide by Section 4112.02, Revised Code, in all of its acts and not discriminate against any person.  Said motion passed by unanimous vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board further voted to adopt, pursuant to defendant-commission's directive, more specific qualifications for the position of superintendent.  By a vote of 3-2 (Phillips and Steigner voting in the negative) the following were adopted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Superintendent's certificate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Age 35-55 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Experience as superintendent, executive head or assistant superintendent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Salary $ 10,000.00-$ 12,000.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Two-year contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 11, 1967, the board of education mailed to defendant-commission a certified copy of the motion setting forth the specific qualifications for superintendent and of the resolution on nondiscrimination that were adopted at the March 8, 1967 meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By letter dated March 21, 1967, regional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  director Hunter of defendant-commission, notified board of education that the qualifications for superintendent decided upon at the March 8, 1967, meeting were acceptable with one exception -- namely, that the minimum length of experience desired must be clearly stated.  The commission further advised that it would expect a resume of each applicant, whether interviewed or not, and that said report must be submitted by Friday, March 24, 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, by letter dated April 5, 1967, regional director Hunter of defendant-commission, forwarded five guidelines for future school board action in the matter now under investigation:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The qualifications adopted March 8, 1967, by the board shall be accepted upon further clarification as to experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The board shall interview and consider all persons applying for the position of superintendent until employment of a candidate qualifying thereunder is accomplished or until June 5, 1967, whichever occurs first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. If the board fails to hire one of the candidates by June 5, 1967, the commission office shall presume the adopted standards have been unrealistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. If the board is unsuccessful in hiring by June 5, 1967, the regional office&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shall request the board to alter its standards to conform to the proposed qualifications prior to amendment at the March 8, 1967, board meeting, namely item 3 to read &quot;experience as administrator&quot; (as proposed by minority members Phillips and Steigner).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Failure of the board to comply with these requests will result in a recommendation of probable cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the board's regular meeting of April 10, 1967, moved by Phillips, seconded by Steigner, that member Sowers' right to cast a vote as recorded in the minutes of the meeting of March 8, 1967, designated Motion No. 13, Qualifications For Superintendent Candidate, be challenged.  Motion lost.  Three nays -- two ayes (Phillips and Steigner voting in the affirmative).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, by letter dated May 5, 1967, assistant prosecutor Ford submitted to the board of education, as a result of his meeting with regional director Hunter and compliance officer Gibb of the defendant-commission, his recommendations for a harmonious conclusion of the situation:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. That the guideline as to experience should be expressed in a generic sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That the board notify Tobasco that he would be given an opportunity to reapply under the new guidelines. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3. That separate biographical backgrounds of all candidates be prepared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. That extracts of board minutes be prepared pertaining to the discussions and actions involving guests for superintendent candidates and selection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the board's regular meeting held May 8, 1967, in accordance with the recommendations of the assistant prosecutor, it was moved by Harnish, seconded by Sowers, that Tobasco be informed of the guideline qualifications adopted at the March 8th meeting and that he further be informed of his eligibility to be considered for the position of superintendent without regard to race, religion, etc., provided he could qualify under the aforesaid guidelines.  The motion carried by a vote of 3-2 (Phillips and Steigner voting in the negative).  Whereupon, the clerk, by telephone and subsequently confirmed by letter dated May 8, 1967, so advised Dr. Tobasco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, in line with recommendations of the assistant prosecutor, it was moved by Harnish and seconded by Sowers, that the clerk be instructed to prepare resumes as suggested.  This motion carried by a vote of 3-2 (Phillips and Steigner again voting in the negative).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter moved by Phillips, seconded by Steigner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;To get in writing a challenge of the right to vote for Mr. Sowers; whether Mr. Sowers violated Section 4112.02, Revised Code.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motion lost due to lack of majority.  Two votes in the affirmative, Phillips and Steigner -- 3 votes in the negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By letter dated May 17, 1967, Tobasco was notified that his candidacy was being rejected for lack of experience in running an elementary school; in dealing with transportation and custodial problems; in teacher evaluation; in principal evaluation; in school building direction; and in dealing with boards of education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, at the regular adjourned meeting of the board on May 22, 1967, Richard C. Latture was hired as superintendent for a two-year period at a salary of $ 11,500 annually through July 31, 1967; $ 12,000 per year to August 1, 1968 and $ 12,500 to August 1, 1969.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the regular board meeting of July 10, 1967, on invitation, the representatives of defendant-commission, Gibb and Hunter, reported on the conciliatory efforts of the commission.  The board moved to make the report public and the representatives advised as to the necessary steps the board should take if the proposal was adopted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said proposal was made a part&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the minutes of the board and is as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Commission shall provide to Respondent, and Respondent shall distribute to their personnel, copies of the Commission's publication, Laws Against Discrimination, including Sections 4112.01 through 4112.08, Revised Code, administered by the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;II</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Respondent shall, within ten (10) days following notification to them of the Commission's acceptance of this CONCILIATION PROPOSALS, prepare and distribute a written statement of non-discriminatory policies to their employees and agents, including those whose duty it is to serve the public.  Said statement shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, a specific statement that neither Respondent nor their employees shall deny or limit the availability of Respondent's advantages, facilities, privileges, or services to any person, or otherwise discriminate against him, except for reasons applicable alike to all persons, regardless of race, color, religion, national origin or ancestry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;III</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Respondent shall, immediately upon the Commission's acceptance of this CONCILIATION PROPOSAL, take the following steps:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(1) Arrange a special meeting of the Newton Falls School Board&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  according to the laws governing such procedures (unless the date for a regularly scheduled Board meeting would occur first).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(2) During such meeting the Newton Falls School Board will proceed with the necessary measure (s) to remove Rev. Austin Sowers from membership on its body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;IV</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless otherwise provided herein, Respondent shall within ten (10) days following the effective date of this CONCILIATION PROPOSAL, forward to the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, 435 Perry-Payne Building, 740 Superior, N. W., Cleveland, Ohio 44113, copies of all correspondence carried out in compliance with Sections II and III of this CONCILIATION PROPOSAL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;V</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Commission shall make such compliance reviews as it believes to be warranted.  Respondent agrees to furnish whatever information is required by the Commission in order to implement such reviews.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the board meeting of July 17, 1967, a copy of the letter dated July 17, 1967, addressed to said board by the prosecuting attorney advising that the board had &quot;no power under the laws of this state to remove one of its members,&quot; was incorporated in the minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutor's letter advised further that inquiry had been made of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the defendant-commission &quot;as to the means by which the action of removal suggested by them might be accomplished and were advised that they were not prepared to advise or suggest any specific manner by which the board could remove Reverend Sowers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter the board adopted a conciliation proposal and forwarded a copy thereof to the defendant-commission.  The vote was 3-2 (Phillips and Steigner voting in the negative).  Said proposal was as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. To distribute to all school personnel copies of the Commission's publication, &quot;Laws Against Discrimination,&quot; to be obtained from the Commission, including Sections 4112.01 through 4112.08 and 4112.99, Revised Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. To distribute to all school employees and agents, within 10 days of the acceptance of this proposal by the Commission, written copies of the Board's policy of non-discrimination as adopted at the regular meeting of this board on March 8, 1967, and including the specific statements requested by the Commission in their proposal of conciliation presented to us at the meeting of July 10, 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. Inasmuch as we are, according to the legal advice given to us by the Prosecuting Attorney of Trumbull County, Ohio, legally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unable to comply with the Commission's request to remove Mr. Austin Sowers from membership on this board, we hereby, individually and collectively, express our complete opposition to the expression used by Mr. Sowers which, in the opinion of many citizens of our school district, indicates a discriminatory attitude; and we hereby censure Mr. Sowers for his unwise and unfortunate use of words, despite his later attempts to clarify them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. To hereby reaffirm our promise, individually and collectively, to comply with all provisions of State and Federal laws applying to non-discrimination in the operation of this school system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. To refrain, individually and collectively, from making any further statements or comments for public dissemination on the incident in question, except as may be required in a formal public hearing on this matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the foregoing proposal, compliance officer Gibb, of defendant-commission, replied by letter dated July 31, 1967, in which he advised that the defendant-commission had rejected the board's proposal and further stated that the commission's position is that employment activities of the board can not now, nor in the future be free of religious discrimination&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  so long as influenced by Sowers.  And further that no proposal that failed to provide for the elimination of Sowers' unlawful discriminatory influence will be acceptable to the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This letter and a revised conciliation proposal wherein Item III was changed to read:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;III</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Respondent Austin E. Sowers shall forthwith and hereafter exclude himself from and take no part in any discussion, motion, vote, or any other Board activity relating to hire, tenure, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, or any other matter directly or indirectly related to employment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were incorporated in the minutes of the board meeting of August 14, 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this amended proposal assistant prosecutor Ford replied by letter, dated August 3, 1967, advising that board would stand on their conciliation proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, September 3, 1968, defendant-commission issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order which are the subject of this appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is to be noted that while the Ohio Civil Rights Commission's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order, in Commission Case No. 70, were directed at both respondents Austin E. Sowers, individually, and Newton Falls Exempted Village&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  School Board of Education, the cause before this court for judicial review is limited to said document insofar as its provisions have application to, and may affect the individual rights of, the plaintiff-respondent herein, Austin E. Sowers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore the relevant provisions before this court for consideration are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Austin E. Sowers, on January 11, 1967, voted against hiring Dr. Tobasco as superintendent of the Newton Falls Exempted Village Schools because of religious discrimination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Austin E. Sowers engaged in an unlawful discriminatory practice in violation of Section 4112.02(A), Revised Code.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is ORDERED that Respondents Austin E.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff opposing member of a school board sought review of the order from defendant Ohio Civil Rights Commission, which found that the opposing member had discriminated against a candidate for school superintendent and ordered the opposing member to cease from further participation in employment decisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When a school board needed to hire a new superintendent, one member proposed a candidate (who was Catholic) who had unsuccessfully applied before. Another member (opposing member) expressed opposition to hiring a Catholic. Two other board members filed a complaint with the Commission against the opposing member. The Commission gave the board specific directions how to proceed in hiring the superintendent as part of its conciliation efforts. The candidate's application was rejected. The Commission then ordered the opposing member to stop taking part in the Board's employment decisions. The member challenged the Commission's actions. The court reversed the actions of the Commission. The court held that hiring the candidate would have been a prohibited action under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3319.01 because he did not have a superintendent's certificate. The Commission's &quot;conciliation proposals&quot; were not conciliatory at all as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4112.05(B) but were mandates. The Commission's findings of discrimination by the opposing member were not supported by the evidence. The Commission violated the opposing member's civil liberties of freedom of speech and religion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court set aside the Commission's finding that the complaining member committed an unlawful discriminatory practice and set aside the Commission's order prohibiting the complaining member from participation in employment decisions.</SPAN></P>

The court vacated the decision because the ordinance failed to provide standards or criteria for the guidance of the board and did not measure up to the constitutional requirements. The court held that the board was not acting upon any uniform rule of action and that in so far as use variances were concerned, the ordinance left the power of determining the same entirely to the will of the members of the board. Therefore, the board was without authority to grant the use &quot;variance&quot; requested because the action constituted an amendment to the use provisions of the ordinance, which was a function exclusively of the city council.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon. Because he had previously been convicted of a charge of burglary, defendant was convicted of a felony in accordance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.01. On appeal, defendant sought dismissal, alleging that &sect; 2923.01 was unconstitutional in that it imposed a greater penalty on him for a criminal conviction that occurred nine years before the statute was passed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court held that defendant's 1958 conviction for felony burglary was appropriately considered when he was arrested and convicted. The court found that a 1967 amendment to &sect; 2923.01 made it a felony to be convicted of carrying a concealed weapon if a criminal was previously convicted of one of the enumerated felonies prior to the law's effective date. The court found that after the effective date of the amendment to &sect; 2923.01, defendant was charged with carrying a concealed weapon. Under the statute, the court held that the latter crime became a felony by operation of law. Thus, the court held that defendant's conviction was constitutional and in accordance with Ohio law. Accordingly, the court overruled defendant's motion to dismiss and affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with violating the state's helmet law while riding a motorcycle. Defendant argued that &sect; 4511.53 was unconstitutional. The court sustained defendant's demurrer and held that &sect; 4511.53, insofar as it attempted to require motorcyclists to wear a protective helmet and protective eye devices, bore no real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare and was, therefore, beyond the police power of the State. The statute denied defendant liberty guaranteed to him under the Fourteenth Amendment and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court noted there was no real and substantial public danger that was alleviated by the statutory requirement of helmet and goggles, and that any legislative inhibition of individual liberty had to have been be supported by facts demonstrating a compelling public need. The law, therefore, was designed only for the protection of the individual motorcyclist. Whether or not a motorcyclist wore a helmet was a matter of concern solely to the individual involved and the State had no legitimate concern with whether or not defendant cracked his skull while motorcycling. That was his personal risk.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2923.04, moved to quash the indictment. An evidentiary hearing on the motion was held and counsel presented their arguments and briefs. Upon review, the court denied the motion to quash the indictment. The court found that the use of machine guns was one of public interest, affecting all classes of people, and was therefore properly the subject of legislative regulation and control. The court stated that the bond requirement of the statute was not directed against any one classification of persons, business, professions, or hobbies. The court concluded that the bond for the permit was in effect compulsory insurance for the exercise of the right to use such gun.

The court found that the precincts were not given the statutorily required minimum number of ballots. The precincts were required to have 10 per cent more ballots than were cast in the last general election. Because the term of office for governor was changed from two to four years, the number of ballots per precinct was based upon the most recent general election rather than upon the most recent election for governor. The court found that the ballot allocation should have been based upon the most recent election for governor.

The court held that the refusal of any test by defendant who was so influenced by alcohol as not to realize fully the importance and impact of his actions, should not be held injuriously against him after he regained sobriety and then proceeded to minimize the burden of the State in proving its case and making such test unnecessary by a plea of no contest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In consolidated actions, plaintiffs, a city that owned the airport, airlines, and non-airline tenants, challenge the decision of defendants, a city manager, a city council clerk, the members of the city council, a director of finance, an agent for annexation, and a city, to annex the airport. Ten defendants sought to quash service of summons; other defendants filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When defendants tried to annex the airport, plaintiffs sought a permanent injunction to stop the annexation. The court held that the summons were validly served by a de facto special deputy who had the authority to make the service by special, written deputization and that the deputy made oath to the services and the returns in full compliance with Ohio Rev. Code. Ann. &sect; 2703.07. The court held that plaintiff city had capacity to bring the action because as the owner of the airport, it was an interested party and person within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code. Ann. &sect; 709.07, 701.01, and 1.02. Defendants were persons authorized by Ohio Rev. Code. Ann. &sect; 709.07(B) to be named as defendants because of their official capacities, which related to the annexation. Finally, the court held that plaintiffs were entitled to a permanent injunction to prevent the annexation because the annexation of the airport by defendants was unreasonable, defendants' proceedings were erroneous and unlawful, and the proposed annexation would vitally and adversely affect plaintiffs' legal rights and interests. Annexation did not benefit the airport and would result in governmental and administrative conflicts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver was arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19, after he refused to submit to a chemical test to determine his concentration of alcohol. The driver pleaded guilty to the charge and the trial court suspended his driver's license for six months during a hearing held pursuant to the state's Implied Consent Statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191. The driver challenged the suspension of his driver's license on the ground that administrative suspension of his license for six months was unconstitutional, he having obviated by his conduct every purpose for which Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191 was enacted. The court ruled that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191(E), if a person whose license or permit to drive was suspended petitioned for a hearing or appealed any decision which was adverse to him, the suspension began at the termination of any hearing or appeal unless the hearing or appeal resulted in a decision favorable to the person. The court reversed the judgment, concluding that the suspension of the license served no valid purpose after the driver complied with the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner municipal residents sought a permanent injunction against respondents, a city and its officials, enjoining the city and officials thereof from implementing or enforcing Toledo, Ohio, Ordinance 719-68, the so-called Gun Control Law, declaring such ordinance unconstitutional and contrary to the city's charter, restraining the named defendants from collecting fees or registering any applicants, and for costs and attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner municipal residents filed suit against respondent municipality and municipal officials, seeking to enjoin enforcement of a gun control ordinance. The ordinance prohibited certain classes of persons (the mentally disturbed and prior felons among them) from owning firearms, required licensure of others seeking to own firearms, and barred possession of concealed firearms. Petitioners maintained that the ordinance violated their due process rights, their right to bear arms, and their self-incrimination privilege. In addition, petitioners maintained that respondents had adopted the ordinance in excess of their powers. The court rejected all of petitioner's arguments. It ruled that local governments have the power to regulate the possession of firearms just as they do the exercise of other fundamental rights, and the restrictions imposed in this instance were not unreasonable. In addition, petitioners' claimed that U.S. Const. amend. II applied was meritless, inasmuch as that statute restricted only federal action. Moreover, petitioners could not complain about being denied a firearm license until such time as they actually sought one.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was entered in favor of respondents. The gun control ordinance was not an unconstitutional restriction on the right of gun ownership, being reasonable in all respects and within respondent municipality's authority to enact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, citizens and taxpayers, attacked the constitutional validity of Ohio's &quot;Bus Law,&quot; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3327.01 and 3327.011, to the extent that it authorized and required that public funds be spent to transport pupils to and from private religious schools at public expense. Plaintiffs and defendant state officials submitted the case to the court on motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs asserted that the &quot;Bus Law&quot; violated the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 7 and art. VI, &sect; 2. Sustaining defendants' motion for summary judgment, the court concluded that the &quot;Bus Law&quot; did not violate the First Amendment because the United States Supreme Court had rejected every argument contained in plaintiffs' briefs. The court held that the &quot;Bus Law&quot; did not violate Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 7 because, assuming that a private religious school was a place of worship, the indirect benefits to the church-sponsored schools from bus transportation of its students to and from school was not support of such place of worship within the purview of art. I, &sect; 7. The court determined that the fact that a sectarian school could locate its buildings wherever it saw fit did not give it control over the state's school funds, in violation of Ohio Const. art. VI, &sect; 2. The court found that once a state chose to provide bus transportation to all children, it could not constitutionally deny it to children attending privately-owned &quot;religious schools&quot; as contrasted to those attending privately-owned &quot;non-religious schools.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court sustained the state officials' motion for summary judgment in their favor, declared that the &quot;Bus Law&quot; was constitutional, and dismissed plaintiffs' petition, at plaintiffs' costs. The court overruled plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and their prayer for a permanent injunction.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the council members' refusal to enact the ordinance was based upon the advice of the village solicitor. Thus, a written request from the electors to bring an action against the council members under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 733.59 would have been unavailing. The electors contended that the council members had a clear mandatory duty to submit the charter amendment to the electors by ordinance because there were no defects in form of the petition, signatures, or affidavits needed for the amendment to the charter. The court concluded that it was without authority to interfere with the submission of the proposed amendment to the village charter to the electors on the ground that the amendment, if adopted, would be unconstitutional because such a claim was prematurely asserted.</SPAN></P>

The State argued that the statute was mandatory and jurisdictional and that the landowners' appeal had to be denied. The court denied the State's motion to dismiss because it found that the landowners promptly did everything that they could do to obtain their day in court by turning their case over to a respected attorney. The unavoidable misfortune suffered by the landowners could not be used to deny them their right to have a jury assess the amount of just compensation due to them for this taking of their property.

Defendant also contended that &sect; 731.03, like Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.20 was not a criminal statute. On appeal, the court held that the mayor was qualified to adjudicate the matter under Ohio Rev.

The court held that the zoning regulations were confiscatory, unreasonable, unconstitutional, and void. The court reasoned that because the flights from the airport were so low and frequent that they interfered with the residents' use and enjoyment of their property that the regulations amounted to a taking of the residents' property for public use without compensation.</SPAN></P>

The distributor had attempted to secure jurisdiction over the manufacturer under the provisions of Ohio's long-arm statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2307.381 to 2307.385 inclusive. There was service of process on the manufacturer through the Secretary of State's office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The manufacturer entered into a distributorship agreement with the distributor. No conference between the parties ever took place in Ohio. The distributor executed a contract in Ohio and mailed it to the manufacturer in New York. The agreement contained a provision that the contract was executed in and was to be construed by the laws of New York. The question was whether Ohio's long-arm statute could be invoked against the manufacturer. That involved the &quot;minimum contacts&quot; theory, which permitted the forum state of Ohio to exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant. The court was of the opinion that by applying the fairness test promulgated both by International Shoe and Hanson v. Denckla, the manufacturer could not be held to be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of Ohio under Ohio's long-arm statute. No representative or agent of the manufacturer ever came into Ohio. In essence, it was a solitary business transaction. The money value of the transaction was not substantial. There was no tortious injury to anyone in Ohio. Therefore, the attempted service under the long-arm statute was ineffective.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the complaint. It noted that it was not proper for the court to interfere in the legislative function of government and that there were no allegations of bad faith, fraud, abuse of discretion, or other illegal conduct. The decision to enter into an omnibus lease was a valid exercise of legislative power and was not arbitrary or unreasonable because it was preceded by a comprehensive study that recommended consolidation in order to increase the flow of goods. The court also noted that the taxpayer had only a short term lease that could not be varied by a city employee.

She returned to work four days after the injury and received workers' compensation benefits but received no other benefits. She timely appealed the denial of her application for permanent partial disability. The court reversed and held that the eligibility provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.57(A) were unconstitutional and ordered the Commission to determine the extent of the teacher's permanent disability without regard to the unconstitutional provisions. Under the section, the teacher had to receive compensation for either temporary total disability or partial disability, or she needed to be eligible for temporary total disability to apply for permanent total disability. Here, she was ineligible for permanent partial disability because she did not miss the required week of work. The provision deprived her of the right to financially recover for her injuries. These provisions were unreasonable because they were not related to the presence or absence of permanent partial disability in a case and only encouraged a person to feign a week's total disability in order to be paid for any permanent disability that might later result.</SPAN></P>

The teachers responded by striking. The trial court granted the school's district's application for a temporary restraining order, which prohibited defendants from refusing to perform their contracts with the board of education. Defendants argued that that temporary restraining order violated their right to free speech and assemblage. The issue before the court was whether the teachers had a right to strike. The court overruled defendants' motion to dismiss the temporary restraining order, but modified the second paragraph of the order because it was overly broad. The court implicitly held that the teacher's did not have a right to strike because they were servants of the government. The court found that the teachers were plainly on strike and had absented themselves by concerted action from their positions. The court also found that the officers of the education association were present at the teachers' meetings and therefore participated in the strike.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver claimed that a particular city was besieged by mobs and rioters seeking to bring about social reforms by violence. He alleged that he was assaulted, battered, and lynched by a mob while driving his taxicab, causing him to sustain certain injuries. The driver sought recovery under &sect; 3761.03, which provided that a person assaulted and lynched by a mob could recover from a county in which such assault was made. The court sustained the county's demurrer to the petition, holding that although the allegations in the petition met the requirements that the driver allege an &quot;assault,&quot; the county owed no extraordinary duty to protect the driver from the mob and rioters under the circumstances. In the petition, the driver used the words &quot;riot&quot; and &quot;rioters.&quot; Those words meant that a number of persons unlawfully assembled and did not have any purpose. To recover under such a statute, a purpose like exercising correctional power or seeking to bring about social reform was required to be shown. Although the court suggested that the statute be amended or repealed, it declined to decide the issue on constitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city contended that the airport expansion violated its zoning ordinance, that it constituted a nuisance, and that it would irreparably injure the city's citizens. Defendants countered that state law pre-empted the field on the promotion of airport facilities and that the regional airport authority had the power of eminent domain. The court denied the injunction. The court found that the city's ordinance prohibited a commercial aviation field, which was classified as a nuisance. However, the court also found that Ohio Rev. Code ch. 38 provided for the creation of a regional airport authority. Because state law was paramount if there was a conflict with a local ordinance, the court held that the city's ordinance did not prevent the use of land to expand the airport. The court further held that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 713.02 did not require city planning commission approval for the airport expansion. In addition, the court held that an airport was not a nuisance per se and that the city failed to show that its citizens would be deprived of the peaceful use of their premises or would suffer irreparable injury from the airport expansion.</SPAN></P>

As the declaration that the lodge requested was not required, even under strict common law rules, it was not entitled to a more definite statement.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state highway director intended to construct a limited access freeway. The proposed alignment bisected the association's cemetery and rendered approximately one third of it useless. The association sought relief and the court enjoined the city and director from constructing the highway across the association's property. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1721.01 provided that cemetery associations could appropriate up to 640 acres of land that would be, in part, exempt from taxation, with the exception that appropriation was permitted for widening or relocating then existing public highways if the lands to be appropriated were within but contiguous to its boundary and not containing graves that were in use as such. The court held that the proposed alignment did not fall within the exception stated in &sect; 1721.01 because bisecting the cemetery lands could not be considered as contiguous and therefore the city and the director had no right to appropriation. The court further held that &sect; 1721.01 was constitutional as applied to both the director and the city because it did not violate the right of eminent domain under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 19 or Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

Upon her death, the trial court determined that the trust property was subject to an inheritance tax pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5731.02(D) against the persons who succeeded to that property based on its value at the time of decedent's death. The successors and the Department filed exceptions to the ruling. The trial court overruled the exceptions, concluding that &sect; 5731.02(D) was constitutional. The trial court stated that the failure of the decedent, as donee of the power to appoint, to exercise the power was just as effective to vest ownership of the property in the successors as the exercise of the power. The control of the succession of the trust property was in the decedent, as donee, and she selected the successors by her failure to act. The power to appoint distributees of property resulted in a vesting of valuable property rights and was within the power of the states to tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff railroads brought an action for a declaratory judgment against defendant public officers to declare that the interpretation of the word &quot;firemen&quot; in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4999.07 and 4999.08 did not require a &quot;fireman&quot; on a Diesel-electric locomotive; or, if the trial court should interpret said statutes to require a &quot;fireman,&quot; to declare that the statutes were unconstitutional. Intervenor unions contested the railroads' position.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The railroads did not want to have to put a fireman on their diesel-electric locomotives. At the time of passage of the statutes at issue, diesel-electric locomotives did not exist. The railroads argued that the word &quot;fireman,&quot; as used in &sect;&sect; 4999.07 and 4999.08, was a plain and unambiguous word, which had to be construed according to its ordinary and common usage at the time of the passage of the statutes. The court agreed with how the term &quot;fireman&quot; should be interpreted but not with the railroads' application of the rule of construction. The court found that the General Assembly would not have completely disregarded the actual responsibilities of a fireman and merely pick up a dictionary without regard to railroad operations and the functions served by employees of railroads when writing a statute. Thus, the term fireman meant more than a man who tended or fed fires. In addition, the statutes required a fireman not only on a steam engine or locomotive but also on a diesel-electric locomotive. The dangers sought to be avoided when the statutes were enacted, were not lessened to such an extent that the minimum crew requirements were now clearly unreasonable and arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

The city's housing inspector cited the husband and wife for violating East Cleveland, Ohio, Housing Code &sect; 5-2 (D), which prohibited the overcrowding of dwelling houses in the community.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city sought to demolish two old boarded-up frame dwellings, and plaintiff owners of the dwellings brought a petition to prohibit defendant from demolishing the dwellings. Plaintiffs claimed that defendant was not proceeding with urban renewal but was seeking fraudulently and by an abuse of its police power to get these and many other vacant properties in the general area without compensating for them in violation of due process. The plaintiffs further claimed that the ordinances under which defendant had taken action were unconstitutional. The court dismissed plaintiffs' petition, holding that the structures in question were in fact and in the sight of the law public nuisances. The court held that the demolition of plaintiffs' premises set forth in the ordinances should have proceeded without delay to the end that the nuisances were abated. The court found that plaintiffs had paid no attention to defendant's lawful demands that they fix up their premises, but had allowed them to deteriorate and to become a menace in many neighborhoods. The court held that an owner could not have escaped responsibility or eliminated the violations by boarding up a condemned building.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with drag racing under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.251. The matter was tried. At the close of evidence defendant moved for dismissal on the following grounds: (1) that &sect; 4511.251 was unconstitutional in that it involved a presumption upon a presumption; (2) that the prima facie case of the State was rebutted by defendant's direct testimony. Memoranda were filed, and the court entered the following opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The arresting officer saw defendant's car and another car side by side. They started at the same time and accelerated quickly. He determined defendant's speed to be 30 miles over the posted speed limit. The court rejected defendant's claim that &sect; 4511.251 was unconstitutional. The only presumption involved in &sect; 4511.251 was that if two cars were operated side by side at a speed in excess of a predetermined speed--such predetermined speed depending upon the characteristics of the street, road, or highway, and being easily ascertainable and provable--the vehicles were presumed to be drag racing. Under &sect; 4511.251 the speed limits established by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.21 became absolute speed limits at which two vehicles could be operated side by side without raising a presumption of drag racing. Both factors, the speed and the side by side operation, were easily capable of proof. The statute clearly did not involve a presumption upon a presumption. Finally, the court rejected defendant's claim that he had rebutted the presumption of &sect; 4511.251 merely by stating that he did not know the other driver, had not agreed to race with him, and, in fact, was not drag racing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ruled that the statute was not unconstitutional and that defendant's rebuttal was insufficient to overcome the proof adduced by the State. Defendant's motion to dismiss was denied.</SPAN></P>

All adult beneficiaries and potential remaindermen joined in the petition, but defendant minor remaindermen in esse, who were represented by a guardian ad litem, opposed the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trustee brought a petition for permission to sell a property that was part of the trust assets, although the testator's will indicated that she did not intend that the property in question should be sold. The court granted the permission to sell the property and found that the disentailing provisions of &sect; 5303.21 authorized the court to ignore positive language in the will that inhibited the property's sale. Because &sect; 5303.21 expressly excepted only estates in dower from its disentailing language, the court held that the legislature did not intend to prohibit the proposed sale. All that the court had to find before it could order the sale was that the sale would be for the benefit of the person holding the first and existing estate, interest, or use, and would do no substantial injury to the heirs in tail, or others in expectancy, succession, reversion, or remainder. The fact that the law did not favor restraints on alienation supported the court's decision. Finally, the court concluded that the testator had made her will in reference to the disentailment statutes because she executed her will more than 100 years after the first disentailment statute was enacted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient was admitted to the hospital, and surgical procedures were performed on her a few days later.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2307.381, .385 (1965). One nonresident physician sought to quash the service of summons on the grounds that it was improperly served and the long-arm statute violated U.S Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16, art. II, &sect; 28. Both nonresident physicians contended that the long-arm statute was inapplicable because the cause of action accrued prior the effective date of Ohio Rev.

The court held that the summons was improperly served against one nonresident physician because it had not been properly served upon the Ohio Secretary of State as required under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2307.381, .385 (1965). The long-arm statute was not unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation possessed a D-2 liquor license from the state. When it constructed a new bowling alley, in an area of the city zoned as fifth area light industrial, it applied for a permit to transfer its license to the new location. The state liquor department approved the transfer. The city filed charges against the corporation for the unlawful sale of liquor at its new location, because the zoned area was &quot;dry.&quot; The court sustained the corporation's demurrer to the charges. The court found that the state of Ohio had pre-empted the field and it determined that under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3, no political subdivision could promulgate any law that was in conflict with the statutes in the pre-empted field. The court decided that the city ordinance impermissibly prohibited that which the state license permitted. The court concluded that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was too vague and indefinite and did not comply with the requirements of criminal law and ordinances. The court discharged the corporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father brought suit against the Board alleging that the Board's practices violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments because the Board: (1) adopted a system of pupil placement that resulted in segregation of pupils based upon their religious creed; (2) was using public funds to operate within the public school system parochial schools wherein a sectarian religion was taught; and (3) allowed a religious sect to obtain control of a part of the school funds of the state of Ohio. The court granted declaratory and injunctive relief to the father. The court found that the father had the requisite standing to bring the suit. The Board, by its system of operation of its schools, violated the First Amendment because it segregated schools according to religious creed. The Board's &quot;released time&quot; program violated the First Amendment because the children were not removed from the public school setting for their religious education. The religious education was held on-site by the same teachers who taught the other subjects. The teachers continued to be under the control of the Board while teaching religious studies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff drug store brought a declaratory judgment action against defendant pharmaceutical company. The United States Supreme Court ultimately affirmed a judgment declaring the Ohio Fair Trade Act (Act), Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1333.27 to 1333.34, to be constitutional. The pharmaceutical company's cross-petition for affirmative relief under the Act was then tried to the court. After a judgment for the company, the store was granted a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act permitted manufacturers and retailers to enter &quot;minimum resale price&quot; agreements. The pharmaceutical company convinced numerous retailers to sign such agreements. However, because the Act lacked a public enforcement mechanism, virtually all of the signing retailers ignored the agreements. The drug store, which never signed an agreement with the company, sought a judgment declaring the Act unconstitutional. Eventually, the Act was declared constitutional and the company was allowed to proceed on its cross-petition for affirmative relief. Inter alia, the company sought to enjoin the store from selling the company's products below the &quot;minimum resale price&quot; stated in the agreements with other retailers. The court denied relief because, before bringing suit under the Act, one who was suffering or anticipating damage by reason of a violation was required to pursue a vigorous, aggressive, and unrelenting effort to discover those selling below fixed prices and to get them to abide by the law. Because the company failed to use reasonable diligence to enforce compliance by signers of the fair-trade contracts, it was not entitled to an injunction against a non-signer like the store.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayer filed an action against defendants, the village and the cable company, seeking to enjoin them from erecting poles and structures for cable transmission, to have the ordinance which allowed the cable company to conduct such activities in the village declared null and void, and an order to remove all poles and structures in or over the public property in the village. The cable company demurred to the taxpayer's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In its demurrer, the cable company argued that (1) the parties plaintiff were defective; (2) the parties defendant were improperly joined; (3) the causes of action were improperly joined; (4) the separate causes of action against it and the village were improperly joined; and (5) the petition did not state facts which showed a cause of action. Upon review, the court found the taxpayer's petition without merit. The village had the power and authority to enact the ordinance at issue. The enactment did not constitute an abuse of the public trust upon which municipal streets were held, or, in other words, did not violate the uses and purposes for which municipal streets and highways were intended upon dedication.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that the evidence against him had been obtained in violation of both the state and federal constitutions. There was a full-scale oral argument concerning the admitted omission from the current city telephone directory of the &quot;notice&quot; referred to in the third paragraph of &sect; 4931.31 explaining the offenses provided for in that section. The State contended that publication of the &quot;notice&quot; was not necessary to the prosecution of defendant. The court found that the paragraphs of the statute should be construed together because they were included in the same legislative section and related to the same subject matter. The court determined that the third paragraph lost its independence and exclusiveness by its reference to &quot;offenses provided for in this section.&quot; The court also determined that the words &quot;directory notice&quot; were as much a part of the statute's title as the other words &quot;threat or harassment in telephone communication prohibited.&quot; The court dismissed the charge against defendant because it found that the legislature intended that the &quot;notice&quot; was indispensable to a conviction.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1333.27-34, for selling the manufacturer's products below minimum retail prices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The retailer operated discount department stores. The retailer admitted that it offered the products at prices below the minimum prices that were designated by the manufacturer. The court conditionally granted the manufacturer's request for injunctive relief. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1333.29 provided that minimum resale prices may be differentiated as to various levels of distribution, if the differentiations were not otherwise unlawfully discriminatory. There was no evidence that the manufacturer's prices were discriminatory because it was not setting different minimum resale prices for different retailers. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 1333.32(B) it was an act of unfair competition for the retailer, with notice of fair traded prices, to sell below those prices. Noncompliance with the stipulated minimum retail resale prices irreparably injured the manufacturer's minimum resale price maintenance program. The retailer did prove its affirmative defense that the manufacturer failed to diligently enforce the agreements against another retailer; therefore, the injunction was contingent upon the manufacturer's prosecution of Act violations against the other retailers.</SPAN></P>

The City filed in each case a motion for separate findings of fact and conclusions of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners owned properties on the street affected and had previously improved their properties according to the established grade of the street before the construction of the overpass. After being notified of the proposed improvement, the landowners filed their claims for damage from such, which claims were disallowed after completion of the improvement. The City filed an application to assess compensation due certain landowners abutting the improvement, but did not name the landowners at issue, and they filed actions for writs of mandamus. The court allowed the writs to issue and entered judgment in favor of the landowners, holding that the landowners were entitled to a judicial inquiry before a jury as to whether the elimination of access to their properties resulted in compensable damages. The court found that because the landowners' properties abutted the improvement, which properties were acquired by the City according to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4957, 727, the landowners were entitled to a determination of their claims for damage from the improvement. The court concluded therefore, that the actions in mandamus were the appropriate remedy for the landowners' relief.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the presumptive portions of &sect; 4511.251 could not be upheld because it shifted the burden of going forward with the evidence from the prosecution to defendant after proof of a prima facie case, watered down the presumption of innocence, set forth an unreasonable and arbitrary stand of conduct, and violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16.

Uncontradicted testimony established that defendants were deemed to be suspicious persons within the meaning of the South Euclid, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 573.01(c), (e), and (g). Section 573.01(c) provided in part that a suspicious person was any person who had tools for picking locks or pockets in their possession. Evidence was introduced that a lock pick, screw drivers, and channel locks were found in defendants' car. Defendants did not take the stand to explain the presence of the items. The court concluded that it would be virtually impossible for anyone, other than a burglar or locksmith, to explain the presence of the items. Section 573.01(e) deemed a suspicious person as any person who wandered the streets at late or unusual hours of the night without any visible or lawful business. Defendants were observed in a car at 2:50 a.m. cruising along a residential street. Defendants explained that they were riding around and talking.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ordinance that terminated the law director's services, Bedford, Ohio, Ordinance No. 2751-64, had a retroactive date and stated that the city was ratifying the mayor's act of terminating the law director. The court observed that the retroactive provision of the ordinance, although invalid under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, could be cured by substituting the date of enactment. The court determined, however, that the mayor's unilateral act of terminating the law director was a defect that could not be cured. Pursuant to Bedford, Ohio, City Charter art. II, &sect; 1(a), all powers of the city were vested in the city council. The mayor lacked the authority to terminate the law director, and the council could not delegate a power that was within its province alone. Consequently, the termination of the law director was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court gave judgment in favor of the law director for the amount of his lost salary until the date on which his replacement was hired.</SPAN></P>

The court found that a so-called charitable amendment, at Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2915.12, did not authorize lotteries for charitable purposes, as the city manager urged. The court clearly stated that lotteries were illegal in the state and that officers of the executive branch of local governments could not legalize them. The court considered that police officers and city employees might be compelled to avoid their sworn duty and follow the regulations of the city manager from fear of reprisal for insubordination if they did not do so. The court concluded that disregard for the law by public officials in any branch of government had to be restrained.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the part of the order that set the minimum wage was proper because the director had the authority to make such changes in the report of the board as were found appropriate to safeguard the basic minimum rates under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4111.07. The fixing of a minimum wage was not a violation of the constitutional provisions, and there was a direct relation between public health and general welfare and a wage that was progressive and unreasonable. Also, the laundries' argument that the board, in fixing the minimum wage, was confined solely to the question as to the value of the services rendered and that the cost of living had no part in the fixing of a fair wage overlooked both the purpose of the minimum wage law and the wording of the entire statute. That part of the order that contained the escalator clause was without authority and contrary to the law as enacted by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

The officials and attending physician testified that they were unable to adequately treat the child without such authority.

The court ruled that: (1) the evidence showed that at the moment of the order an emergency did exist within the purview of the statute; (2) the court had not only the right but the duty to act in the child's behalf and give the parents their day in court later; (3) the order was not void for want of proper service; (4) the parents had no right to risk the life of their child; (5) the order did not violate the parents' rights under U.S. Const. amend.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HISTORY BY THE COURT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a previous case and appeal, the Cleveland Sidewalk Ordinance was declared unconstitutional by Appeals Judges Fess (presiding), Younger, and Guernsey, sitting by assignment in Cuyahoga County. ( City of Cleveland, Appellee, v. Fulton H. Baker, Appellant, decided May 9, 1960: 83 Ohio Law Abs., 502, 167 N. E. (2d), 119.) That case involved obstruction of the sidewalk by street preachers. The verdict was followed by Municipal Judge Driscoll in Toledo in consolidated cases headed City of Toledo v. Joe Sines, decided September 30, 1960: 169 N. E. (2d), 516, 519-20, wherein a similar Municipal Sidewalk Ordinance was declared unconstitutional when applied to loiterers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cleveland Ordinance which had existed unchanged from 1912 or before read as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13.0941 (2050-5)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlawful congregation on Sidewalks; Penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It shall be unlawful for persons having no occupation or business at the places hereinafter named, to congregate upon or occupy the sidewalks, or at the corners of any street of the city, or in such manner as to occupy the sidewalks in front of any dwelling or place of business &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the city, or in such manner as to occupy the sidewalks in Monumental park or other public parks of the city, or in front of any place of worship or amusement. And it shall be and is hereby made the duty of the police force of the city to prevent such gatherings or occupation of sidewalks and street corners, and to arrest persons found violating the provisions of this section. Whoever violates any provision of this section shall, on conviction thereof, be fined in any sum not exceeding fifty dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A revised sidewalk ordinance was proposed for Cleveland by Councilman Parker June 15, 1960, approved by the Mayor on February 21, 1961, of which the preamble and material part read as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public safety by reason of the emergency which exists in the City of Cleveland in that the congregating of loitering gangs upon sidewalks and street corners and public places constitutes a menace to the safety of pedestrians and tends to create breaches of the peace requiring the immediate exercise of the police power to control said conditions; now, therefore</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Be it ordained by the Council of the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  City of Cleveland:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 1. That existing Section 13.0941 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland be and the same is hereby repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 2. That the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland be and the same are hereby supplemented by enacting new Section 13.0941 thereof, to read as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 13.0941.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlawful Congregation on Sidewalks; Penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any person who congregates with others on the sidewalk, street corner, or within the parks or public grounds, with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned by the serious annoyance to pedestrians or by threatening, insulting or abusive conduct, and who refuses to move on when ordered by a police officer, shall be guilty of disorderly conduct constituting a misdemeanor and on conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum not exceeding fifty dollars ($ 50.00).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 25, 1961 Mr. Baker and two associates were arrested under the new Ordinance for obstructing the sidewalk while street preaching at the period of the evening rush hour. Their location was on the sidewalk at the south side of Euclid Avenue just east of the Public Square. On April 24, the case was tried &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the Honorable Hugh A. Corrigan, Judge of the Cleveland Municipal Court. The Court held the new ordinance constitutional overruling defendants' demurrer, but granted their Motion for Discharge at conclusion of the State's case, with a finding that no &quot;breach of the peace had been proved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court's statement denying the demurrer and so validating the Ordinance, delivered from the bench at the opening of the case, and His Opinion Granting Discharge upon conclusion of State testimony, are reported in full below.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, a mutual savings bank, entered into an agreement with a national bank for the sale and transfer of all assets and liabilities to the national bank. Petitioner filed a petition for judicial supervision of proceedings in dissolution pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1702.50, and the court decided several issues. The court found the sale of assets was undertaken and carried out in accordance with law because both banks had authority under Ohio law and the national bank had authority under the National Banking Act, 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 21 et seq. The court also found the national bank obtained the written consent of the Comptroller of the Currency. The court further ruled that the transfer of assets was not a merger. Depositors of the petitioner were not members and so did not have voting rights. Petitioner's members met, voted, and authorized the transfer of assets. Finally, the court found the national bank's stockholders authorized the transaction. All steps required by law were taken in good faith.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff company brought an action against defendant property owner to enforce a written arbitration agreement in the county in which the property owner resided pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner contended that jurisdiction was in the county where he lived when the agreement was signed. The court found that it had jurisdiction over the persons and subject matter of the action, that the arbitration agreement was valid, did not violate public policy, and should be enforced. Construing the agreement as a whole in light of the circumstances under which it was made, the court found that all the parties intended that the company was a party to the agreement within the meaning of the word &quot;parties&quot; in the arbitration clause and could request arbitration under the agreement. The arbitration statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2711.03, and the agreement were not repugnant to Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16, which provided for access to the courts, because arbitration did not oust the jurisdiction of the courts but merely provided for an additional remedy of which the party could of his own free choice avail himself. The company did not revoke the existing arbitration agreement by filing a lawsuit, because a court should stay trial on application of one of the parties if the suit was brought upon any issue referable to arbitration under the written arbitration agreement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court enforced the arbitration clause of the parties' written agreement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff homeowners brought suit against defendant municipality in the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County (Ohio) seeking to enjoin the municipality from allowing the erection of a shopping center and for a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The homeowners complained that the municipality had violated zoning laws and had violated private restrictions on the property restricting its use to that of single family dwellings rather than the proposed shopping center. The court approved of the municipality's change in the zoning laws to accommodate the shopping center. The court reasoned that a 1925 ordinance that adopted a single family dwelling restriction in the location did not adopt by implication the private single family dwelling restriction that had been in place prior to that ordinance. The court further reasoned that it would be unthinkable to hold that any municipality would have to know and enforce all of the sundry and private restrictions pre-existing on property which became the subject of subsequent zoning ordinances. Further, the court held that the municipality did not abuse its discretion in subsequent adoption of a 1960 zoning ordinance to accommodate the shopping center. The court held that the municipality did not abuse its discretion in exercising the police power to rezone the property for accommodating a shopping center since ample evidence existed to support the need for commercial property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the change in the zoning from single-family residential to commercial by the municipality to accommodate changing economic and demographic circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff manufacturer brought action to prevent defendant retailer from selling its product for less than the manufacturer's established minimum price. Pursuant to the 1959 Fair Trade Law (Act), Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1333.27 to 1333.34, the trial court issued a temporary injunction restraining the retailer from selling the product at less than the established minimum price. The retailer's demurrer challenged the constitutionality of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The retailer did not purchase the manufacturer's product from the manufacturer. The manufacturer alleged that there was a contract, under the common law meaning of contract, and that the retailer purchased the goods with the knowledge of the manufacturer's trademark and was prohibited from selling the goods at less than the manufacturer's established minimum price. The retailer alleged that the Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1333.27 to 1333.34, was unconstitutional. The court held that there was no contract between the parties and that the Act unconstitutionally delegated legislative powers to private persons and, therefore, dismissed the manufacturer's petition. The petition did not allege facts establishing a common law contract. The retailer never signed any contract with the manufacturer and never contracted with the manufacturer to sell the goods at the manufacturer's established minimum price. The Act was a regulatory measure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the temporary restraining order issued by the trial court prohibiting the retailer from selling the manufacturer's product for less that the established minimum price. The court dismissed the manufacturer's petition and rendered judgment for the retailer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Relator brings this action under &sect; 2905.343 R.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motion for summary judgment filed by defendants was overruled after hearing and argument.

Defendants pray for dismissal of plaintiff's petition and that the temporary order heretofore granted be dissolved; that the court find the above section of the Revised Code to be unconstitutional, and for such other relief.

Code Ann. &sect; 2905.343.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state initiated action against the publishing corporations and sought an injunction to enjoin the publishing corporations from distributing a book alleged by the state to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, and indecent. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.343, the court had jurisdiction to enjoin the sale of such book that it believed was obscene. The court held that the test for obscenity under the constitution was: (1) The writing was without social value; (2) The writing was judged by its appeal to the average person; (3) The writing was judged by its dominant appeal, taken as a whole; (4) The appeal of the material was to aid prurient interest; and (5) The material was measured by contemporary community standards. The court held that the dominant theme of the book was the portrayal of sexuality in as alluring a light as possible for effective appeal to prurient interest. The court determined that the book was obscene and that it was not entitled to the constitutional freedom of expression. The court granted the injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant businesses filed a motion to dismiss the affidavits filed against them by plaintiff state. The affidavits alleged that the businesses violated the Sunday closing law set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3773.24, as amended by H.R. 1031, 128th Leg. (Ohio 1959).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state filed affidavits against the businesses for opening on Sunday in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3773.24, as amended by H.R. 1031, 128th Leg. (Ohio 1959). The businesses moved to dismiss the affidavits based on the insufficiency of the allegations and the unconstitutionality of &sect; 3773.24. The court took the motion to dismiss as a demurrer upon the constitutionality of &sect; 3773.24, and upon consideration, found &sect; 3773.24 to be unconstitutional and void. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss was sustained. The court determined that &sect; 3773.24: (1) was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable; (2) had unreasonable classifications; (3) granted special privileges to a few; (4) was vague; and (5) was contrary to the Ohio Constitution and the Bill of Rights. It was within the police power of the state to guard public morals, public safety, and public health, as well as to promote the common good, yet in devising legislation for such purposes, the provisions of such legislation had to be reasonable. Not only did the provisions of &sect; 3773.24 not preserve public morals, public health, and public safety, they were unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court sustained the motion to dismiss in the state's action against the businesses for violations of the Sunday closing law. The court declared the Sunday closing law unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Another county succeeded in its action against a state official to prevent the application of the other county's revenue owed to the state because of overpayments to the state. The attorney general then promised the board in a letter that the board was to be reimbursed for its overpayments. When an insufficient reimbursement was made, the board brought a claim against defendants to enjoin defendants from the collection of revenue owed to the state until the overpayments, as calculated by the action, were paid. The court dismissed the action. The claim was barred by the board's acceptance of the legislature's payment for the reimbursement, though it was less than the board's demand. The court had the right to take judicial notice of the general appropriations bill, which included the payment to the board. The claim was barred by sovereign immunity where the board's claim was essentially a claim against the state and there was no law to prevent defendants from the performance of their duties to collect revenue or to bring the claim against the state. Any claim created by the letter was barred by the six-year statute of limitations under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.07.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The car dealer sold a car to the purchasers, which was financed through a finance company. The car dealer and the purchasers entered into a side agreement that provided for a commission to the purchasers if they developed successful sales leads. The purchasers contended that the side agreement was an illegal lottery that tainted the entire purchase transaction. The car dealer filed a declaratory judgment action to determine the legality of the side agreement. The purchasers answered and filed a cross-action and the finance company filed an action to foreclose its chattel mortgage on the purchasers' car. The car dealer's motion for summary judgment as to the declaratory judgment aspect of the case was granted. The court noted that summary disposition was constitutional and appropriate because there were no disputed facts. It concluded that the side agreement was not an illegal lottery because judgment, design, and volition were required. Furthermore, any illegality caused by violation of a statutory sales license requirement was not sufficient to vitiate the contract and neither factor tainted the original sales contract.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 154-47, -47H, which were declared unconstitutional after the fees were paid. Defendants demurred to the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">For years, the state, through officers such as defendants, enforced &sect;&sect; 154-47, -47H (censorship statutes), which provided for a state screening of all motion picture films before distribution. A fee was collected for the review of the films, and the fees were paid into the state treasury or a special fund, as called for by the statutes. Plaintiff paid these fees for movies its distributed. However, the censorship statutes were later declared unconstitutional, and the state stopped enforcing them. Plaintiff sued to recover the fees it previously paid. The court sustained the demurrer but permitted plaintiff leave to amend its petition if it could do so to state a cause of action within the confines of the court's opinion. As state officers, defendants were not required to question the constitutionality of a statute. Thus, where plaintiff failed to allege that payment was not made into the funds as required by statute and the officers had no statutory obligation of repayment, there could be no recovery on a quasi contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that if plaintiff felt that it could amend its petition to state a cause of action, leave was granted to filed such an amended petition within rule, but that if no further pleading was entered, final judgment would be entered in favor of defendants at the costs of plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded the judicial test to be applied was whether the order of the board was unreasonable. The court stated that zoning was an exercise of the police power and could not be in conflict with the general laws. The court determined that the zoning board had the authority to grant the variance requested by the company if other conditions required by the ordinance were met.

The village council, by a resolution passed on October 13, 1958, authorized and directed the village board to proceed with payment for the extension of the water and sewer lines and enlargement of certain existing lines near a tract of land owned by the landowner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner required the water and sewer facilities along a certain avenue for subdivision and development. The landowner negotiated with the village council for the water and sewer lines and enlargement of certain existing lines. The village council directed the village board to proceed with payment therefor from existing water and sewer fund surpluses. On November 3, 1958, the village board refused on the grounds the proposed use of fund surpluses was prohibited by a 1930 ordinance and by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 729.52. On October 13, 1958, the village council passed Resolution 7-16 authorizing the avenue development. The court held that: (1) &quot;Resolution 7-16&quot; was in effect and substance an ordinance (Granville, Ohio, Ordinance 7-16 (1958)); (2) the action of the village council in enacting Granville, Ohio, Ordinance 7-16 (1958) effected a repeal of the earlier 1930 ordinance by implication; (3) neither Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 729.52 nor Granville, Ohio, Ordinance 7-16 (1958) contained any limitation on the authority of the village to expend funds from the water and sewer funds in the construction of the new water and sewer lines and enlargement of the existing lines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator city board of education filed a petition in mandamus against respondent auditor, in which respondent state board of education intervened, alleging that the auditor had refused to list real property within territory annexed to the city for taxation and to certify to the county treasurer for collection the board's levies upon that property. The court ruled on the demurrers of the auditor and the state board to the city board's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city board's petition sought an alternative writ and a final writ requiring the auditor to list recently annexed property for taxation and to certify the city board's levies. After the court granted the alternative writ, the auditor filed a demurrer on the ground that the petition did not set forth facts sufficient to state a cause of action. The court granted the state board leave to intervene. The state board filed a demurrer on the same grounds. The court overruled the demurrers of the auditor and the state board. Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26 provided that no property, taxed according to value, should be taxed in excess of one percent of its true value for all state and local purposes.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3311.06, which provided that annexed territory would be included in an annexing municipality's school district only with the approval of the state board, was in conflict with Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26 because it created, permitted, or allowed to continue in existence a mandated tax rate of more than 10 mills. The only constitutional solution was that all mandated levies be prorated downward until they totalled no more than 10 mills, even at the risk of a tax revenue loss.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff city appealed from an action of defendant state director of highways (director) that proposed to relocate a federal aid highway within the city limits without the city's consent. The director claimed the right to effectuate his proposal without the city's consent by virtue of power vested in him by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5521.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the powers given to the director by &sect; 5521.01 to make a determination of &quot;urgent need&quot; and to make a resolution declaring the necessity of the improvement involved political determinations, and therefore the city had no constitutional right to a hearing before the director. Moreover, since the proviso gave the city a right to a trial de novo in the court, with the right to appeal to the court of appeals and the state supreme court, the city could not claim that any right to a hearing which it may have had had been denied. The court rejected the city's contention that statutory scheme was unconstitutional because it delegated powers to the director without sufficient criteria upon which he was to make his decisions. As part of his daily duty, the director determined whether a highway on the state highway system was in need of improvement. The legislature gave him no more and no less guide posts to make his determination than it did by the enactment of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5501.11, and that was sufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the action of the director that proposed to relocate a federal aid highway within the city limits without the city's consent.</SPAN></P>

The race track operators further contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3769.082 contravened Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 22, by providing for withdrawals of money from the state treasury, not in pursuance of specific statutory appropriation. The race track operators sought a declaratory judgment that the part of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3769.082, 3769.08 be declared unconstitutional and void. The court determined that at best the race track operators were permittees whose licenses were revocable at any time under the provisions of the Horse Racing Act, and, consequently had neither contract nor property rights. The court held the race track operators had no standing the challenge the act at issue. The court stated that the state's power to tax was absolute, as was its discretion on how to spend the monies collected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When a permit to construct a gas station was issued, the adjacent property owner sued the oil corporation, the site owner, the building commissioner, and all members of the village zoning board of appeals (board), alleging that the permit was in violation of the zoning ordinance. Property owner asked for an injunction to prevent construction and for the trial court to declare the permit void, or order its revocation, and to direct the board to not issue any such subsequent permits without her written consent as per the ordinance. The injunction issued. The court held that the property owner had not only established irreparable injury, but she was entitled to relief where the zoning ordinance requiring her consent was constitutional Further, the board must expressly set forth the facts upon which a hardship was founded as a prerequisite to the granting of a variance permit. There was a lack of proof of facts that constituted a hardship. The board acted arbitrarily and the action taken by it was null and void; thus, the building permit issued by the board was null and void. Hence, the court made the requested injunctions permanent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the award of the preliminary injunctive relief requested by the adjacent property owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The resident kept racing pigeons. The pigeons were released twice a day, flying in circles of several miles, and did not stop or roost at any place other than their loft. The resident cleaned the loft twice a day. There were no noises or odors emanating from the loft. There was also no vermin or rodents in the loft area. A city ordinance made the keeping of pigeons illegal. The resident filed a petition for declaratory judgment, seeking to have the ordinance declared null and void. The court granted the resident's petition. The court stated that the evidence showed that the loft was sanitary and could in no way be considered a nuisance. The court determined that the prohibition in the ordinance was made without regard to the conditions and circumstances surrounding the resident's hobby. The court held that the raising of homing or racing pigeons was a wholesome, useful sport and that the ordinance, insofar as it interfered with the resident's hobby, was invalid because it was unreasonable and arbitrary and bore no real and substantial relation to the health, safety, and general welfare of the city's citizens.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, the township trustees and others, filed an action against defendant, a cement company, for a declaration that a zoning plan adopted by the trustees would be effective during the interim between the plan's adoption by the trustees and its approval by the voters, and that the quarrying of certain land by the company would be a common law nuisance in the future. The trustees had sought an injunction to enjoin such future nuisance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The township trustees adopted resolutions for a zoning plan for submission to voters for approval or rejection in an upcoming election. Prior to the election date, the township and others filed motions against a cement company, which was engaged in the quarrying of land located in an unzoned agricultural area. The trustees sought a declaration that the zoning plan would be effective during the interim between the plan's adoption by the trustees and its approval by the voters and that the quarrying would become a common law nuisance if the plan was approved and sought a temporary restraining order to enjoin such nuisance. On appeal from the trial court's denial of the motions, the court affirmed and held that: (1) the resolutions were legally incomplete and unenforceable until a favorable vote was cast and certified; (2) &quot;interim zoning&quot; did not exist either by the adoption of the resolutions with intent to proceed or by the adoption of the plan for submission to the voters; (3) hence, the trustees had no authority to enforce the zoning; and (4) a temporary restraining order would disturb the status quo because there was no evidence of a nuisance other than apprehension thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the township trustees' motion for a temporary restraining order and for declaratory relief, in the action of the township trustees and others against the cement company for a declaration that the trustees' zoning plan would be effective and enforceable prior to its approval by the voters and to enjoin a future nuisance in connection with the company's quarrying activities on the land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff company sought an order enjoining defendants, zoning inspector and township officers, from interfering with the strip-mining of the company's land, which was located in an agricultural district. Moreover, the company sought an order declaring the township's zoning ordinance, which prohibited strip-mining in agricultural districts, and the enabling act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.01 et seq., invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The township's ordinance prohibited striping mining on land in agricultural districts. Thereafter, the company, whose land was in an agricultural district, brought an action against defendants, praying for injunctive relief. In bringing the action, the company claimed the ordinance and the enabling act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.01 et seq., were invalid. In finding for the company, the court initially held the enabling act's agricultural use exemption had not denied other land users uniform protection of the law because public welfare had justified the classification and exemption. Moreover, the court rejected the contention that strip-mining regulation was a state, rather than a local, concern because the legislature had invested townships with regulatory power. After finding the ordinance had been adopted pursuant to a comprehensive plan, the court also rejected the contention that removal of coal by strip-mining had no deleterious effect upon the safety, moral, and welfare of the community and thus, was not subject to the police powers. However, the court held the ordinance was invalid because the ordinance had arbitrarily &quot;prohibited&quot; strip-mining on the company's land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court declared the township's zoning ordinance invalid after finding the zoning ordinance had arbitrarily prohibited the company's strip-mining operation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petroleum corporation, an unsuccessful bidder in the turnpike commission's contracting program for gas stations at turnpike service plazas, sought to enjoin performance under the contracts. The court previously denied the petroleum corporation's request for a temporary injunction of award of the contracts. On the turnpike commission's demurrer to the action, the court held that the turnpike commission acted within its discretion when it contracted for only one gas station for each turnpike service plaza. The applicable provision of the Turnpike Act (Act), Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5537.13, stated that a sufficient number of gas stations &quot;may be authorized to be established&quot; at the service plazas. The court rejected the petroleum corporation's assertion that the word &quot;may&quot; in &sect; 5537.13 was more properly interpreted as a mandatory &quot;shall.&quot; The turnpike commission did not abuse its discretion under the Act, which had as its overriding goal the expeditious movement of traffic within the state. The court held that the claim failed to state a cause of action, and sustained the turnpike commission's demurrer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs were adjacent property owners. Defendant obtained a building permit to erect a &quot;modernistic&quot; residence on the lot. The zoning regulations required a setback of 100 feet. All the properties in the area were set back 100 feet or more, but due to the curved shape of the road, the setbacks were not uniform. Plaintiffs alleged that they were damaged by defendant's construction of the home due to the setback violation and the style of the home. The court, balancing the equities between the parties, found that more harm would have resulted to defendant than plaintiffs, who were not damaged by the construction of the house. Thus, plaintiffs were not entitled to injunctive relief because they were not &quot;especially damaged&quot; by defendant's construction of the home as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 713.13. The court determined that none of plaintiffs lost air, view or light due to the construction of the home, which had a setback of 87 feet. The court also found that defendant established laches by plaintiffs because they knew or could have known the nature and progress of the work on the home, yet they waited to file an action until the work had progressed.</SPAN></P>

The superintendent found that there were insufficient assets to justify the appointment of an ancillary receiver to disburse the funds to claimants in Ohio proceedings, but still did not disburse the funds. The court granted the writ of mandamus, holding that, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3903.32, the superintendent had the legal right to seek to be appointed as ancillary receiver after insolvency proceedings began in New York in order to liquidate the deposit on behalf of Ohio claimants. Having exercised his discretion not to do so because of the insufficiency of the fund, he had the legal duty under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3903.32 to transfer the funds to the domiciliary receiver within a reasonable time. The court held that the superintendent had not exercised its discretion and performed its duty in a reasonable time.

The court concluded based on a preponderance of evidence that &sect; 3 of Ordinance 241 contained reasonable specifications and was valid. Likewise, &sect; 1 of Ordinance 241 respecting public roads and streets was valid. The court determined that &sect; 2 of Ordinance 241 was separable, and the portion of &sect; 2 that prohibited the laying out and the use of a private road as access to more than one dwelling house not in compliance with &sect; 3 of Ordinance 241 was valid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statute prohibited the sale of loaves of bread weighing less than 16 ounces. The director stated that the rolls fell within the prohibition. Claiming that its rolls came within an exemption, the baker filed an action to enjoin the director from interfering with the sale of the rolls. The court denied the injunction. The director adopted a rule that three ounces was the maximum weight of a roll. Revising the definition of a roll was within the director's discretion. The court had to preserve the law by refusing to permit a capricious and unreasonable use of an exception to destroy the public protection provided. A broad restraint upon the powers of the executive department was not justified in light of the separation of powers. There was no showing of an abuse of discretion by the director in failing to prescribe rules and regulations. The term &quot;rolls&quot; was sufficiently identified in the baking industry. Laws fixing the standard size of loaves of bread and prohibiting the sale of other sizes prevented frauds and required honest weights. They were lawful exertions of the state's police power. There was no specific or express prohibition of such state action.</SPAN></P>

The lease was for 99 years and was renewable forever. According to the terms of the lease, the contractor was to erect a building in which the town hall was to be located. The contractor, who had submitting the winning bid at public auction, performed under the lease. After filing for bankruptcy protection, the bankruptcy trustees conveyed the contractor's leasehold interest to the bank in 1910. The township trustees argued that the lease with the contractor was null and void and that the conveyance to the bank was null and void. The court dismissed the action. The court held that the township trustees were estopped from denying the leasehold interest because the lease stated that the lease actually began on April 27, 1872 and that the contractor had performed under the lease. The court also held that the lease, accompanying documents, and the copies of newspaper articles and advertisements from 1872 were admissible as ancient documents. Further, the township trustees were not entitled to accept the benefits of the lease for years and then deny the lease.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complainant brought the action on behalf of himself and others against the board to determine the validity of the revised sanitary code. The trial court rendered an order in favor of defendants. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's order, concluding that the rules and regulations of the board were reasonable, constitutional, and necessary for the preservation of the health of the community, that the fees charged were not excessive to the extent that they could have been considered taxes, and that an emergency existed. The court determined that while Ohio Gen. Code &sect;&sect; 3516, 3637 did not expressly give to the board the right to license master plumbers and register journeymen for a fee, by reason of the powers given the board by statute, there was an implied authority to so license and register. The court found that there was a proper standard for qualifications for licensing and registering and for governing health regulations in the county, and that whatever authority was granted to the board was not a delegation of a legislative right. The court would not inquire into the board's reasons for declaring an emergency, and thereby substitute its reasoning for the board's.</SPAN></P>

XV, &sect; 6. The court sustained the demurrers to plaintiffs' amended petition, holding that there was nothing to justify the belief that the fact that the bingo was for charitable purposes, that made the bingo legal. In support, the court held that it would not undertake to shackle law enforcement officials in their efforts to enforce the laws of the state, nor would it assume that law enforcement officials would make arrests without reasonable grounds to believe that those arrested were engaged in activities violative of the penal laws. The court found that the action involved nothing in fact beyond the fear of plaintiffs that they would be arrested and successfully prosecuted if they resumed their bingo operations.

However, the chairwoman's petition did not aver that the city threatened arrest under the provisions of &sect; 13064. The court found that Ohio Const. art. XIV, &sect; 6 declared all lotteries to be illegal and against public policy, that a bingo game was a lottery violative of the state constitution, and that Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 13064 did not authorize or give validity to any gambling transaction. The court sustained the city's motion for judgment on the pleadings and held that no justiciable controversy existed because the chairwoman did not have a legally protectible interest in the alleged controversy. The court found that an interpretation of &sect; 13064 would not have ended the uncertainty or the controversy alleged in the petition because the chairwoman did not plead that the statute was unconstitutional or that there had been unlawful threats to interfere with any recognizable property right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a class action, plaintiffs, insurer, motor vehicle dealers, and insurance agent, sought to enjoin defendants, superintendent of insurance and director of commerce, from revoking or from refusing to grant insurance agents licenses upon certain ground. Defendants demurred on the basis that plaintiffs did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dealers offered automobile insurance to the purchasers of their vehicles. Defendants denied or revoked dealers' licenses pursuant to Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 644 and Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 644-3, which barred licenses where their principal use was to sell insurance under such circumstances. The court rejected defendants' contention that the statutes referred only to the time that the dealers held the vehicles and that as soon as the property was sold, the restriction no longer applied. Rather, the restrictions applied to the time the sale was consummated. The court also rejected defendants' constitutional objections because the right to engage in the insurance business was not an absolute right but a privilege granted by the state upon specified terms. The subject restrictions were neither a deprivation of property nor a grant of special privileges, but only sought to prevent an unfair advantage in the placing of insurance. They did not deprive anyone from the right to secure a license to sell insurance, and the fact that an insurance lobby may have secured the passage of the law was immaterial. Finally, the court held that mere solicitation for insurance did not violate the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the petition, which sought to enjoin defendants from revoking or refusing to grant insurance agents licenses, did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee State Medical Board of Ohio revoked appellant doctor's license to practice mechanotherarpy. The doctor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board charged the doctor with using thiamine chloride, liver extract, sulphathiazole ointment, nupercainal, quinocaine, metycaine, and otozole in violation of the Board's rules and regulations governing limited practices. The doctor argued that the Board's charge was too indefinite, but the charges of boards were not required to be in the same form of exactness as charges made in law or equity. The doctor then challenged the legislature's power to pass binding regulations concerning the practice of medicine and the constitutionality of such powers. The court determined that the legislature, by its exercise of police power, had the right to adopt precautionary measures governing the practice of medicine. The doctor was prohibited from administering the above-mentioned drugs by statute. Such a statute was a valid exercise of the state's police power and was sufficiently definite to be enforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The school board passed a regulation that required its teachers and employees to sign a loyalty oath and to swear that they were not, never had been, and would never be, members of the Communist Party, fascists, or Nazis. The taxpayer argued that such a regulation was contrary to both the state and federal constitutions, and the taxpayer filed an action for injunctive relief. The court, in a blistering condemnation of the taxpayer, held that the school board had broad discretionary power as to what regulations were necessary to protect the children of the district and that if the school board decided a loyalty oath was necessary to protect its school children from the undeniable threat of communism, the court did not find its decision an abuse of discretion or contrary to constitutional protections. The court held that asking an individual if he was communist was relevant as to a determination of his credibility and nothing in the regulation, which had no provisions for its enforcement, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the taxpayer's action for injunctive relief against the school board because the board, in requiring its employees and teachers to sign a loyalty oath, was acting within its discretionary authority and was not violating either the state or federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the taxpayer's action at his cost. The court held that &sect; 1345-6(d)(2a) was not a bill of attainder because it was framed to deprive citizens of a privilege only if they were presently, not previously, engaged in disloyal activities. The court held that the statute did not prevent the taxpayer from exercising his right to speak and provided only the reasonable condition precedent to participation in the unemployment compensation fund that the claimant disavow membership in a party advocating violent overthrow. The court found no evidence that enforcement of the statute would have led to any great confusion, contention, or litigation or undermined the purpose of the unemployment compensation laws.</SPAN></P>

The court sustained the city's demurrer after rejecting the taxpayer's contentions. The court found that Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect;&sect; 8 and 9, which gave the state the power to impose an income tax, did not prohibit a city from also imposing an income tax, as long as the combined taxes did not exceed the constitutional rate. Because the city had the power to levy the income tax, the taxpayer was not deprived of his money without due process of law. The court rejected the taxpayer's contention that the tax unlawfully impaired a contract because no contract was pleaded in the complaint and because the tax did not in any way change the taxpayer's contract with his employer. The court held that, under existing precedent, the state was entitled to tax the taxpayer's earnings before income taxes were withheld. The court rejected the taxpayer's clams concerning discrimination because the classification of incomes for taxation was a matter to be determined by the legislative branch. As long as members of a given class were similarly affected, different classifications of taxpayers were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state of Ohio brought an action against a telephone company to enjoin it from abandoning several of its telegraph offices and substituting them with local telephone companies. The company filed an answer followed by a demurrer from the state that the answer was insufficient to constitute a defense. The demurrer was overruled and an appeal ensued. The state alleged that the company was a common carrier within the state and as such, was subject to the regulations of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). The company argued that PUCO had no power or authority to regulate the discontinuance, reduction, impairment or abandonment of services furnished by the company and that insofar as PUCO required an application and approval prior to such abandonment and service change, it was in conflict with the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The court determined that the changes to be made did not constitute an abandonment or termination of service but merely a change in the way the service was rendered. As such, there was no duty on the company to make application with PUCO for such a change or to seek its approval. The decision overruling the demurrer was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the guardian of an incompetent was appointed to represent the estate of an incompetent individual, he filed an application for the fixing and allowance of a reasonable sum to be paid a corporate surety as bond premium for becoming his surety in accordance with Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 9572. The court held that the surety company was entitled to be paid a portion of the estate for becoming the surety of the incompetent. The court determined, however that in order for the amount to be paid to be reasonable under &sect; 9572, it had to be no more than a fourth of one percent per annum of the amount of such bond. The court granted the guardian's application to pay only that percentage to the surety company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ordered that the guardian of an incompetent pay a reasonable sum to a surety company for becoming the incompetent's surety.</SPAN></P>
