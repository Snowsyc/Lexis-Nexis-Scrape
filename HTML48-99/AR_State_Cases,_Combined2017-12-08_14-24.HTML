</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the offenses should have been severed. The court stated that if the evidence supported a determination that both homicides occurred as a part of the same criminal episode, or were parts of a series of connected acts, then it was not incumbent on the trial court to grant a severance, and certainly not mandatory. The court found the trial court had that discretion and its discretion was not abused. Defendants next urged that the trial judge erred in excusing certain jurors for cause. The conscientious or religious scruples against the death penalty were not disqualifying. The jurors had to indicate that they would automatically vote against the death penalty. Defendants also argued that the jury ignored mitigating evidence presented during the penalty phase, so the death penalty was the result of passion or prejudice. The court found that based on the evidence, the jury had properly considered the mitigating evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant, a foreign corporation whose officers and directors did not reside in the state, sought a permit to sell cigarettes through vending machines. The Commissioner of Revenues denied the permit based upon a residency requirement in Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 84-4505 (f)(1), (2) (Repl. 1980). On appeal, the court noted that the sale of cigarettes was not regulated within the state in any way that was remotely connected with the public health, safety, or welfare. The court determined that the purpose of the act in question was to provide a system for the collection of taxes. The court reversed the Commissioner's denial of the permit. The court held that the statute was not reasonably related to any interest sought to be protected by the state and therefore was unconstitutional as applied to nonresidents as an unlawful discrimination against interstate concerns.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant putative father challenged the judgment of the Washington Circuit Court, Second Division (Arkansas), which dismissed the father's petition against appellee mother seeking a legal declaration that he was the father of the illegitimate child and asking for reasonable visitation privileges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the Arkansas statutes granting mothers the right to file a petition against a man to have him declared the father but not granting the father the right to file a suit establishing his own paternity violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The issue was whether the father had the right to a hearing in county court on his petition to have reasonable visitation with the child. The court reversed and remanded the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the father had the right to such a hearing. The court concluded that fathers of illegitimate children had basic rights when the welfare of their children was concerned. The court explained that those rights were not absolutely definable nor could they be. The court noted that the father sought to accept some responsibility for the child and was able to show that a relationship of some kind existed between himself and the child. The court determined that Ark. Const. art. 7, &sect; 28 explicitly placed jurisdiction in the county court in all matters relating to bastardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court with directions to reinstate the petition of the father and grant him a hearing in the county court regarding his petition for paternity and visitation.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the quantum of proof applied by the trial court was correct because the case fell in an interim period between prior caselaw that rendered unconstitutional a statutory provision disallowing illegitimate children to inherit from their father and the effective date of the amended statute; (2) appellee provided competent testimony that the decedent dated her mother, that the decedent's name was on her birth certificate, that her school records and marriage license reflected the decedent's surname, and that the decedent recognized her as his daughter; (3) pursuant to Ark. R. Evid. 803(19), Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28-1001 (1979), the trial court did not err in allowing testimony as to general reputation in the community on the issue of paternity; and (4) the trial court did not err in overruling the heirs' objection to the admissibility of appellee's birth certificate because such was properly admitted under Ark.

He also contended that a remark made by the trial judge in the presence of the jury constituted a comment on the evidence requiring reversal. The court affirmed the conviction because there was substantial evidence that defendant, while armed with a rifle, threatened to shoot both prosecuting witnesses, and intended to cause, and did cause, both of them to fear for their lives. The comment by the judge was not reversible error because it did not amount to a comment on the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the jury was free to convict on capital felony murder or on a lesser included offense, and could choose between death and life without parole. The court further noted that it was impossible to avoid the use of general language, and that the statutes' wording could have been deliberate to lighten the possible punishment that might have been imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, children of the testator, sought grant of their petition for rehearing on the court's previous affirmance of the decision by the Pope Probate Court (Arkansas), which allowed appellee widow of the testator to take against the will of the testator. The children alleged that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 60-501, 60-507, 61-202, 61-233, 62-701, 62-727, 62-25-1 to 2502, and Ark.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A specific bequest to the widow in the testator's will lapsed when he and the widow sold the property. The residual of the will was bequeathed to his children. After the will was admitted into probate and pursuant to Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect;60-501 (1971), the widow filed her elective share to take against the will and also filed a petition for assignment of a dower interest in property sold by the executor of the will. The children alleged that the widow's interests should be disallowed because the elective share and dower laws violated the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteen Amendment and were arbitrary and discriminatory as gender based and failing to give equal rights to a widower/husband. The trial court granted the widow's claim and in a previous decision the court affirmed that decision. The court now granted the children's petition for rehearing and reversed and remanded the trial court's ruling. The court held that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 60-501, 60-507, 61-202, 61-233, 62-701, 62-727, 62-25-1 to 2502 all violated the Equal Protection clause by favoring widows and wives over widowers and husbands as gender based legislation that did not serve a legitimate governmental purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagor purchased a residential lot from the mortgagee and executed a note for the balance with an interest of 12 percent per annum. To secure the payment of this note, the mortgagor executed a first mortgage to the mortgagee on the lot. The mortgagor brought suit to have the note and mortgage declared usurious and void, in violation of Ark. Const. art. 19, &sect; 13 (1874), which restricted the charge of interest to 10 percent annually. The mortgagee argued that the loan was valid because it came within the preemptive provisions of the Act. The chancery court granted in favor of the mortgagee, holding that the note and mortgage was valid under the Act. The court then reversed the decision of the chancery court, holding that &sect; 501 (a)(1) of the Act was an invalid legislative exercise of congressional power pursuant to the commerce clause. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. Stating that the mortgagee sufficiently met the requirements of the Act, the court stated that the Act was a valid exercise of congressional authority pursuant to the commerce clause and that the loan in question was not usurious.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that a Rule 37 petition provided a basis for relief when a sentence violated the constitution or was otherwise subject to collateral attack. Some of petitioner's issues should have been raised at trial or on his direct appeal. Petitioner failed to show that a court security guard, who acted as a witness at his trial, had an improper relationship with the jury. Due to the lack of an objection by petitioner's trial counsel, the trial judge had not abused his discretion by excusing four potential jurors because they were students. The trial court had no duty to give an instruction on the lesser offense of first degree murder where trial counsel did not request it. The constitutionality of 1973 Ark. Acts 438, which re-imposed the death penalty, had been previously upheld. The State had carried its burden of proof during the sentencing phase of the trial. Petitioner received effective assistance of trial counsel.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 41-1502(1)(a) were constitutional as applied to defendant; 2) the statutes did not make avoidance of the death penalty dependent on the jury's disregard of the law and in the event the jury found defendant guilty of capital murder, the jury was vested with the power to sentence defendant to either the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole; 3) the application of the capital murder statute did not preclude consideration of the lesser offense of murder in the first degree because it would have been reversible error to have failed to instruct the jury as to murder in the first degree since defendant was charged with capital murder; and 4) life without parole was not cruel and unusual punishment for capital murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's petition for post-conviction relief argued that the confession prompting his plea was coerced and that the attorney who advised him to plead guilty was ineffective. The circuit court denied relief. On appeal, the court explained that a guilty plea broke the chain of events preceding it in the criminal process. Alleged constitutional deprivations leading up to the plea would not be addressed in a hearing for post-conviction relief. Instead, the court would only consider whether defense counsel was so incompetent that the plea could not have been voluntarily and intelligently made. To evaluate defense counsel's effectiveness, the court refused to second guess his trial tactics. The issue was not whether counsel's decisions had been correct, but whether the presumption that counsel was competent had been overcome. Defendant did not submit such proof. Conflicting evidence about counsel's performance was for the circuit court to decide, and the evidence did not preponderate against it. The length of time between the confession and the plea had dissipated any taint the confession might have had. Nor was it improper to allow fear of the death penalty to influence defendant.</SPAN></P>

After the death of the husband, his widow sought to take against the will and the executor, the testator's son, conveyed property belonging to the estate to a third party and challenged the widow's right to take against the will. The lower court entered judgment in favor of the widow and the court affirmed. The court found that the executor only had standing to challenge Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 62-2501 (Repl. 1971), which provided for widow's allowances because the other statutes relating to dower provided equally for widows and widowers. The court concluded that statutes that provided for widows' allowances withstood equal protection scrutiny because they bore a fair and substantial relation to the legislature's desire to reduce the disparity between the economic capabilities of a man and a woman in the society as it then existed.</SPAN></P>

The appeal was taken under Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-311(E) (1977) by citizens who opposed the Board's decision granting a license to the applicant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant asserted that an appeal de novo from the Board constituted an unconstitutional exercise of executive powers by the judiciary. After the circuit court denied the applicant's motion to dismiss the citizens' appeal, the applicant sought to bar the circuit court from proceeding with a trial de novo. The court held that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-311(E) (1977) was unconstitutional to the extent that it authorized the circuit court to redetermine or disregard the factual grounds upon which the Board relied to issue the liquor license. The court reasoned that the Board's discretion to issue licenses under Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-301 (1977) was a constitutionally-preserved matter of executive discretion that could not be frustrated by trials de novo in the circuit courts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a codefendant shot a storeowner to death in the course of a robbery. Defendant testified in his defense that although he knowingly went to the store for the purpose of robbing the victim he did not take part in the actual murder of the victim. There was evidence that defendant was suffering from mental disease or defect or drug intoxication at the time of the offense. He requested the trial court to give instructions on the lesser included offenses of first degree murder, second degree murder, manslaughter and negligent homicide. The trial court refused to give these instructions. Defendant's convictions were reversed. The court held that the trial court's ruling that there was no evidence to indicate a lesser degree of murder was prejudicial error because the evidence as presented would at least support giving the instruction on murder in the first degree. The court stated that had the jury been given an opportunity to decide between murder in the first degree and capital felony murder they may have chosen the former. Under the instructions given, they were not permitted to find defendant guilty of murder in the first degree.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed, asserting evidentiary, instructional, and procedural error. Defendants prevailed. The selection of defendants' jury violated defendants constitutional rights under the Equal Protection Clause because: (1) defendants showed a prima facie case of discriminatory jury selection; and (2) the prosecution did not rebut it. Specifically, defendants demonstrated: (1) a substantial disparity or underrepresentation of blacks in the jury; and (2) either positive indicia of discrimination or proof that the selection procedure provided an opportunity for discrimination. The prosecution did not show that constitutionally permissible procedures were followed in the selection of the names to be placed in the jury wheel. Neither the presumption that the commissioners properly discharged their duties nor their denials of discrimination served to rebut defendants' prima facie case. Defendants failed to preserve their allegations of instructional error. Sufficient evidence predicated defendants' convictions.

The power company then brought the condemnation lawsuit 18 months later to acquire a right of way across the ranch. The ranch answered that the power company had allegedly made no effort to negotiate a settlement before filing the lawsuit and that the laws relied upon by the power company were unconstitutional on due process grounds. The trial court rejected the defenses and approved the condemnation, but stayed the judgment pending appeal. The court affirmed the trial court. The court held that the trial court's order was appealable because otherwise it would divest a substantial right, and it would be beyond the power of the court to place the party in its former condition. The power company had a mandatory duty to negotiate under Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 73-276.15 (Repl. 1979). However, the negotiation was not jurisdictional in nature, and the power company's negotiation procedure met the requirements of the law. The letters received by the ranch provided inquiry notice and satisfied due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with raping a teenager who had been a regular babysitter for defendant and his wife for about two years when the alleged rape occurred. Defendant filed three pretrial motions. In the first, he requested a hearing on the relevancy of the alleged victim's prior sexual activities. In the second, he sought dismissal of the charge claiming that he had been denied his right to a speedy trial under Ark. R. Crim. P. 28. In the third motion, he asked the court to rule that the rape shield statute, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-1810.1 et seq., was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's rulings on the motions. Defendant's case was timely set for trial during the third term following his arrest, excluding the term in which he was arrested. The rape shield statute was constitutional in light of the legitimate state policies of protecting alleged victims from harassment and of aiding in crime prevention. Defendant's testimony that he had &quot;necked&quot; with the alleged victim and that they had fondled each other on numerous occasions was prohibited by the rape shield statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted based primarily on the victim's identification of him as the individual who had raped her. Defendant appealed his conviction and asserted that the sentence was improper because the jurors had not been given guidelines to follow during their sentencing deliberations. He also asserted that his motion for a mistrial should have been granted because the victim had impermissibly referred, during her testimony, to the fact that she had taken a polygraph test. In affirming, the court held that Arkansas only required jurors to be given sentencing guidelines in death penalty cases. The jury did not need to be provided guidelines because they would consider the factors emphasized by counsel when making their sentencing decision. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's mistrial motion because mistrial was a drastic measure and the trial court had promptly issued a cautionary instruction to the jury to ignore the victim's improper remarks.

The court found that the statute was found unconstitutional because it contained gender distinctions. Therefore, the parties were subject to the new act which required that all property would be returned to the party who owned it prior to marriage, and only property acquired after the marriage would be divided. Furthermore, the parties did not acquire any property subsequent to their marriage, and therefore the trial court correctly returned all the property to its original owner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a shopkeeper was robbed and killed, the trial court issued a warrant for the arrest of defendant. Executing the warrant, police officers forced open the front door and found defendant hiding in the attic. After defendant was taken into custody, the officers obtained a search warrant on the basis of an affidavit stating that the circumstances indicated that defendant concealed the murder weapon and money in the attic. After the court denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized in the search, defendant was convicted and sentenced to death on a capital murder charge. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that (1) there was probable cause to support the search warrant because the arrest warrant was valid, and the affidavit provided further sufficient information upon which to believe that the evidence sought was likely to be found on defendant's property; (2) a nighttime search was proper under Ark. R. Crim. P. 13.2(c)(ii) because the objects to be seized were in danger of imminent removal; and (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial based on alleged improper comments by the prosecutor.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-1808 (1977), and rape. He received a sentence of five years' imprisonment on the sexual abuse charge and life imprisonment on the rape charge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with sexually assaulting an eight year old victim, who was a neighbor's daughter. He was also charged with raping his 11-year-old daughter. He was found guilty on both charges. On appeal, the convictions were affirmed. The court rejected defendant's argument that he was denied due process of law under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments by the imposition of a life sentence because the jury exercised standardless sentencing discretion under Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-901(1)(a) (1977). There was no basis for his contention that his daughter suffered no psychological injury from defendant encouraging young male children to fondle and have sex with her. The absence of violent acts did not negate society's interest in punishing him for the crime. Defendant was in no position to challenge the jury instructions because he did not object to them. There was no requirement that a jury be given guidelines for the imposition of any sentence in any case other than one in which the death penalty may be imposed. The trial court did not commit reversible error by allowing defendant's expert to be cross-examined on the definition of pedophilia with statements from a text book.</SPAN></P>

Failure to obtain a desired verdict was not the test of effectiveness of counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a state mental health hospital committee, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Chancery Court of Pulaski County (Arkansas) alleging that his confinement in the state hospital was illegal. The chancery court held petitioner was being legally held pursuant to an order of commitment by a circuit court under Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-612 (1977). Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with first degree murder and was committed to the state hospital by the circuit court based on a medical report that he was suffering from psychosis. On motion for rehearing on sanity, the circuit court ruled that petitioner was not guilty by reason of mental disease and that he presented a danger to himself and others. He was committed to the state hospital pursuant to &sect; 41-612. In considering the habeas petition, the chancery court concluded that the circuit court's order was proper pursuant to Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-609 (1977). The supreme court reversed. Because petitioner was no longer subject to the sanctions of any criminal statutes, his post-acquittal confinement should have been ordered pursuant to Ark. Stat. Ann &sect; 59-408 (1977). Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-612 (1977) contained an implied limitation that prevented a person from being held indefinitely to the extent that the person was denied due process. Thus, a review of petitioner's case was necessary to determine if he could continue to be confined pursuant to the law relating to involuntary civil commitment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chancery court's ruling was reversed and the case was remanded with directions that civil commitment proceedings be immediately instituted to determine whether petitioner was a present danger to himself or the person or property of others.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers brought suit seeking an accounting and restitution of expense funds paid to the prosecutor. The taxpayers sought repayment of expenses incurred on behalf of another county and further alleged that some expense claims submitted by the prosecutor were fraudulent. The prosecutor caused $ 200 a month to be deposited into his personal bank account from monies appropriated for the office contingency expense fund. The trial court ordered the prosecuting attorney to reimburse the county $ 3,964.84. On appeal, the court held that: (1) where the legislature provided a lump sum expense payment to the prosecutor without requiring itemization or proof, the burden was on the taxpayers to show that the money was not used as expenses; (2) where Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24-114 (1962) did not mandate separation of expenses by county, the trial court's disallowance of the expenditure on behalf of another county was in error; and (3) where the taxpayers made a prima facie showing that a particular expense was not related to the duties of the prosecutor's office, in absence of some plausible explanation, the finding that the expenditures were not proper was sustainable.</SPAN></P>

Thirty-seven students in one part of the severed district attended school at the opposing district pursuant to an agreement between the parties.

Acts 390, which authorized a severed district to annex an adjoining district when the severed district was totally severed by a reservoir of 12,000 acres or more and the students in the severed district had to travel more than 35 miles round trip to attend school. The severed district sought to annex the area in which the 37 students lived. The opposing district filed an action challenging the constitutionality of 1979 Ark. Acts 390. The trial court held that the act was an unconstitutional local or special law. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. The court ruled that the classifications in 1979 Ark. Acts 390 were reasonably related to the purpose of the act. The court held that 1979 Ark.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a taxpayer and a group of independent voters, challenged a decision of the Pulaski County Chancery Court, Third Division (Arkansas), which, in appellants' taxpayers' lawsuit against appellee Arkansas Secretary of State, found that three proposed amendments to the Arkansas Constitution had been properly adopted by the state legislature and denied appellants' request for an injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In April 1979, the state legislature passed a resolution extending its regular session until January 1981. The legislature reconvened in January 1980 and, at that &quot;session,&quot; adopted three proposed constitutional amendments (a usury amendment, a jurisdiction amendment, and a property tax amendment). The legislature then recessed again, still not adjourning sine die. Appellants sought to prevent the secretary of state from placing the proposed amendments on the ballot in the general election of November 1980. The chancery court denied appellants' request for an injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court concluded that the actions of the legislature in January 1980 were not during a lawful extension of a regular session. The court held that the constitution limited the meeting of the state legislature to a regular biennial session that could only be extended to finish legislative work -- passing on legislation. The legislature could not extend itself indefinitely or meet at any and all times, monthly, biannually, or annually for any and all reasons. The legislature simply did not have that power under the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A majority of the court held that the usury amendment and the jurisdiction amendment were not proposed at a regular session of the state legislature and should not be placed on the ballot. A different majority held that the property tax amendment was properly proposed and should be placed on the ballot. The decree of the chancery court was therefore affirmed in part and reversed in part.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court found that it had considered the same issues the parties presented in this case in South Central District of the Pentecostal Church of God of America, Inc. v. Bruce-Rogers Co., and that the opinion in that case controlled the disposition of this case. The court found that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51-601 et seq. (Repl. 1971) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An automobile passenger was killed in a collision. The administrator filed a wrongful death action against the driver, alleging willful and wanton misconduct. The driver pled the guest statute, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-913. The testimony showed that the driver attempted to pass another vehicle as the car in front of him gave a signal for a left turn. Also, the driver's car, which belonged to his father, had two slick tires. The trial court granted the driver's motion for a directed verdict. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court properly concluded that there was not sufficient evidence of willful or wanton misconduct to submit to the jury. There was no evidence of adverse weather conditions or excess speed. There was no direct testimony that the driver was aware of the condition of the tires. The facts did not establish that the driver was attempting to pass with foreknowledge that the other vehicle was making a left turn. There did not appear to be any conscious failure to perform a manifest duty, although the decision to attempt to pass the vehicle turned out to be an unwise one. The court also affirmed the constitutionality of the guest statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a district of the Pentecostal Church, sought review from a decision of the Crawford Chancery Court (Arkansas), arguing that the chancery court erred in not holding that Act 146 of the General Assembly of 1895, as amended, digested as Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51-601 et seq. (Repl. 1971), was unconstitutional. The chancery court entered a decree granting a judgment to appellee, a supplier to a contractor engaged by appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Chancery court entered a decree granting a judgment to appellee, a supplier to a contractor engaged by appellant to install heating and air conditioning plants in a building owned by appellant. The judgment included a lien on the real estate improved by installation of the fixtures supplied. On appeal, appellant argued that the trial court erred in not holding that Act 146 was unconstitutional. The issue on appeal was whether the Arkansas mechanics' and materialmen's statutes met the due process requirements of the Arkansas Constitution. The court stated that state action was involved in the lien procedures and that there was a governmental interest in providing a procedure for the protection of mechanics from the danger of loss by disposition of the property to the value of which they had made substantial contribution. Further, the creditor seeking to establish a lien had an interest in the property which deserved consideration in the resolution of the due process question. The court concluded that the property interests affected where not of such a nature that minimum due process standards required more than the Arkansas statutes afforded in the way of notice and hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dentists were brothers who practiced as partners and who participated in the State of Arkansas Medicaid reimbursement program under which they provided dental care to eligible patients, and payments were made by the State. The Board charged that the dentists had committed immoral, dishonorable, or scandalous conduct by submitting statements to the State for dental services claimed they performed on Medicaid patients but which had not been performed, for professional incompetence, and for performing unnecessary dental services. The Board revoked the dentists' licenses, and the circuit court affirmed. The dentists appealed, and the court modified. The circuit court did not err in refusing to admit the results of polygraph examinations. The evidence was sufficient to support the decision of the Board, and the language of &sect; 72-560(3) was not unconstitutionally vague. However, the Board in affixing punishment for the dentists acted arbitrarily in the sense that the penalty was extremely harsh and unreasonable when all the facts were considered. Although the dentists acted improperly, the State program was fraught with administrative problems, and many dentists abused its laxness.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-1211 was unconstitutional. The lower court denied the ex-husband this relief because his plea of unconstitutionality was set forth too late. The ex-husband appealed. On appeal, the court confirmed that the ex-husband had not raised the issue of unconstitutionality in time. The court noted that the repealed statute violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution by imposing alimony obligations on husbands, but not wives. In this case, however, the award of alimony was binding on the ex-husband by reason of his failure to raise the question of constitutionality prior to the entry of that order. The ex-wife's rights to alimony were vested by the decree of the lower court. The court concluded that where a judgment was based upon rights conferred by a statute later declared unconstitutional, the doctrine of res judicata barred the relitigation of the case in which it was rendered, or the reopening of the judgment after it became final.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect;&sect; 30-207, 30-209 (1979) allowed the debtor to select the items, which he wished to claim as exempt. There was nothing in these provisions, which would prohibit the debtor from selecting money or wages due as part or all of his exemptions. Likewise, there was no reason why the debtor could not schedule both money and property as exempt so long as the total did not exceed the $ 500 limit. It was proper for the debtor to amend his schedule of exemptions. The court did not find it necessary to rule on the constitutionality of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-207 in view of its opinion that the debtor properly and legally claimed both money and personal property in his schedule. It was not necessary for the creditor to obtain an additional writ because the writ of garnishment properly applied to any of the debtor's scheduled property above the $ 500 exemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee wife was granted a divorce from appellant husband on her counterclaim. The White County Chancery Court (Arkansas) awarded the wife permanent alimony, attorney's fees, and a statutory interest in the husband's real and personal property pursuant to Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect;34-1211 and 34-1214 (Repl. 1962). The husband appealed from the final decree, arguing that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect;34-1211 and 34-1214 (Repl. 1962) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the entry of the decree, the court, in another appeal, held that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-1210, which authorized temporary maintenance and attorney's fees for the wife, was held to be unconstitutional as violative of equal protection rights. The husband argued that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-1211 (Repl. 1962) was unconstitutional for the same reasons. The court held that &sect; 34-1211 was unconstitutionally gender-based. Because the husband, for the first time on appeal, raised the constitutionality of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-1214, which pertained to a wife's property rights upon divorce, the court could not consider it. 1979 Ark. Acts 705, which amended Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 34-1210, 34-1211, 34-1213, and 34-1214 by making them gender-neutral rather than gender-based, was not available to the trial court, as it could not be retroactively applied. Thus, there was no statutory law that the trial court could have applied to award alimony, property, or attorney's fees to the wife. Thus, the trial court, sitting as a court in equity, had the inherent power to make the awards to the wife.</SPAN></P>

The wife contested the chancery court's distribution of the real and personal property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Most, if not all, of the real and personal property of the parties was acquired during their 33-year marriage. The wife worked the farm, drove a tractor, hauled hay, picked beans, and other farm chores, in addition to her normal housewife duties until their children were grown. The wife then obtained part-time work in the city and her salary was used in the general family operation. After the parties separated, they reconciled upon the husband's promise to buy the wife a home in the city, which was purchased by his father. The husband told the wife that the home belonged to them and they lived there until the divorce. The wife challenged the chancery court's distribution of property in their divorce action. The court reversed, concluding that the deed to the husband's father was an equitable mortgage based on past dealings and the conduct of the parties and that the wife jointly owned all real and personal property based on the joint efforts of acquiring it during the marriage, despite the fact that it was titled solely in the husband's name.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order affirming the municipal court conviction was entered after defendant failed to appear on the date his case was called in the circuit court. Defendant appeared one hour after his case was called, but the circuit court refused to set aside the affirmance of the conviction. Defendant's attorney was present when defendant's case was called, but the circuit court refused to allow him to enter a plea on defendant's behalf. Defendant asserted that he never received proper notice of the time and date for his appearance in violation of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-311 (1962). The court reversed. The evidence showed that prior to the hearing date, a bench warrant was issued for defendant. The warrant was apparently meant to provide notice to defendant, but it was never served. The original affidavit for appeal simply stated that defendant was to appear on the first day of the next regular term of the circuit court, which he did. Further, defendant's counsel should have been allowed to enter a plea for defendant even though defendant was not present when his case was called. And, the State admitted that prejudicial error existed that required reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State, via its prosecuting attorney, filed a petition for the abatement of the dance hall as a public nuisance, pursuant to Act 118 of 1937, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-111 et seq. (Repl. 1962). The trial court, without notice or a hearing, ordered that the dance hall be temporarily padlocked. The trial court extended its order pending a permanent hearing. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment, which had extended the temporary injunction, and remanded the case with directions for the trial court to dissolve the injunction and return possession of the dance hall to the owners. The court held that Act 118 of 1937 was unconstitutional because it authorized a temporary or permanent injunction without affording the owners of the dance hall an opportunity for notice and a hearing in violation of the owners' due process rights under the federal constitution and the Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 21. The court also noted that the record clearly showed that there was no threat to life, liberty, or property, at the time the injunction was issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were married for 25 years. The wife helped the husband through medical school, then raised their two now adult sons. The husband was a successful psychiatrist, while the wife was attending college to secure a business degree. The chancery court refused to award alimony because the wife was employed as a secretary and was entitled to draw income from the corpus of an insurance trust. When awarding alimony, proper consideration should have been given to the financial condition of the parties, the wife's financial needs, the wife's ability to support herself, the station in life of the parties, and the character of the parties on the cause of the separation. The court held that the wife was entitled to alimony because her income as a secretary did not meet her financial needs and the trust could not be drawn upon until after the husband's death. The husband argued that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-1211 (Repl. 1962) was gender based and therefore unconstitutional. The court could not consider that argument because it was raised for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of felony murder for his role in the offense. He faced the death penalty, but was instead sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court first determined that the trial court acted properly in excluding prospective jurors who stated that they would not impose the death penalty under any circumstances. The court also found that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction. The court noted, inter alia, that defendant admitted that he was at the gas station at the time of the robbery and that his gun was used to kill the clerk. Further, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for continuance because defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced thereby. The court also rejected defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of the Arkansas procedure permitting a prosecutor to file an information directly in circuit court. The court also found that defendant, having been sentenced to life imprisonment, lacked standing to challenge the capital punishment statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authority sought to have its property rezoned to commercial use because it was bounded on all four sides by commercial uses, because the authority had failed to attract a single bid for the property when it was offered for sale, and it did not want to accept the city's offer to take the property in exchange for its payment of related debt. When the city planning commission denied the authority's application for rezoning and the city council affirmed that denial, the authority appealed to the circuit court, which held that the city's action was arbitrary and unreasonable. Having so held, the circuit court ordered the application granted. The city appealed but the court modified the order. Noting that the chancellor heard the evidence and inspected the property, after which he determined that the city's action was arbitrary, the court upheld the chancellor's ruling. The record supported the conclusion that the city actually wanted to obtain title to the subject property, after which it would rezone it to commercial use, that the possibility that rezoning would create a traffic problem was an insufficient basis for refusing rezoning, and that its refusal decision was arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

The department claimed that the interest income should have been apportioned among all states in which the taxpayer did business. The court reversed the lower court's decision and held that the interest constituted business income as defined in Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 84-2055(a). The court noted that the loans were made regularly and consistently and enabled the related corporations to provide services for the taxpayer. The funds for the loans was working capital which was derived from the taxpayer's income earned in all states where it had retail operations, and the interest went back into the working capital. The loan transactions therefore were in the regular course of the taxpayer's business operations. The court also held that taxation of the interest income did not violate the Commerce Clause or due process.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 56-128(h)(2), on which the lower court's order was based, was unconstitutionally vague in that the term, &quot;a proper home,&quot; did not provide sufficient guidelines to meet the due process requirements of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ark. Const. art II, &sect; 8, where the termination of parental rights was involved. The court found that Ark. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed that he was entitled to inherit a portion of the deceased's estate. The probate court denied the claim on the basis that appellant was an illegitimate child and as such was unable to inherit under Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61-141 (Repl. 1971). Upon review, the court reversed. The court found that &sect; 61-141 was unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because the classification limiting the right of an illegitimate child to inherit from his father bore no rational relationship to any legitimate state interest. The court held that appellant had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute where appellant had alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy. The court determined that an amendment to &sect; 61-141 that was intended to satisfy constitutional requirements had no application to the pending proceedings where there was no express declaration or necessary implication that the amendment was to apply retroactively. The court concluded the right of appellant to inherit accrued when the decedent died and that such right could not be impaired by subsequent legislation.</SPAN></P>

This statute was almost identical to the Illinois statute that was declared unconstitutional on equal protection grounds by the U.S. Supreme Court. Appellant contended that she was the illegitimate child of decedent and in view of the Supreme Court decision in Trimble, she inherited the 400 acres of land as decedent's sole heir. The trial court held that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61-141(d) (Repl. 1971) was unconstitutional in view of Trimble. The trial court also found that appellant was the illegitimate child of decedent, but she was not within the class of illegitimates who was permitted to inherit from the father, because there was no semblance of a parent-child relationship nor was there a formal order establishing paternity.

On appeal, the former wife argued that she was entitled to one-third of the former husband's personal property and one-third of his real estate for life without reference as to how the property was acquired. The court held that the former husband's wealth was substantially in excess of the former wife's wealth and that the former wife was entitled to the one-third allotment. The former wife was entitled to one-fourth of the former husband's interest in a trust because he had a personal property interest in the trust. The court ruled that because it had modified the property division, it could not say that the child support and alimony award was presently inadequate to meet the needs of the former wife and the children.</SPAN></P>

The board had instituted an action with the Commission asking that the Assessment Coordination Division order a reassessment where property would be taxed uniformly at its market value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board argued against the constitutionality of 1973 Ark. Acts 411 and 1969 Ark. Acts 188, which was dependent on the meaning of Ark. Const. art. 16, &sect; 5. Ark. Const.&nbsp;art. 16, &sect; 5 required that all property subject to taxation be taxed according to its value. The court held that the constitutional requirement meant &quot;present value,&quot; because its value in some other year would almost certainly not be the same as the current value and, if some other basis was used, would not be its true value at all. The court held that, in past constitutions, the general assembly could select the method for equalizing assessments and for reaching the true value of property, but could not assign the value of the property. Therefore, the court found that Act 411 was unconstitutional because it provided for the assessment at artificial values and not at its market value. The court found that Act 188 violated the constitution because it sought to tax property in an unequal fashion.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial judge improperly assumed that the jury returned a verdict for actual damages, an assumption that could not be made in the face of an unequivocal instruction for it to decide damages and then triple them.

The court noted that petitioner was afforded the opportunity to address the trial court before sentencing and it held the procedure in substantial compliance with Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43-2303 (Repl. 1977). Rejecting petitioner's other argument, the court noted that he was not charged, tried, convicted, or sentenced under any statute prescribing a capital felony, with a sentence of life imprisonment without parole, or a life felony without parole. Petitioner was eligible for release on parole under the conditions of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43-2807 (Repl. 1977). The court emphasized that the scope of review was limited to the provisions of Ark. R. Crim. P. 37, and the jurisdiction of the trial court to reduce petitioner's sentence under Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43-2310 expired. The court added that if the penalty was too severe, it was a matter for executive clemency.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged by information with the offense of capital murder of two individuals and that they also robbed and kidnapped the victims. The press released between 250 and 300 stories that went out to more than 100 newspapers. Defendants were subsequently found guilty of capital murder and sentenced to death by electrocution. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that defendants would have been more likely to have received a more fair and impartial trial had the change of venue been granted. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to grant the motion for a change of venue, and that constituted prejudicial error. The court saw no error in the granting of a motion to quash the subpoena for the press because it was too much of a burden to place upon a witness given the number of stories issued. Further, the court stated that the seating of the jury constituted reversible error because the jury did not meet the requirements of U.S. Const. XIV nor Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendants' convictions and capital sentences for murder.</SPAN></P>

Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the trial court committed reversible error in failing to instruct the jury on lesser-included offenses down through manslaughter. Given the amount of evidence presented on such lesser-included offenses, the case should not have gone to the jury with only one possible conviction -- capital murder. Moreover, in order to prove his insanity defense, defendant was entitled to receive material records relating to his two prior commitments in the state hospital. Furthermore, the trial judge's remarks to the jury on the power of the governor to pardon were prejudicial and reversible error. Finally, the trial court's instructions erroneously allowed the jury to find two aggravating circumstances for the same act -- defendant's attempt to avoid arrest. Therefore, defendant was entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife claimed that if &sect; 34-1210 was deemed unconstitutional, the court should simply hold that it applied to both wives and husbands. The husband claimed that &sect; 34-1210 was unconstitutional because it only applied to wives. The court held that &sect; 34-1210 was unconstitutional and that it was not its function to legislate in order to apply the statute to both wives and husbands. The court found that to withstand scrutiny under the equal protection clause, classifications by gender had to serve important governmental objectives and had to be substantially related to achievement of those objectives. The gender-based classification was unnecessary and the state's purposes could be effectuated without it; therefore, the court declared &sect; 34-1210 unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection provisions of the United States and the Arkansas constitutions. The court noted that it would not apply the law to both wives and husbands, stating that would be a violation of its authority and it was a function of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

At the outset, the court acknowledged that portions of the relevant statute had been determined to be constitutional. However, the court noted that the prior state decisions did not address the precise question of whether the state could constitutionally make it a criminal offense for a person to possess an obscene film within the confines of his own home. The court found, however, that the United States Supreme Court had determined that the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibited making mere private possession of obscene material a crime. The court found that this decision, which protected the home area from governmental intrusion, was controlling. As such, the court ruled that the portions of &sect;&sect; 41-3578 and 41-3580 that attempted to make the mere private possession of obscene material a crime constituted an unconstitutional invasion of an individual's First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyers had an undivided one-fourth interest in some 380 acres that they purchased from several heirs. The majority property owner was a 90 year-old woman whose family had owned the land for several generations. She alleged that a commissioner and a guardian ad litem serving in the case were interested parties in the purchase of the land and, therefore, the sale was void under Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-1830 (Repl. 1962). She also claimed that the court improperly awarded an attorney's fee to a pro se party. The trial court granted the buyers an undivided one-fourth interest in the property and entered an order confirming the sale. The trial court found no procedural defects. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part, holding that there was a potential conflict of interest and ordering a hearing as to whether the sale was void. It found that the action was resisted by the property owner and the buyers conceded that they bought the property with the intention of having it partitioned and making a profit. It would also be unfair to penalize the property owner by adding to the costs of the proceeding an attorney's fee for a party that represented himself.</SPAN></P>

The corporation alleged that the director was charged with the administration of the act in question and lacked the requisite standing or authority to challenge its constitutionality. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that there was no merit to the corporation's argument. In support, the court held that a public official could question the constitutionality of a legislative enactment where public interests or public rights were involved, as distinguished from individual rights, and no enabling legislation was necessary. Further, the court held that the requisite public rights and public interest to existed. The court also found that the assessments due for the period involved were mature and payable. The court held that the state had a claim for taxes from the date the taxes were due and payable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ordinance No. 63 made an appropriation for the support of the public defender's office. The county judge contended that the circuit court was without jurisdiction of the petition and that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) the circuit judge did not have the interest in the case that would require a transfer of the case simply because an order entered by him was involved or questioned in the case; (2) it was not necessary that a specific request for approval of the disbursement of funds for the salaries in question be made of the county judge as a condition precedent to the bringing of the action; (3) it could hardly be said that the remedy by appeal in the situation was adequate or complete, as utilizing the remedy of appeal would probably result in the demise of the public defender system while that remedy was being pursued; (4) the appointment of a public defender was no more an executive function than was the appointment of an attorney to represent an indigent in an individual case; and (5) there was no logical basis for saying that furnishing defense counsel to indigent defendants was not a part of the administration of justice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of rape. He appealed, citing numerous alleged errors. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that there was substantial evidence that the rape occurred in Arkansas. The court found that, before the State had to offer any evidence on the question of jurisdiction, there must have been positive evidence that the offense occurred outside the jurisdiction. In addition, the court opined that it was not essential to prosecution in Arkansas that all the elements of the crime charged took place in Arkansas. The court articulated that the evidence supported a ruling as to the voluntariness of defendant's confession despite the claimed assurance by interrogating officers that the statement could be withdrawn and despite the claim that the statement was induced by a promise that defendant would be given an opportunity for a polygraph examination. The court held that there was no constitutional prohibition against the interrogator trying to persuade defendant to tell the truth or to answer questions, even though there were misrepresentations of fact by the interrogator. The court found no merit in defendant's remaining contentions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an African American who sought to be appointed as an administrator of a decedent's estate, sought review of a judgment of the Phillips Probate Court (Arkansas), which held that proffered testimony regarding appellant's alleged illegitimacy was inadmissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's birth certificate listed his mother and her husband as his parents. Later, the decedent, who was an African American man of substantial means, died. Appellant filed a petition to be appointed as administrator of the decedent's estate on the ground that the decedent was his natural father. At trial, appellant offered his mother's indication that he was the decedent's father and presented witnesses who testified that the decedent had sometimes referred to appellant as his son. On appeal from the probate court's ruling that the proffered evidence was inadmissible, appellant contended that the state's statutes and rules of evidence that created a presumption of legitimacy were unconstitutional because they made it more difficult for illegitimate blacks to prove the identity of their fathers. In affirming the probate court's judgment, the court held that appellant's proffered evidence was not admissible. The court upheld the constitutionality of the presumption of legitimacy because it made it difficult for both illegitimate blacks and whites to prove legitimacy. Just because more blacks were illegitimate than whites did not tip the scales of discrimination against blacks.</SPAN></P>

It filed a petition for a writ of prohibition to prevent the judge from proceeding further in the suit, arguing that the customer failed to offer any evidence of jurisdiction. The court denied the petition, holding that the burden of proof was on the manufacturer, as the party seeking to quash the summons, to show that it did not have sufficient contacts with the state to justify the suit against it. It did not meet that burden of proof. The court also held that it was not clear from the record that the trial court did not have jurisdiction, so prohibition was not clearly warranted.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 41-3401 (Repl. 1964), that was entered by the Craighead Circuit Court, Jonesboro District, Criminal Division (Arkansas).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the second trial, the trial court ruled that defendant could not cross-examine the victim regarding her previous sexual conduct. The ruling was based upon 1977 Ark. Acts 197, which had been passed after defendant's first trial, but prior to defendant's second trial. Pursuant to 1977 Ark. Acts 197, inquiry into the victim's sexual history was prohibited absent a finding of relevance in a pre-trial hearing. The court ruled that the trial court refusal to permit defendant to inquiry into evidence regarding the victim's virginity did not constitute reversible error. At the outset, the court noted that evidence of virginity was not per se relevant in a rape case. Moreover, the court observed that defendant did not proffer any extrinsic evidence regarding the victim's sexual history to determine prejudice. The court found that defendant's failure to make a proffer precluded defendant from raising the issue on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 17 prohibited law professors, associate professors, and instructors at from performing legal work outside of their teaching responsibilities, but it did not prohibit distinguished professors, assistant professors, and lecturers from performing legal work outside of their teaching responsibilities. There was no substantial difference in the duties of the professors, associate professors, and assistant professors, although there was a difference in qualifications and salaries among the positions. The language of Act 569, 1975 Ark. Gen. Assembly only referred to one law school, but a university president applied the Act to the two law schools sponsored by the university. The lower court held that assistant professors were instructors under the Act and held that the Act was constitutional. The court reversed, holding under the Act that assistant professors were not instructors. Thus, the Act violated the Equal Protection Clause because there was no reasonable basis for distinguishing between assistant professors, and professors, and full professors in deciding which class of professors was permitted to perform outside work.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the holding that the city court was a constitutional court, because the mayor could appoint a judge and render the city court constitutional. The court reversed the trial court's the holding that the safeguards and practices used by the mayor as judge of the court fully met the requirements of due process of law, as was the portion of the judgment prescribing arraignment procedures for the mayor, sitting as judge of the court. The mayor's interest in city finances, fines, and forfeitures invoked prohibitions against holding two inconsistent positions. The city court, with its mayor presiding, deprived the arrestees of due process. The situation was not remedied by a transfer because exclusive jurisdiction of cases involving violations of city ordinances was vested in the city court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner litigants requested a writ of mandamus be issued against respondents ordering them to withdraw and void all permits issued to private clubs under 1969 Ark. Acts 132. The parties stipulated that the sole legal issue raised in the case was the validity of permits issued to private clubs in counties which were &quot;dry&quot; under 1942 Ark. Acts 1. The trial court opined that 1969 Ark. Acts 132 violated the Arkansas Constitution in that it amended 1942 Ark. Acts 1, an initiated act, by granting authority to issue permits for the dispensing of alcoholic beverages to private clubs in &quot;dry&quot; territories. No authority for issuance of such permits existed under the initiated measure. The trial court stated that mandamus was the proper remedy for the subject matter of this suit. The court disagreed. The court held that mandamus was not the proper procedure. The court held that an action for a declaratory judgment would have provided the answer to the question of whether the 1969 Ark. Act 132 was valid under the Arkansas Constitution. The court also held the litigants were attempting to enforce an alleged duty which was not a plain ministerial duty for which a writ of mandamus could issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed the clerk at a shoe store and then robbed the cash register. As a result, he was arrested, found guilty of murder in the commission of a robbery, and sentenced to death by electrocution. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction but modified the judgment to a finding of guilt of life felony-murder with a sentence of life imprisonment without parole unless the Attorney General elected to request a remand for a new trial. The court held that: (1) the dismissal of veniremen for their refusal to consider the death penalty was appropriate; (2) the admission of defendant's confession as voluntary was not clearly against the preponderance of the evidence; and (3) sufficient evidence supported the jury's finding of two aggravating circumstances. However, held the court, the entire record indicated that, because of imbecility and organic brain syndrome, the crime was committed while defendant's capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental disease or defect. Hence, the jury erred in failing to find any mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's conviction of defendant for murder in the commission of a robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was 19 years old, he committed a homicide during a robbery. After defendant was convicted of felony murder and given the death penalty, he appealed and the court affirmed his conviction. Upon an appeal to the United States Supreme Court, the Court vacated his conviction and remanded the action for consideration of whether defendant had received meaningful appellate review as required by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court again affirmed his conviction and sentence, holding that in the absence of a statutory mechanism, a defendant convicted of a capital crime could still receive adequate appellate review. Further, the jury's finding of an aggravating circumstance, that the murder was committed for pecuniary gain, was supported by substantial evidence of a robbery. Although defendant may have been young, the jury was justified in finding that his youth was not a mitigating factor because he had passed the state of adolescence and juvenility. Finally, there was a sound basis to find that defendant was not suffering from a mental disorder or defect despite low IQ results as a child because there was testimony that the robbery was carefully planned.</SPAN></P>

It was not necessary that the officer actually responded violently and it was immaterial that he did not respond in that fashion. Moreover, the court held that defendant had failed to object to the jury instruction on this point and, having failed to object or to request an another instruction, she had waived the objection for the purposes of this appeal.</SPAN></P>

The conviction and death sentence were initially upheld by the court. Thereafter, defendant filed a petition for writ of certiorari review with the Supreme Court of the United States. That court vacated the court's judgment, insofar as it left undisturbed the death penalty imposed, and ordered that the cause be remanded to the court for further constitutional consideration. The court's consideration of the imposition of the death penalty lead the court to the same conclusion that the court had reached when the case was previously considered, i.e., that the statute under which the death penalty was imposed was constitutional and valid. The court found, among other things, that the death penalty statute was constitutional even though it did not provide for a mandatory or automatic appeal. The court further found that the pertinent issues had been properly submitted to the jury, whose verdict was sustained by the evidence, and that death by electrocution was not unconstitutionally cruel.

The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance prohibited the use of attraction devices or signs that flashed, blinked or were animated. Non-conforming signs were required to have been made conforming within seven years of the passage of the ordinance. The city argued that the use of such signs damaged the city's scenic resources and thus the city's economic base. The trial court ruled that the seven year amortization period was unconstitutional as applied to prior non-conforming uses. The court found that the right of property was before and higher than any constitutional sanction, Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 22. A property owner had a vested right in a non-conforming use that dd not threaten public health or safety. Thus, the city's amortization provision as applied to on-going businesses that did not threaten public health or safety was unconstitutional as a taking without compensation in violation of art. 2, &sect; 22. However, the ordinance's ban against flashing and blinking signs was legitimately related to public health and welfare and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal defendant contended that the first-degree battery statute, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-1601(1)(c) (1976), on its face and as applied to him, was unconstitutionally vague, and also defective because the culpable mental state necessary to warrant a conviction was not set out therein. Defendant argued that a statutory phrase did not provide sufficient notice to the accused or the jury of the acts or conduct prohibited by the statute. The court found defendant's objection without merit because Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-204(2) (1976) clearly provided a culpable mental state must be proved. The court in its instruction imposed the highest burden upon the State, requiring the State to prove the conduct of defendant was done purposely instead of knowingly or recklessly. There was sufficient notice in the words of the statute to indicate the type of conduct proscribed. The language of the Arkansas statute did not require reasonable men to speculate as to its common understanding or application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee brought a claim for workmen's compensation benefits with the commission while working for the employer.

The employee argued that &sect; 15, in allowing the employer to bypass the circuit court, was unconstitutional. The court remanded to the commission to transmit the appeal to the appropriate circuit court. The court noted that pursuant to Ark. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4, the court only had appellate jurisdiction to review an order of an inferior court. Because the commission was an administrative agency that could not enforce its own orders, it was not a &quot;court,&quot; and therefore the court could not directly review its decisions. Thus &sect; 15 of the Act was unconstitutional in allowing the court to directly review of commission decisions. Further, Ark. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank filed suit for a deficiency judgment for the balance of the debt owed by the company. The trial court granted judgment to the bank, and the company appealed, arguing that an agreement for disposal of collateral should have been held invalid, that the bank failed to give notice of repossession of the automobiles, that the repossession was in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 21 (1874), and that the bank should have been barred from a deficiency judgment. The court affirmed. The company signed a disposal of collateral agreement after the repossession of the cars by the bank, and thus the agreement to dispose of collateral was valid. Pursuant to Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 85-1-102 (Add. 1961), 85-9-501(1)(3) (Supp. 1975), 85-9-504(3) (Supp. 1975), a debtor could waive notification of the sale following a default. The bank was not required to give notice of the repossession, because under Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 85-9-503 a party could proceed without judicial process if this was done without any breach of the peace. The repossession was not unconstitutional, as enactment of a self-help statute created no cause of action under the civil rights acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution of defendant resulted from an accident that occurred when defendant's car left a road, entered a ditch, and struck a 13 year old boy who was playing in the ditch. The boy suffered injuries. Defendant was found guilty of battery in the second degree. On appeal, he argued that &sect; 41-1602(1)(d) was vague and overbroad because it did not set a clear standard for reckless conduct. The court found that the statute was not overbroad in that it required that defendant: (1) was reckless; (2) caused serious physical injury; and (3) used a deadly weapon. The court explained that the criminal code provided a detailed definition for each of the required elements of battery in the second degree and that these definitions were included in the instructions to the jury. The court held that substantial evidence sustained the conviction in that a witness testified that he saw defendant's car traveling &quot;pretty fast&quot; and saw the car hit the victim. The court noted that other witnesses testified that they smelled alcohol on defendant immediately after the accident. The court found that the child's injuries were serious and that the car could have constituted a weapon under the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board had granted a conditional charter to the association pending the association's obtaining of insurance from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) before commencing business, as set forth in &sect; 67-1831 of the Savings and Loan Association Act, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 67-1801 through 67-1862. The association was unable to obtain FSLIC approval. The association obtained one charter extension, but a second extension was denied. The Board affirmed the cancellation of the association's conditional charter. The court found that the Act did not require an association to procure an indemnity bond or pay annual fees for commencing business. Further the requirement for FSLIC insurance was for &quot;carrying on business&quot; rather than commencing business. The court reversed the finding that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 67-1831 was unconstitutional because the provision did not tell or request the FSLIC to do anything. Thus, there was no improper delegation of authority. The court found that the association was entitled to an extension to its charter because it showed good cause for its delay in commencing business based upon the FSLIC's refusal to provide insurance to the association.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded for the entry of a judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder while engaged in the perpetration of rape in violation of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-4702(A) (1973). The court affirmed his conviction. Although defendant challenged the constitutionality of the death penalty under Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 9, and the Eighth Amendment, this matter was moot because he was sentenced to life imprisonment. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court should not have excused for cause jurors that refused to consider the death penalty and found no abuse of discretion in its decision refusing defendant's motion for a continuance to obtain the attendance of an absent witness. To obtain such a continuance a movant was required to support his motion by affidavit stating what facts he believed the witness would prove and in the case of an expert witness the movant was required to state the basis of his opinion. Defendant's conviction was supported by substantial evidence and errors that the trial court made in the admission of evidence were found harmless. The court found that the trial court had not abused its discretion when it refused to declare a mistrial in the face of an outburst by the victim's relative.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the Act and the Commission's regulations were valid. Appellants challenged the trial court's findings. On appeal, the court affirmed. The billboard signs at issue were erected without permits and were thus in violation of the statutory requirements. The court found that there was not an unlawful delegation of legislative power to the Commission in authorizing it to promulgate regulations for the billboards. The Commission promulgated regulations pursuant to its well-defined scope of authority. The court found that the classification found in Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 76-2501 et seq. (Supp. 1975) was reasonable and valid. Section 76-2501 gave compensation to owners of billboards that were standing prior to the enactment of the statute but not to those that were erected after. There were differences in the legal interests of the owners of prior nonconforming uses and later illegally initiated uses. Thus, there was no equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a patient and his wife, sought review of a judgment of the Craighead Circuit Court (Arkansas), which granted motions for summary judgment to defendants, physicians, hospital employees, and the hospital's insurer, in appellants' medical malpractice action. The motions were based on the statute of limitations of two years in Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37-205 (1962).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient continued to have medical problems six years after he had surgery, and an X-ray revealed that a hemostat had been left in the patient's abdomen. The physicians stated that they had no knowledge or suspect the presence of the hemostat, and no employee concealed the presence of the hemostat from the patient or anyone else. Appellants relied on the theory of continuing tort to prevent the bar of &sect; 37-205. On appeal, the court found that continuing tort did not apply under the statute. The two-year period began from the date of the wrongful act, which was the date of the surgery. Section 37-205 was not unconstitutional. The court would not interfere with the statutory period unless the statutory time was so short to amount to a practical denial of the right to bring the action. Two years was not an unreasonably short period of time for appellants to have discovered and asserted their cause of action absent fraudulent concealment.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 6, &sect; 18, which vested the power to grant pardons, reprieves and commutations of sentences in the governor. The court found that the statute did not violate the constitution. Defendant next contended that his confession was involuntary as a matter of law and fact under the undisputed evidence and therefore was inadmissible. The court disagreed, finding that the testimony of an officer was sufficient to overcome the presumption against voluntariness. There was no evidence to indicate that any officer struck defendant or used any physical force on him. Defendant challenged the admission of certain photographs showing the bodies of the victims of a very brutal assault because, he contended, their only purpose was to inflame the minds of the jury.

Acts 438 was valid, that the issues were properly submitted to the jury, and that the verdict was sustained by the evidence. The state's view of the death penalty was that all serious felonies of the same kind, such as murder, were not identical either as to the gravity of the offense or as to the moral culpability of the offender. Statutes defining non-capital offenses customarily allowed the jury some discretion in the assessment of punishment, such as a sentence to imprisonment ranging from one to 21 years. The court did not read a Supreme Court decision on capital punishment as prohibiting an exercise of discretion in the imposition or non-imposition of capital punishment, if the choice was made reasonably. The ultimate issue submitted was whether the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that sufficient aggravating circumstances existed to justify a sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the decision of the Pulaski Circuit Court (Arkansas), which, upon a jury verdict, convicted defendant of capital felony murder in violation of Ark.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another man robbed a service station, bound the victim's hands and feet and then shot him. After leaving the station, defendant and his accomplice returned a short time later and upon discovering the wounded attendant using the phone, defendant shot and killed the attendant. On appeal, defendant contended that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-4711 and 41-4712 (Supp. 1973), which permitted the jury to consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances, were so vague as to be constitutionally defective. The thrust of defendant's argument was that a criminal statute must be sufficiently specific to inform men of reasonable intelligence of the criminal act or omission. In defendant's case, the jury found in the bifurcated trial that only one aggravating circumstance existed, the offense was committed for a pecuniary gain. The court held that the terminology or phrase in the challenged statute was a matter of such common understanding and practice that it could not be said that an ordinary man or juror would have to speculate as to its meaning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation, which was not licensed to do business in Arkansas, sold a mobile home to a dealer, the bank financed the sale, the dealer defaulted, the bank brought a tort and contract action in its home county to collect the debt, and the circuit court dismissed the complaint for lack of venue. The court reversed the dismissal and found that, because a contract action was involved, the corporation fell within Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27-619 (Supp. 1973), which provided that venue was proper in the bank's county. Because the stipulated facts in conjunction with the pleadings reflected that the cause of action alleged the breach of express and implied warranties, the court found that the complaint raised contract issues for purposes of venue under &sect; 27-619. The court further found that &sect; 27-619 did not deprive the corporation of equal protection because, as a foreign corporation not qualified to do business in Arkansas, it was subject to a separate venue classification. The corporation lacked standing to challenge &sect; 27-619 on the ground that it did not distinguish between foreign corporations that were qualified to do business in Arkansas and those that were not qualified.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that his rights were violated when his attorney was not notified of a pretrial lineup that was held one week prior to the trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased and her husband were shot during a robbery of their service station. The trial court suppressed all facts and statements pertaining to the lineup. The husband identified defendant. The trial court convicted defendant of murder. The court reversed and remanded. The identification of defendant turned on the husband's testimony alone. The lineup was conducted to crystallize the witness' identification of defendant for future reference. The error was not harmless when there was absolutely no other evidence to connect defendant with the crime, and defendant was deprived of his attorney's ability to cross-examine the husband about the lineup from personal observation of the proceeding. The court held that an in-chambers hearing should have been conducted to determine the admissibility of in-court identification testimony whenever an objection was made on the ground that it was tainted by an unconstitutional pretrial identification lineup. The court held that the State had not met its burden of proof on the admissibility of the identification. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to show cause of death.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that &sect; 70-802 did not apply to a franchise existing between the assignee and the corporation. On appeal, the assignee contended that the lower court erred in holding &sect; 70-802 inapplicable to the subject franchise agreement because the plain meaning of the language of the statute and a construction of the statute in light of the legislative intent required it to apply to the subject franchise agreement. Such construction circumvented the social benefit to be achieved by the statute. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court.

In defendant's jury trial for criminal libel, the circuit court refused instructions that defendant's comments about the sheriff were privileged unless made with actual knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for whether the comments were false or not. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction for criminal libel by holding that the Arkansas criminal libel statute, Ark. Stat.

P. 1 after the St. Francis Circuit Court (Arkansas) revoked his suspended 10-year sentence upon his release from jail where he had been held in lieu of a fine on a conviction for assault and battery in which he was not represented by counsel. At issue was whether an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction could be used as the sole basis for revoking a suspended sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been convicted of burglary and grand larceny and received a 10-yer suspended sentence. Less than a month later he was arrested on assault and battery charges filed by his neighbor, with whom he had an altercation concerning defendant's wife. Defendant pled not guilty to the assault and battery charges and was tried before the municipal court without benefit of counsel. He was found guilty and fined, but defendant chose jail in lieu of the fine. Within hours of his release from jail defendant was arrested pursuant to a warrant issued on the State's request for revocation of the suspended sentence. Counsel was appointed but the trial court revoked the suspended sentence. Defendant did not appeal the revocation but sought post-conviction relief. The court stated that pursuant to Supreme Court jurisprudence, a person could not be incarcerated for any offense, whether misdemeanor or felony, unless he was represented by counsel, and concluded that an uncounseled conviction could not be used for the purpose of revoking a suspended sentence because the net effect would be the actual deprivation of a person's liberty without the guiding hand of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court that revoked defendant's suspended sentence on the basis of defendant's subsequent uncounseled misdemeanor conviction for assault and battery. The court remanded with directions that the lower court set aside the revocation.</SPAN></P>

Trial was set and since defendant had not obtained counsel he was granted a continuance. Trial was reset and defendant advised the trial court he had obtained counsel. Defendant's counsel filed and was granted a motion for a continuance. Defendant then filed a motion to dismiss his counsel and for a continuance to obtain new counsel, both of which were granted. Up until this point defendant had rejected representation by a public defender. Defendant agreed to representation by a public defender. On the morning of trial defendant filed a motion to represent himself, which the trial court denied. The trial court examined defendant on the basic rules of evidence and found he knew nothing about them and was not qualified to represent himself. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that under Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 10 an accused had the right to conduct his own defense. The court held that counsel may not have been forced upon defendant when he insisted he wanted to conduct his own defense as long as that election was made knowingly and intelligently.</SPAN></P>

The assignee of the contract commenced a replevin action against the buyer and requested an order of delivery. As a defense, the buyer stated in a conclusory fashion that the contract was usurious. During the hearing, the circuit court declined to allow the buyer's attorney to cross-examine the assignee's witness to show that the contract was tainted with usury that did not appear on the fact of the contract. The circuit court then returned a judgment for the assignee. The buyer filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in order to compel the circuit court to vacate the order of delivery and to grant her a full evidentiary hearing by permitting her to present evidence to support her affirmative defense of usury. The court denied the writ because the court held that such an extensive hearing was not so clearly mandated by Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-2119 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner had operated a junkyard on the site for 20 years, when the Commission filed an action requiring him to screen the junkyard from view. The landowner defaulted and the trial court issued a show cause order requiring the landowner to take action. The landowner filed an answer and a motion stating that he had moved the junkyard and seeking compensation. The trial court held that the motion constituted a suit against the state, which was prohibited. The landowner appealed, and the court reversed the trial court. The landowner's answer and motion did not constitute a counterclaim, any more than a similar pleading in an eminent domain action would have. Nothing in the record suggested that it could not and should not have been contemplated that the landowner was entitled to damages for complying with the mandatory injunction. The landowner's compliance with the trial court's show cause order was not a waiver of his right to compensation. In order to do equity between the parties, the court ordered the trial court to hear additional testimony on the subject in order to determine the amount of just compensation to the landowner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner was in the process of developing his land as a mobile home park when the city annexed the land and passed an ordinance rezoning the area, making the land's use as mobile home park non-conforming. The property owner's application for a permit for an electrical connection was rejected as an extension of a non-conforming use. The chancery court held that the extension of the use of the facilities beyond the first 12 lots would be an impermissible extension of a non-conforming use. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the right to utilize one's property for the conduct of a lawful business became &quot;vested&quot; when, prior to the enactment of such restrictions, the owner had in good faith substantially entered upon the performance of the series of acts necessary to the accomplishment of the end intended. Here, the court considered the steps taken by the property owner on the first 25 spaces prior to the passage of the ordinance to have been substantial and to have involved substantial investment to the extent that he was entitled to use them as a mobile home park as a non-conforming use under the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded &sect; 41-4113 was unconstitutional on face as violative of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The State had an interest in protecting certain areas of State government and sensitive positions of employment from those who might threaten the exercise of governmental functions. However, &sect; 41-4113(c), as written, indiscriminately and without any precision prevented, solely on the basis of association, any such party member from any employment by the State or its agencies. Because the injunction was based on &sect; 41-4113(c), it failed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment enjoining the university from paying the professor due to his political affiliation and found &sect; 41-4113(c) unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees were radiologists. Appellant brought an action against them for medical malpractice. The trial court sustained one appellee's demurrer to the complaint on the ground that the controlling statute of limitation, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 37-205 (1962), had run. The trial court also quashed a summons issued to the other defendant for service of process in another county. The wrongful death action survived. The court reversed in part and remanded. The court held that quashing of the original summons issued to another county was improper. Appellee could have been served with the summons because he worked there two days a week. There was an appropriate basis for appellant to believe that appellee could have been served in the other county within 20 days of the issuance of the summons, and he probably could have, had the sheriff not prematurely concluded that the summons should have been served in the county in which the action was brought. The trial court erred in ruling that the statute of limitations had run as to one appellee's vicarious liability for the acts of the other. The discovery rule did not apply to the medical malpractice action, which was barred.</SPAN></P>

There were no witnesses to the accident in which the administratrix's and the administrator's decedents were instantly killed. The administrator, in his answer, alleged the affirmative defenses of joint venture, assumed risk, and that the administratrix's decedent's contributory negligence equaled or exceeded that of the administrator's decedent. The trial court excluded the administrator's proffered evidence as to who drove the car, their activities, and the manner in which the car was driven preceding the accident. Judgment was entered on a jury verdict for the administratrix. The administrator appealed. The court held that the trial court erred in excluding the proffered evidence because it was relevant to the affirmative defenses of joint venture, assumption of risk, and the degree of contributory negligence by the administratrix's decedent. The proffered evidence tended to show that the administratrix's decedent was aware, as a joint participant, of the asserted dangerous and reckless driving that had occurred during the evening and made no protests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted under an act entitled &quot;An Act to Better Protect the Public Peace.&quot; Under &sect; 41-1412, the language must have been profane, violent, vulgar or abusive and it must have been directed toward or about any other person in his presence or hearing. When a police officer was involved, the statute applied to language used by a police officer as well as to the language spoken to a police officer. Before a person may have been properly charged with an offense under the statute, the profane, violent, vulgar or abusive language alleged to have been employed must have been such as in its common acceptation was calculated to have aroused the anger. In order to pass constitutional muster, it was not necessary for the statute to have set out the exact language employed by defendants.

The court denied the writ, holding that the trial court had the inherent authority to appoint a special prosecutor to aid and assist the grand jury under the circumstances presented. Ark. Stat. &sect; 24-108 provided for the appointment of a special prosecutor when there was an indictment, and Ark. Stat. &sect; 24-117 essentially provided for the appointment of a substitute if the prosecutor failed to attend court and carry out his duties. Neither statute required that the special prosecutor be from the judicial district to which he was appointed. The statute that conditioned the special prosecutor's pay upon obtaining a conviction did not void the statute, because even if it was unconstitutional, it was a severable portion of the statute.</SPAN></P>

Upon the investors' objection to the election of a substitute chancellor, a reelection was held, and the chancellor rendered judgment for the investors. The investors asserted that the reelection was also invalid, and that the chancellor was without jurisdiction. The court affirmed, holding that the chancellor had proper jurisdiction over the case because the regular judge was physically absent from the chancery court, and there was no evidence that the chancellor's election was unnecessary or improper. Because the investors' action was based primarily upon allegations of fraud, the chancery court had jurisdiction and did not lose it due to the fact that the Act gave similar jurisdiction to courts of law.</SPAN></P>

She was convicted as charged and fined $ 500.00. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that &sect; 41-2704 was not void for vagueness. Applied according to the proper standard for judging obscenity, &sect; 41-2704 did not offend constitutional safeguards against convictions based upon protected material, or fail to give adequate notice of what was prohibited. Since obscenity adjudication was limited to the standards announced by the United States Supreme Court as the final arbiter of obscenity law, defendant was certainly on notice that a decision from that court, which received wide publicity two weeks prior to the offense at issue was committed, defendant should have been placed on notice that the definition of obscenity would be in accordance with the standards set forth in that case. The language of &sect; 41-2704 made it clear that punishment was reserved for those who wilfully violated the statute, and it was sufficient that the statute was authoritatively interpreted to require the vital element of scienter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' counsel notified the prosecuting attorney that the cinema intended to exhibit a film. The staff of the prosecuting attorney and the police department were invited to an advance private showing and counsel agreed to release the film to the police after the showing, in order that a preliminary judicial determination as to obscenity could be made. A judge held that the film was obscene as the term was defined in Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-2730 (Supp. 1973). The cinema exhibited the film to paying audiences. On appeal, the court rejected defendants' arguments that: (1) &sect; 41-2730 was defective on its face because it did not limit the area of proscribed material to offensive depictions of sexual conduct, (2) the only standard provided by &sect; 41-2730 was whether or not the material appealed to a prurient interest, and (3) &sect; 41-2730 did not contain a provision that alleged obscene material could be redeemed because of any measure of social value. The court found that it was obvious that defendants were in no position to contend that they innocently exhibited the film to the public or that they were surprised by the application of the Miller standards to their prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor was arrested without a warrant on a misdemeanor drug possession charge. He was not taken before juvenile court and was instead charged with the offense in municipal court. The minor entered a plea of not guilty and filed a motion for the case to be transferred to the juvenile court. The minor argued that because he was arrested without a warrant, the jurisdiction of the juvenile court over him was exclusive until that court transferred the matter to another court. The motion was denied. The minor's petition for writ of prohibition was also denied. On appeal, the court ruled that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45-240 made it clear that the legislature did not grant exclusive authority in the juvenile court in matters relating the arrest of persons under 18 years of age without a warrant. If such was the case, there would be no need for the section providing an appeal from the decision of the referee to the county court. The court concluded that both the circuit court and the municipal court had authority to transfer a case to juvenile court for disposition.</SPAN></P>

He sought review of a judgment of the Clark Circuit Court, Second Division (Arkansas), which denied his motion to vacate his sentence under Ark. R. Crim. P. 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate, an indigent, remained in custody for over a year between the time he was arrested and when he was sentenced for the full 17-year term fixed by the jury. He asserted that the failure to give him credit for the time he spent in jail, without bond and awaiting trial, violated his constitutional rights. The trial court denied his motion to vacate his sentence without a hearing. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that in the absence of a statute providing otherwise, the allowance of credit for time an indigent was held in jail without bond pending trial was discretionary with the trial court. The court noted that had the inmate been held in confinement before trial solely because of his indigency, then he would have been entitled to the relief requested. The court determined, however, that the offense for which he was arrested was not a bailable offense until one year after his trial. Thus, at the time of trial, the official accusation by information of the prosecuting attorney was sufficient justification for holding the inmate in custody until his entitlement to bail was established, and there was no violation of his constitutional right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant acceptance corporation sought review of an order of the Boone Circuit Court(Arkansas), which held Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-501 (Repl. 1962) void insofar as it authorized a pre-judgment garnishment of accounts receivable without notice to appellees, a garnishee company and individuals. The corporation contended that certain United States Supreme Court precedent was limited to wages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation further argued that another United States Supreme Court case had little precedential value because it was a four to three decision with two Justices not participating. On appeal, the court held that it accepted the precedential value of the four to three decision because (1) other decisions of the United States Supreme Court extended the same due process principle of notice and a fair hearing to welfare rights and the suspension of a driver's license; (2) it was illogical to say that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required notice and an opportunity to be heard only when dealing with wages, welfare rights, and drivers licenses but not as to other deprivations of property; (3) Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-501 (Repl. 1962) was admittedly void as to wages and was not necessarily severable; and (4) 1973 Ark. Acts 144 provided a rather practical procedure for giving notice of a writ of replevin, and it was not impossible to make a similar provision with respect to garnishment proceedings. The court found that any contractual surrender by appellees of property without legal process was irrelevant where the corporation invoked the aid of the court.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the Commission rejected the fireman's claim that the rule violated his constitutional free speech rights and affirmed the ruling. The circuit court sustained the suspension, though it premised it on a finding that &sect; 16 was violated. The fireman challenged that ruling and the court reversed. It found that &sect; 16, which pertained to &quot;a matter&quot; that was undefined, was vague and indefinite and that it was not properly applied to personal complaints made to city directors concerning municipal legislation pertaining to firemen's pay or vacation rights. Even if the rule would be constitutional as applied to some other type of complaint, the court found that it could not constitutionally be applied to penalize the fireman for complaining about the ordinance and that the suspension imposed on him by reason of the claimed violation was improper and reversal was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant funeral home operator brought actions against appellee burial associations of two different towns, seeking to recover the face value of burial contracts issued by the two associations. Personal representatives of the two affected estates later joined appellant as parties plaintiff and were appellants. The trial court sustained defendants' demurrers but did not specifically dismiss either complaint. The trial court held that it did not have jurisdiction because appellants had allegedly failed to exhaust administrative remedies with the Arkansas Burial Association Board (board). The reviewing court, after determining that it had jurisdiction to review the appeal, agreed with appellants' argument that the trial court did, in fact, have jurisdiction. The court determined that the legislature did not intend to substitute the board for the courts in determining contractual liabilities, such as were asserted in the case on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court determined that the principal technical questions involved were questions of law, the determination of which was deemed by the court to be more appropriately addressed to the courts rather than to any administrative agency, and therefore the order declaring that the circuit court had no jurisdiction was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court first discussed the standing of the malpractice defendants to raise this issue and concluded that they could, in fact, question the authority of the out-of-state attorney to appear in the trial court. The court then discussed the inherent authority of Arkansas courts to regulate the practice of law and the relationship of that authority to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 25-108 et seq. The court found that the statute did not conflict with any rule of the court and was not unconstitutional under Ark. Const. amend. 28, Ark. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 3 or 18, or the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Accordingly, the court found that the trial court did not act in excess of its jurisdiction or proceed illegally when it granted permission for the out-of-state attorney to represent the malpractice plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the trial court to allow the appearance of an out-of-state attorney was affirmed and the requested writ of certiorari was denied.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that the opponents had the burden of demonstrating that the enabling legislation had no rational basis and that it was not reasonably related to the purposes of the legislation. The court found that the legislature, by its democratic process of conducting public hearings and the open discussions by its members in that forum, determined that the greatest income from the tourist dollar would be to the advantage of the members of the class. The opponents cited no authority to the contrary in the factual situation that the enabling legislation had a rational basis. The legislature could logically and practically envision that the opponents, as a classification, would be the beneficiary of a great or greater percentage of the tourist dollar. They also would benefit from much greater gross receipts and profits than the untaxed businesses which also derived a benefit from the tourist.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants committed sodomy in an automobile parked at a rest area adjacent to an interstate highway. The area was well lighted, and two sheriff's deputies observed defendants while patrolling in the area. Defendants were convicted of sodomy pursuant to &sect; 41-813. Defendants appealed. The court affirmed the convictions, finding that &sect; 41-813 was constitutional. The court reasoned that it was the legislature's responsibility to change the sodomy statutes if it felt that social changes rendered them unsuitable to society. The court found that &sect; 41-813 served a public interest, explaining that people who came to rest areas had a right to be unmolested, particularly by those in search of the exercise of their claimed right to sexual perversion. The court concluded that &sect; 41-813 was a legitimate exercise of the police power by the legislature to promote the public health, safety, morals, and welfare. Section 41-813 was not void for vagueness, and enforcement of &sect; 41-813 was not cruel and unusual punishment. The court also found no error in sustaining the state's objection to testimony of one defendant's fiancee or in the cross-examination of the other defendant.</SPAN></P>

When he attempted to make the arrest, defendant addressed him with various derogatory epithets. When asked to be quiet, she continued to repeat the epithets when another officer arrived. When the officer attempted to arrest her she resisted, striking the officer with a phone, which required another officer to assist. On appeal, defendant argued that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 41-1412 (1964) violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The court disagreed, noting that it had rejected the same argument in a very recent decision. However, the court acknowledged that the statute's prohibition was limited to &quot;fighting words.&quot; The court had no difficulty concluding that the words used by defendant qualified as &quot;fighting words.&quot; It was unnecessary for the words used to actually provoke a fight, as long as they were likely to cause a fight or retaliation. Defendant also argued that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain her conviction for resisting arrest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon a search of defendant incidental to his arrest, 1200 milligrams of heroin were seized. The act stated that possession by any person of a quantity of heroin in excess of 100 milligrams created a rebuttable presumption that the person possessed the heroin with an intent to deliver. Defendant contended that the act was unconstitutional under the United States Constitution. The court stated that the burden of showing unconstitutionality was on defendant and there was no burden on the state to make a showing of the constitutionality of this provision. The court held that every reasonable construction must have been resorted to in order to save the statute from unconstitutionality. The state conceded that the constitutionality of a statutorily created presumption rested in the rational connection between the proven fact and the presumed fact. The court concluded that it could not say that the connection here was not rational. The court held that in the absence of evidence contradictory of the legislative declaration, or showing it not to have been upon a rational basis, the court could not strike down the fact-finding stated in the act.</SPAN></P>

Defendants did not contest the sufficiency of the evidence, and one defendant admitted that if such epithets were directed at him, it would have made him angry. Defendants argued on appeal that &sect; 41-1412 was so vague and overbroad that it unconstitutionally infringed upon their right of free speech. However, the court upheld the statute on the basis that it was sufficiently narrow to address &quot;fighting words&quot; that were not constitutionally protected. The court explained that the constitutional right of free speech was not absolute, and that certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech were not subject to its protections. The resort to epithets or personal abuse was not in any proper sense communication safeguarded by the U.S. Constitution. The court held that &sect; 41-1412 was constitutional because it addressed only &quot;fighting words&quot; made to or about another person within his hearing in language commonly calculated to arouse that person's anger or to cause a breach of peace.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 3, &sect; 8 to change the dates of biennial elections, it was not authorized to implement Ark.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with arranging an abortion. He used an alibi defense. Defendant contended that Ark. Stat.

The court held that defendant did not have standing to attack the constitutionality of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-303 because defendant was not a physician and &sect; 41-303 was constitutional as applied to him. The court, however, reversed the conviction. The court held that defendant had the right to impeach the credibility of the State's witnesses on the grounds of their acts of moral turpitude.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant television company sought review of an order from the Pulaski Chancery Court (Arkansas), which found against the television company's contention that a tax instituted by Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 84-3101 et seq. (1960) was illegal in a suit involving appellee Commissioner of Revenues for the State of Arkansas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner levied a use tax on the use by the television company of video tape. The television company paid the tax under protest and thereafter instituted suit contending that the tax was illegal, and praying that it recover from the Commissioner the amount previously paid in, together with interest. The television company challenged a judgment for the Commissioner. The court held that the right to use property could not be separated from the property itself and the &quot;right&quot; spoken of by the television company would have had no value except for the use of the tape or film. No need existed to enact additional legislation because the use and sales tax complemented each other. The court agreed with the television company's argument that television broadcasting involved interstate commerce and that it might not be burdened by state privilege taxes for if the levy was directly on commerce. However, the court held that the rule was not applicable in the case. The tapes and films, upon reaching the station, had finally come to rest for the purpose for which they were sent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the lower court in favor of the Commissioner in a suit involving the television company was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
