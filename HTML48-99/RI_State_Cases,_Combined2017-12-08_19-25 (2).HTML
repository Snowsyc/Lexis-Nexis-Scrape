</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the estate's decedent had found plaintiff guilty of a motor vehicle offense, he imposed a fine on plaintiff. When plaintiff neither appealed his conviction nor paid the fine, the decedent committed him to an adult correctional institution. Plaintiff contended that his detention constituted false imprisonment because the decedent had refused to certify his constitutional question regarding the validity of 1956 R.I. Pub. Laws 3819 as required by R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 12-22-10 (1956). The court found that trial court properly granted the estate's motion for a directed verdict because plaintiff's detention under the circumstances as they existed at the time the decedent committed him was legally justified. Thus, plaintiff could not maintain an action for false imprisonment. The court concluded that plaintiff could not collaterally attack his conviction in a proceeding for false imprisonment. It also concluded that the decedent did not err in refusing to certify plaintiff's constitutional question because plaintiff had failed to raise his challenge to the statute with sufficient formality before the decedent.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners' appeal denied and dismissed, respondents' appeal sustained in part, decree appealed from reversed as to order Nos. 2 and 3, otherwise affirmed, and cause remanded to superior court for further proceedings.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents, a secretary and the members of a youth morality commission, appealed the decree of the Superior Court (Rhode Island), which in part granted the request of petitioners, a book store and some publishing companies, for a declaration that the actions of respondents were unconstitutional. Petitioners appealed the part of the trial court's decree, which held that H.R. 73, Gen. Assem., Jan. Sess. (R.I. 1959), as amended, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Resolution 73 provided for the formation of a Rhode Island Commission to Encourage Morality in Youth, which was, inter alia, to determine if the distributors' materials in the state were obscene, in order to protect the morality of the youth. Petitioners contended that such legislation and the production of a list of obscene materials was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. The court found, inter alia, that (1) obscenity was not protected by the guaranties of the First Amendment; (2) Resolution 73 did not by its terms nor by the Commission's acts under it prevent petitioners from exercising their First Amendment rights; (3) Resolution 73 did not confer on the Commission any official power to regulate or supervise the distribution of books or other publications, but rather empowered them to determine, which publications they believed were obscene; (4) the functions conferred were solely educative and investigative in aid of the legislative policy to prevent the dissemination of obscene literature; and (5) the mere fact that the Commission might recommend prosecution did not alter the fact that the Commission had no power to force petitioners or the distributors to do anything.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied petitioners' appeal but granted in part respondents' appeal. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment except for the decree that respondents' actions were unconstitutional and except for the issuance of the injunction to prohibit such action.</SPAN></P>

The defendant in each case filed pleas of general denial and immunity by virtue of provisions of G. L. 1956, &sect; 7-1-22. The plaintiff in each case demurred to the special plea of immunity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon motions for reargument in both cases, plaintiffs, a patient and her husband, sought review of the decisions of the Superior Court (Rhode Island), which denied plaintiffs' demurrers to defendant hospital's special pleas of immunity under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 7-1-22 (1956) in plaintiffs' actions of trespass on the case for negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">By reason of negligence or a lack of skill on the part of the hospital's agents and servants, the patient suffered a radiation ulcer in the left chest and the eventual amputation of her left arm at the shoulder. The patient and her husband contended that RI. Const. art. I, &sect; 5, was a prohibition against the legislative deprivation or abridgment of a vested right derived from the common law. They argued that the legislative attempt to grant immunity to the hospital where none had existed at common law was in derogation of the patient's rights at common law and was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. The court found that art. I, &sect;5, was a prohibition against the sale of justice and was in effect so construed, such that the provision did not undertake to preserve existing duties against legislative change made before a breach occurred. Although, in a free government, every person was entitled to an adequate legal remedy for every injury done to her, the form and extent of it was necessarily subject to the legislative power.</SPAN></P>

The detainee argued that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 12-7-1 (1956), which permitted detention without arrest, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The detainee and his companion had been drinking. Although both men indicated that the detainee was not driving when their vehicle struck two telephone poles, the investigating officer sent both men to a doctor for examination preparatory to a possible charge of operating under the influence of liquor. The detainee was placed in a jail cell at the police station because he appeared to have been drinking, was uncooperative, and refused to produce identification until he was asked to do so a third time. Within two hours, the detainee was charged with reveling. The court found that the detention of persons under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 12-7-1 (1956) in the course of investigating a crime was constitutional and that the statute's two-hour detention time was not unreasonable. Additionally, the court found that the police officers did not exceed the maximum two-hour detention period because the detainee's confinement beyond such period resulted from the reveling charges. The court overruled the detainee's exceptions, finding that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the police officers were justified in their actions in detaining and confining the detainee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trustees sought instruction as to the disposition of net income derived from the trust estate. Respondent beneficiaries contended that the settlor's adopted children and their issue were not entitled to any portion of the trust estate.

The court concluded that the settlor's intention regarding whether he meant to include adopted children within the limitations found in the in the deed of trust was not clear from a study of the deed of trust itself. Thus, the court applied the rule of construction prescribed in R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 15-7-16 to determine that it was the settlor's intent to include adopted children and their issue as beneficiaries, which rule promoted the public interest in perpetuating the family unit by integrating the status of adopted children with that of natural children.</SPAN></P>

The bill also prayed that state director of public works and chief of the state division of harbors and rivers be enjoined from further approving or authorizing the building of such structure and expending any public funds in connection therewith.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff relators appealed the decree of a trial court (Rhode Island), which dismissed their action to enjoin defendant oil refinery from building a pier in the east passage of Narragansett Bay and to enjoin defendants, the State Director of Public Works and the Chief of the State Division of Harbors and Rivers (agency heads), from further approving or authorizing the building and expending any public funds for the pier.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The relators, citizens and taxpayers, who originally brought the instant action in their own right but later substituted the attorney general, sought to restrain the refinery from interfering with or encroaching upon public rights to the public waters and lands adjacent to the refinery's property. The trial court dismissed the action, and the court affirmed. Three of the relators' arguments on appeal could not be considered because they had failed to set forth the allegedly erroneous rulings of the trial court in separate, specific reasons of appeal. The court then rejected the fourth argument that the trial court's decree was contrary to the law and evidence. As the sole riparian owner of the east shore, the refinery had a common-law right to wharf out into the bay to avail itself of the full advantage of navigation, provided that the exercise thereof did not interfere with navigation or the rights of other riparian owners. Further, the agency heads were assumed to have properly exercised their regulatory authority, and in the absence of their disapproval, the mere construction of the proposed pier was not unlawful and hence not a public nuisance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">With respect to plaintiff union's assumpsit action against defendant employer brought pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws ch. 28-8 (1956) to recover moneys allegedly owed to the employees by virtue of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, the union excepted to the decision of the superior court (Rhode Island), which dismissed the action for lack of capacity of the union to have brought the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer failed to pay its employees for certain vacation days and holidays after the union's contract expired. The union sued on behalf of the employees, contending that the parties had agreed to an oral extension of the contract. The superior court dismissed the action, stating that the employees were not properly before the superior court. The court held that R.I. Gen. Laws ch. 28-8 (1956) required the affirmative consent of each employee before the authority of the statute could have been invoked by the union. It was not the intention of the legislature to preclude the right of an individual employee to waive or ignore the violation of a contractual obligation to which only he and his employer were privy. The right of forbearance would have been lost to the employee if the union could have brought suit without an employee's consent. However, the superior court did overlook the rights of those employees who testified and those at the trial for whom it was stipulated that their testimony was corroborative. Therefore, the exception was sustained as to those employees, but overruled as to the remainder of the employees.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that an act predicated on an unconstitutional statute should not be deemed a nullity if it would work a hardship and impose a liability on a public officer. On grounds of public policy the court rejected the vendor's position that a police officer should be liable for damages in an action of trespass if a statute was later held to be unconstitutional, despite his good faith in making the arrest.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the issue was whether the trial justice erred in refusing to pass upon the constitutionality of said ordinance in so far as it applied to the property owner's property. It was clear to the court that under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-24-11 (1956), the property owner had no vested right to the classification in which his property was placed by the ordinance. It was also clear to the court that the property owner had an adequate administrative remedy that he had failed to exhaust. The issue of whether a complainant who had failed to pursue and exhaust his administrative remedies was entitled to equitable relief was one of first impression in the state. The court answered in the negative. The court found that the constitutionality of an ordinance would not have been considered until the administrative remedies provided by the ordinance had been exhausted. The property owner's appeal was denied and dismissed. The decree below was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The landowners wished to erect a gasoline filling station on their land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The land in question was unimproved. The property was partially on a hillside and in a general business zone. The landowners' property was not within an area that allowed automotive business uses under the zoning ordinance. The Zoning Board denied the landowners' application for a variance substantially on the grounds that petitioners had failed to prove unnecessary hardship and that a literal enforcement of the ordinance would deprive them of all beneficial use of their land. The court found that there was substantial evidence to the effect that the landowners could not have, without financial loss, used their land for any of the uses permitted under the ordinance. The Zoning Board abused its discretion in denying the application for a variance. The landowners were entitled to use their land for a filling station because it appeared that only by devoting the land to that use would they have been able to derive any benefit from the land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the landowners' petition and quashed the Zoning Board's decision.

The grand jury that indicted defendants was an appendage of the superior court for which it acted. The grand juries territorial jurisdiction was determined by the jurisdiction of the superior court, and where that jurisdiction covered more than one county, so did the jurisdiction of the grand jury. The jury that indicted defendants was properly drawn from both counties within the superior court's jurisdiction. The court also ruled that (1) the use of a stenographer to record grand jury proceedings was not unconstitutional; (2) the existence of technical irregularities in the way jurors were summoned for grand jury duty did not require the setting aside of defendants' indictment; (3) the nolle pros of one of defendants' co-conspirators did not constitute an improper amendment of the indictment; and (4) defendants' motion for new trial was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

The registry would then determine an amount of security that would be sufficient to satisfy any judgment or judgments for damages. A driver's license could be revoked if the driver did not deposit the security with the registry. The driver was involved in an accident and did not deposit the required security. The driver claimed that the act was unconstitutional because, inter alia, it denied his due process rights. The court found that the Act was not unconstitutional because it was a valid exercise of the state's police power. The purpose of the Act was to promote the welfare of the public by minimizing the hardship flowing from the financial irresponsibility of drivers who were involved in accidents.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Based on votes from voting machines and members of the armed forces stationed overseas, petitioner had 10 more votes than intervenor in his bid for office. However, after including civilian absentee and shut-in ballots, intervenor was declared the winner. Petitioner protested before the Board, arguing that the Board lacked authority to consider those absentee and shut-in ballots because they were unconstitutional. The Board denied his motion on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to consider constitutional issues. Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari, which the court granted. The court denied intervenor's motion to dismiss, holding that it had exclusive jurisdiction because it was confronted with a fundamental question of constitutional law raised on the record before the count was completed and raised in the petition. The petitioner had the right to challenge the Board's jurisdiction to count the questioned votes at any stage in the proceeding. The court held that there was effective legislation implementing R.I. Const. art. XXIII to the extent that the Board had authority to receive and count civilian absentee and shut-in ballots provided they were cast on election day.</SPAN></P>

The licensee challenged the authority of the board and the administrator to hear and determine such charges, claiming that a revocation without a prior criminal conviction was an improper delegation of judicial power. The court found that under R.I. Gen. Laws ch. 163, &sect; 10 (1938), as amended by 1948 R.I. Pub. Laws ch. 2124, a liquor license could be administratively revoked by the issuing authority on findings that the holder permitted violations of state law in the place where liquor was sold under the license.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After their land was rezoned, the property owners who were in the poultry business, obtained from the building inspector a permit to build an addition to the original part of their building. The town council received and duly recorded the report of the building inspector, including the granting of the building permit. When a zoning board was appointed later, it decided that it would never consider a variance in the zoning law to permit the raising and/or keeping of poultry on the property owner's lots. The court granted the petition for certiorari and reversed the board's decision. It held that the failure to organize a zoning board of review left the property owners without a proper forum, where their rights could be determined administratively. The board clearly exceeded its jurisdiction in attempting to enjoin the operation of the property owner's poultry business. There was no provision in the ordinance authorizing the board to exercise such jurisdiction. The board's action in rendering a conclusive and comprehensive decision thereon, although such a petition was not before them, clearly indicated an arbitrary prejudgment of the status and rights of the property owners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When respondents sought to condemn the landowner's property pursuant to a community redevelopment project as authorized by the Act, the landowner sought injunctive relief.

Laws ch. 2574, art. 8, &sect; 48(d), art. 12, &sect; 73 were not unconstitutional, finding that the agency acquired the land for public use in order to eliminate blighted areas in the interest of public safety and welfare; (2) therefore, &sect;&sect; 44, 49, 51, 84 of the Act were constitutional because they permitted the use of public funds for the project; (3) the requirement of R.I. Const., art. I, &sect; 2 that any tax have a fair impact did not preclude the agency from reselling the redeveloped property at a price lower than the cost of its acquisition; and (4) &sect;&sect; 48, 81 of the Act did not impermissibly delegate legislative powers to the agency, but that those sections detailed merely administrative functions and were guided by reasonably sufficient standards.

The public administrator and the telephone company argued that the telephone subscriber was not an aggrieved person within the meaning of 1949 Pub.

The court rejected the argument of the public administrator and the telephone company. The court found that the increasing of telephone rates, when applied to the telephone subscriber personally and to the facts which he alleged, imposed upon him an added financial burden or obligation, directly affected directly on his personal interests, and when reasonably considered from his point of view constituted a substantial grievance.</SPAN></P>

After trial and conviction in district court defendant appealed to the superior court and claimed a jury trial. On motion to quash the complaint the trial justice declined to rule because he deemed the constitutional questions raised by the motion to be of such doubt and importance that they should be certified to supreme court for determination pursuant to G.

The individual trustee was not a resident, and the corporate trustee was a New York corporation and had no place of business in Rhode Island. Under the provisions of R.I. Gen.

The trustees brought an action to recover the tax. The decision was in favor of the trustees. The court sustained the assessors' exceptions and reversed the decision as to the corporate trustee.

The city decided to close the highway to vehicular traffic and originally blocked the entrance to the station. After complainants filed their bill in equity, the city moved the barriers, but the access to the station was still severely limited. The lower court dismissed complainants' bill, and the court reversed and awarded complainants damages. The court found that as they were abutters, complainants were entitled to a property right in the whole street by way of an easement of right of way. The court determined that R.I. Gen. Laws ch. 333, &sect; 45 (1938) was intended to authorize cities and towns to close certain streets in order to promote an orderly flow of traffic, provided such closing would not result in depriving abutters on such streets of their property rights therein. The court concluded that &sect; 45 was invalid in so far as it attempted to authorize the closing of a street to all vehicular traffic without affording to abutters thereon compensation and due process of law before depriving them of their special property right in the highway. Complainants were entitled to damages.</SPAN></P>

The second question was whether the creation of redevelopment agencies with the power of eminent domain pursuant to the Act violated the Rhode Island Constitution. The court answered in the affirmative to the first question and in the negative to the second question. The court held that the Act was for a public use or purpose and, therefore, had not violated any fundamental principle of constitutional law because the act's objectives were legitimate for the exercise of the police power by the legislature.

Upon review, the court concluded that the ordinance was a constitutional delegation of the police power of the state to the municipality for the purpose and extent of the ordinance, which was to safeguard pedestrians from the danger of vehicular traffic. However, the court held that the commissioner's action was arbitrary and illegal because the ordinance vested in him only the power to reasonably regulate access to land, and not to effectively prohibit all access to property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff property owners contended that the amendment to the Middletown Sewer Enabling Act (Act) was unconstitutional pursuant to R.I. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 4, because the amendment related to the property, affairs, and government of the town and required approval by its electors. The amendment allowed defendant town to assess charges against sewer users in the town for its debt service or its capital costs with respect to the sewage system. Defendant contended that the amendment was enacted pursuant to R.I. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 5, which granted cities and towns the power to levy, assess, and collect taxes or borrow money with the permission of the general assembly. The court held that because the general assembly passed a bill that permitted defendant town to assess charges against plaintiffs in the town for its debt service or capital costs related to sewer system, the amendment to the Act was constitutional under &sect; 5 of the constitution. Furthermore, the court rejected plaintiffs' contention that the Home Rule Charter required local voter approval of legislation pertaining to taxation. Thus, plaintiffs' complaint for declaratory judgment and an injunction was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the general assembly properly enacted the amendment to the Middletown Sewer Enabling Act pursuant to article XIII, &sect; 5 of the Rhode Island constitution, a majority vote of the electors was unnecessary to permit defendant town to charge plaintiff property owners for debt service, construction costs, and capital improvements related to sewage system. Thus, plaintiffs' verified complaint for declaratory judgment and an injunction was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff apartment house owners sought an injunction from the court to stop the enforcement of Ordinance 6518 of the City of Woonsocket's Code of Ordinances, (the 1988 Ordinance) which would preclude plaintiff from asserting a 25 percent homestead tax exemption on plaintiffs' residential apartments that had 10 or more units. The court held that plaintiffs were not entitled to injunctive relief. The court held that the 1998 Ordinance and the legislative act authorizing it did not violate plaintiffs' rights under R.I. art. 1, &sect; 2, the right of all taxpayers to have taxation burdens fairly distributed and the guarantee of equal protection. The court held that plaintiffs would need to show more than the fact that the legislation picked a number, albeit arbitrary, to determine which units were subject to the exemption. The court held that plaintiffs had not sufficiently demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of succeeding on the merits of their claim at trial, and injunctive relief was denied.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge and the court denied the motion, finding that the ordinance was neither vague nor an unconstitutional regulation against defendant's use of the state's natural resources. The court determined that the ordinance under which defendant was charged clearly prohibited riding horses on the beach during the designated summer months, while it established guidelines for such riding during the remainder of the year. The court concluded that the ordinance was not a violation of R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 17, which secured to the people the right to use and enjoy the natural resources of the state. The provision did not prevent reasonable governmental regulation over state natural resources to secure their existence for the future and to protect the rights of others to also share in those natural resources. The court found the ordinance was a reasonable regulation designed to protect the use of the beaches by people during the busiest time of the year. The motion to dismiss was thus denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two of appellant doctor's patients filed complaints with the Rhode Island Board of Medical Licensure and Discipline (board) alleging sexual misconduct. While the board was investigating these complaints, another patient's wife filed a similar complaint. Following its investigation, the board concluded that appellant had engaged in sexual misconduct with two patients and had committed sexual assault upon the wife of a third. Consequently, appellant's license to practice medicine was revoked. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed. Under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-35-15(g), the court was precluded from substituting its judgment for that of the board with regard to credibility of witnesses or the weight of evidence concerning questions of fact. The court would only reverse the board's factual conclusions if they were totally devoid of competent evidentiary support in the record. However, questions of law were not binding upon the court and could be freely reviewed to determine what the law was and its applicability to the facts. Here, there was sufficient evidence to support the board's conclusions. Further, revocation of appellant's license was an appropriate sanction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, exotic dancing establishment, stockholders, and manager, filed an action seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions to preclude defendant town from enforcing Johnston, R.I., Ordinance 965, from interfering with the establishments liquor and other licenses, and from interfering with the live dancers and entertainment at the establishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The establishment held an entertainment license pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-22-5, a liquor license pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 3-7-7, and featured nude dancing as entertainment. The town council passed Ordinance 965, which prohibited nudity on a premises where alcoholic beverages were offered for sale. The city sought to enforce it against the establishment. Plaintiffs filed an action for injunctive relief and were granted a temporary restraining order. The parties then entered into a consent decree that was later vacated. After a hearing, the court granted injunctive relief. The doctrine of equitable estoppel was inapplicable because only the town council had the authority to grandfather the establishment from any adult entertainment provision. The court held that when Ordinance 965 was passed, the former R.I.G.L. &sect; 3-7-7.3 was still in force. Section 3-7-7.3 gave cities and towns who had not previously issued Class B licenses the ability to restrict entertainment in newly licensed facilities. Because the town had issued Class B licenses prior to 1993, &sect; 3-7-7.3 gave the town no power to restrict the entertainment at the establishment and Ordinance 965v was unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Before the court was defendant's motion to dismiss based upon an alleged invalidity or improper application of Rhode Island's violation statute, the court's unitary judicial violation statute, and the unconstitutional application of both. Defendant was found to be a Violator by the Rhode Island's Attorney General, who investigated defendant in his role as a male nurse at a nursing home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant allegedly rubbed the buttocks and breasts of a nursing home resident, without permission, while defendant was employed there as a male nurse. After the Attorney General found defendant to be a Violator, defendant's counsel waived the 10-day rule for the holding of a Violation hearing. Defendant, at the time of the incident, was on probation for a similar, second-degree sexual molestation charge. The prior charge resulted in a plea bargain. In response to defendant's motion, the court found no need for bifurcated hearing on the alleged violations and, therefore, denied defendant's motion. Specifically, no constitutional purpose would have been served by bifurcating the unitary judicial violation hearing because defendant had been afforded due process rights equal or superior to those required in a Scarpelli final hearing. Furthermore, the court recognized its obligation to honor the doctrine of stare decisis.</SPAN></P>

The apartment owners sought to permanently enjoin the tax assessor from implementing such exemption and argued that the legislature had unconstitutionally delegated its taxing authority by granting the tax assessor such exclusive authority. In entering judgment in favor of the apartment owners, the court held that the legislature had abused its taxing power by delegating taxing power to the city without any applicable standards to apply.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In actions consolidated for pretrial management, defendants, Roman Catholic bishops and others, filed motions to dismiss sexual molestation damages actions filed by plaintiff children. The bishops argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the religious liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment would be violated if the court exercised common law jurisdiction over their supervision and control of priests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The children alleged that they had been sexually molested by priests who worked under the assignment, supervision, and control of the bishops. The children filed damages actions, and the court consolidated them. The bishops filed motions to dismiss. The court granted the bishops' motions with respect to claims based on negligence, but it denied the motion with respect to claims based on the intentional failure to supervise and control. The court was required to exercise its common law jurisdiction to protect the interests of children within its jurisdiction. Recognizing the tort of intentional failure to supervise clergy did not offend the First Amendment. However, the court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate claims that the bishops negligently hired and retained the priests, because inquiry into these claims took the court into religious questions. Therefore, the court lacked jurisdiction to hear claims in ordinary negligence, premises liability, breach of fiduciary relations, misrepresentation by concealment, or breach of parental responsibility by one in loco parentis, so long as they were based on failure to exercise reasonable care to control the conduct of the priests.</SPAN></P>

However, the court denied the bishop's motion to dismiss with respect to claims based on intentional failure to supervise the priests to protect and prevent injury to children with whom priests may have contact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The town charged an access fee to a beach. The individuals argued that R.I. Const. art.

Additionally, they asserted that the manner by which the town established and structured the beach access fees also violated their equal protection and due process rights in that the fees were discriminatory. The court found that the individual's argument for the right to free access failed on the grounds of constitutional rights under art. I, &sect; 17, the public trust doctrine, dedication, prescription, and the law of custom. Further, the fee schedule in question did not discriminate against in-state and out-of-state citizens, and, as such, it was not discriminatory in a manner prohibited by the Commerce Clause. Additionally, the town properly established the access fee.

The access fee did not violate the citizens' constitutional rights to travel and was not a tax upon a fundamental right, as the citizens did not have a fundamental right to use the beach in question, and the fee was used to ameliorate the costs of preserving and maintaining the beach and the shore.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The purchaser sought to foreclose all rights of redemption of a tax title acquired when he bought an undivided parcel. The purchaser did not deny that the holders were entitled to redeem the premises under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-9-29, but the holders argued that the sale was invalid because only the life estate owner, to whom the tax had been assessed, had been notified of the pending tax sale. The court held that because R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 44-9-10, 44-9-11 did not provide for mail or personal notice to the holders, as parties in interest, other than the taxpayer, the tax sale was invalid as to them, and the exclusion of the holders from notice under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-9-11 rendered that section unconstitutional as to them. The court noted that the holders had a vested future interest in the real property, which was protected by Fourteenth Amendment due process requirements. Without reasonable notice the holders' property was taken without any process, let alone due process, with respect to them. However, because the life estate owner received notice of the tax sale, the collector could have constitutionally sold his interest, in whole or in part, at a tax sale.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the holders held their title subject to the purchaser's tax title to some or all of the life estate owner's life estate. Because the holders made a conditional offer to redeem the real estate, the court made no final judgment of foreclosure. The court then sua sponte stayed its decision pending further argument on the question of whether or not the validity of the sale and conveyance was controlled by a recent opinion.</SPAN></P>

The court held such a designation stigmatized him as it harmed his reputation and precluded him from employment in the child-care field. The court noted the DCYF had no procedural mechanism for notifying the son that his identity was to be included in a child abuse reporting system and would be disseminated to prospective employers. Nor did it have any procedure by which the son could object to being included in the reporting system. Thus, the process, which required proof by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, was unconstitutional and deprived the son of a constitutionally protected liberty interest. Since the day care provider's license was essential to the pursuit of her livelihood, a six-month delay in a post-deprivation hearing rendered that hearing meaningless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeal of the day care provider was sustained. The appeal of the son was sustained. The case was remanded for the limited purpose of reinstating the day care provider's license and for expunging all departmental findings that the son was the perpetrator of acts of child abuse, including sexual molestation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney general argued that the town council did not properly notify the public in advance that a certain meeting would be open and that a proposed social meeting with the tribe would be a topic, discussed the proposed meeting improperly in executive session, failed to add the proposed meeting to the agenda, and violated the Act's record-keeping requirements. The attorney general further argued that two council members improperly met with the tribe in a nonpublic forum. The court held in favor of the attorney general in part. The town council failed to properly advertise the meeting, failed to add items to the agenda at the meeting for public discussion, improperly closed and allowed matters to be discussed in a closed session, and failed to record and make available to the public proper minutes in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 42-46-3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The court enjoined the council from engaging in future violations of the Act and directed the council to review its procedures to ensure that future violations did not occur.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Tax Assessor assessed and valued certain computer equipment, and assessed a personal property tax against the lessor, as owner. The lessor paid the tax and was reimbursed by the lessee. Pursuant to G.L. 1956 (1995 Reenactment) &sect; 44-5-26 (Rhode Island), plaintiffs appealed to the Board of Assessment Review of the City. The Board denied the appeal. Plaintiffs filed an action in the court, challenging the assessment. Plaintiffs contended that although the lessor had title to the computer equipment, the equipment was nonetheless exempt from taxation, under R.I.G.L. &sect; 44-3-3(8) (Rhode Island), since it was, at all times, used exclusively for school purposes by the lessee, a nonprofit corporation. Defendants asserted that &sect; 44-3-3(8) clearly and unambiguously required both ownership and exclusive use; and that the exemption should also be denied because the lessor derived income or profits under the lease. The court entered a judgment and held that the computer equipment was taxable under Rhode Island law; therefore, plaintiffs' property had not been illegally assessed. Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of showing that the equipment was with the exemption statute.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff firefighters, retired for service-related disabilities, brought the suit under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 to contest the legality of Warwick, R.I., Code of Ordinances &sect; 7-75.2(b) as applied to them. Defendants, city treasurer and board of public safety, argued that the firefighters owed the city refunds for retirement benefits under &sect; 7-75.2(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Warwick, R.I., Code of Ordinances &sect; 7-75.2(b), passed before the firefighters had retired, provided that a retired firefighter's pension would be reduced for any amount that his actual earned income exceeded the salary paid to a firefighter of the same rank. Both firefighters had outside employment and, after their retirement, the city sought reimbursement from them for pension benefits that were paid beyond the limits of &sect; 7-75.2(b). The firefighters argued that the application of &sect; 7-75.2(b) violated the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution because they had a vested right to disability pension benefits before &sect; 7-75.2(b) was enacted, and its earnings limitation adversely impaired their vested rights. While the court agreed that the firefighters did have vested rights in their benefits, the court held that &sect; 7-75.2(b)'s limitation was not a substantial impairment of those rights because it could only reduce their pension benefits from 66 2/3 percent of their prior salaries down to 50 percent. The court held that &sect; 7-75.2(b) was also reasonable and necessary to serve the legitimate public purpose of preserving the pension fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the motion for summary judgment filed by the firefighters and granted the cross-motion for summary judgment filed by the city treasurer and board of public safety.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the petition for declaratory judgment and vacated the trial judge's order. A protective order was required to be narrowly tailored to serve the interests sought to be protected, be the only reasonable alternative, permit access to those parts of the record not deemed sensitive, and be accompanied by the trial justice's specific finding explaining the necessity for the order. The protective order issued by the trial judge did not protect the sealed portion of the Bill of Particulars. A portion of the order appeared incomplete. While the order clearly and quite properly permitted access to those parts of the Bill of Particulars not deemed sensitive, the order invited further explanation as to the necessity for the protective order, as well as a clearer indication of the compelling interest to be served by its issuance.</SPAN></P>

It applied the amounts it bid to the outstanding amounts owed to it on the mortgages secured by the real estate.

The court declared that the trust company was required by &sect; 7 of the Block Island Land Trust Enabling Act and G.L. &sect; 44-25-1 to pay the fees to the land trust based upon the amounts it bid for the real estate because the trust company purchased the real estate at the foreclosure sales.

Under &sect; 9-1-52, the second lowest bidder was entitled to damages as a result of not being awarded the contract when the low bidder violated the prevailing wage law. The low bidder moved for declaratory judgment, arguing that the section was unconstitutional because it did not further a legitimate state purpose and served no rational state interest. Holding that the statute was constitutional, the court denied the low bidder's motion to dismiss the action. Section 9-1-52 created a mechanism for enforcing the prevailing wage law. The payment of prevailing wages was a legitimate state goal. The court also found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute clearly informed the low bidder as to the possible consequences involved if it failed to pay the prevailing wage to its employees. The statute did not unconstitutionally impair the low bidder's contract. The low bidder's contractual relationship remained intact even though it might owe damages because of its failure to pay the prevailing wage.</SPAN></P>

As of June 30, 1995, the Fund claimed to have paid a total of $ 1,553,070.35 to claimants under the policy issued to the insured. Because the insured had a net worth of $ 50 million the year next preceding the insurer's insolvency, the Fund brought the instant action seeking reimbursement under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 27-34-11(2)(a) (1956). Section 27-34-11(2)(a) was triggered by circumstances occurring after the statute's effective date, including the insurer's insolvency and the Fund's payment of claims. The court's finding that &sect; 27-34-11(2)(a) did not operate retroactively eliminated the need to examine the statute's constitutionality. The statute did not impair the contract between the insured and the insurer. Even if substantial impairment did exist, however, it was clear the State had a significant and legitimate public purpose behind the regulation: preservation of the Fund's limited resources.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the Fund's motion for partial summary judgment as to the insured's constitutional defenses but denied the motion as to the non-constitutional defenses. The court also denied the Fund's motion for partial summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The mortgagors filed an action to permanently enjoin the mortgagee from foreclosing. The mortgagors then filed an application for a preliminary injunction order. A temporary restraining order was entered to prohibit the foreclosure pending consideration of the mortgagors' application for the preliminary injunction. The mortgagors contended that the mortgagee substantially breached its obligation under the loan agreement to advance funds as required by the mortgagors to finance the development of the real estate, and that this alleged substantial breach excused them from their obligation to repay the loan. After the hearing on the application, the court determined that the mortgagors were unlikely to prevail on their claim for a permanent injunction and for that reason held that the extraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction was not justified. Accordingly, the court denied the application for the preliminary injunction and vacated the temporary restraining order.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was no requirement that the hearing officer be bound by previous DEM decisions granting or denying applications to alter wetlands because each decision was fact based. The court stated that the action of the DEM was not an unconstitutional taking of the property because there was not a denial of all productive or economically viable use of the land nor had all reasonable or beneficial use of the property been rendered an impossibility. The court concluded that the landowners retained all of their fundamental rights on the property, and therefore, the economic impact of the governmental action was not astounding. The court determined that the landowners were not denied equal protection merely because similarly situated landowners were treated differently.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Based on the city's zoning ordinance relating to adult entertainment, the board revoked one owner's entertainment license and denied an entertainment license to the other owner for go-go dancing. The owners filed complaints challenging the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance. The cases were heard together, and the court denied and dismissed the complaints and vacated all prior restraining orders. Because the ordinance did not bar adult entertainment altogether, it was properly analyzed as a form of time, place, and manner regulation. The court found that the predominate intent of the city was unrelated to the suppression of free expression, but the provisions were plainly designed to reduce crime, encourage revitalization of a decaying downtown zone, maintain property values, and to preserve the quality of urban life. Based on the city's construction of the ordinance as not applying to performances at legitimate theatres, the ordinance was not overbroad in application. The ordinance did not violate equal protection guarantees on the ground that females, and not males, were forbidden from exposing their breasts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff applicant appealed from a decision of defendant Rhode Island Department of Human Services (DHS), which denied her application for benefits through the Pathways to Independence Program (Pathways). The applicant sought a declaration that the agency rule at issue was invalid as applied to certain persons with disabilities. Jurisdiction was pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 42-35-15 and 42-35-7 (1956 &amp; Reenact. 1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant received benefits through Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). The applicant requested that Pathways authorize supportive services relative to her attendance at a university. DHS denied the applicant's request because she was enrolled in fewer than 20 hours. The applicant claimed that she suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), which prevented her from taking more classes. The applicant argued that because of her disability she was entitled to the benefits even though she was taking fewer than 20 hours. The DHS appeals officer upheld the denial, and the applicant sought judicial review. The applicant alleged constitutional deprivation of her equal protection and due process rights, as well as violation of &sect; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 795 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 12101 et seq. The court held that the DHS regulation satisfied the rational basis test, that the hearing officer's conclusions of law were correct, and that each finding of fact was supported by substantial evidence. The court found no due process or equal protection violations and held that the applicant's rights were not prejudiced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court sustained the decision of the DHS. However, the DHS was directed to assist the applicant and provide her with counseling and guidance regarding her education and employment goals, and redirect her, if appropriate, to services that might enable her to reach those goals. The applicant's request for costs and fees was denied.</SPAN></P>

Section 93-12 regulated nude or seminude exhibitions unlawful where alcoholic beverages were offered for sale for consumption on premises. The court held that the ordinance was lawfully enacted because, under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 3-5-15, the state had delegated its alcohol regulation authority under the 21st Amendment to municipalities. The court found that the nude dancers' First Amendment and state constitutional rights were not offended because such entertainment was not banned altogether, but merely prohibited from occurring where alcohol was served. The court found no equal protection violation in the fact that only women, and not men, were prohibited from revealing their breasts and that &sect; 93-12 was not overbroad because it regulated both speech and conduct. Finally, the court held that the term &quot;buttocks&quot; as used in &sect; 93-12 was not unconstitutionally vague, but that the term &quot;cleavage,&quot; as used, was. The court struck the term &quot;cleavage&quot; from &sect; 93-12 and upheld the remainder of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A trial justice (Rhode Island) declared that partial summary judgment should enter in favor of plaintiff East Greenwich, R.I., school teachers, who had claimed that members of defendant East Greenwich school committee violated provisions of the Open Meetings Law by failing to give the prescribed notice regarding a meeting. The matter was before the court to determine if a sanction should be imposed upon the committee for the violation of the Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The committee voted to have the school district &quot;opt out&quot; of participation in the Early Retirement Act, which had been passed less than two weeks earlier and required local governments who wished to opt out to do so within 14 days. After finding that the committee violated the notice and advertising provisions of the Law, the trial justice left open the question of a sanction to be imposed for the violation. The committee argued that its violation was technical or de minimis, and that the violation occurred because of time constraints. The court did not agree, stating that it was obvious from the language of the Law that the legislature did not consider the notice and advertising rules to be technicalities. The court held that the committee not only failed to make a &quot;reasonably diligent effort&quot; to comply with the mandate of the Law but in fact made no effort at all. Holding that the only appropriate sanction to protect the interests of the public and the individuals directly affected the by committee's actions was to void the resolution, the court rejected the committee's contention that the teachers must have demonstrated that the committee acted in bad faith.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court, as a remedy for the violations of the Law, declared null and void the committee's resolution to &quot;opt out&quot; of the Act. The court also declared null and void all actions taken by the committee pursuant to the resolution. Because partial summary judgment was entered earlier in favor of the teachers, the teachers' counsel was to submit an amended judgment that incorporated the court's decision respecting the remedy.</SPAN></P>

Laws &sect; 46-22-4 levied a tonnage tax or licensing fee solely for the privilege of entering in and remaining upon Rhode Island waters, violating U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10, cl. 3 which forbid the laying of a &quot;duty of tonnage&quot; by any state without the express permission of Congress. The court found that the registration and licensing of documented vessels engaged in the fisheries and coasting trade were implicitly reserved to Congress. Since its very inception, Congress clearly and manifestly demonstrated an intent to preempt the area of documented commercial vessels, leaving no room for state action in the field. The state statute was in direct conflict with the regulations of Congress. The movement of vessels from state to state and back again was an activity included in the federal license and documentation. The court declared the statute unconstitutional as violative of the Commerce Clause. The imposition of a fee upon the vessel simply due to its presence in Rhode Island waters for more than 90 days was a tonnage tax and an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

The EMT also noticed an open bottle of beer on the front passenger side of the car. The EMT called for an ambulance and prepared to transfer defendant to one hospital where he was picked up by helicopter and flown to another hospital, where blood was drawn in preparation for surgery. Several tests were ordered including a toxicology screen for his blood alcohol level, which was routinely ordered so that the medical personnel could determine his mental status. No alcohol or alcohol swabs were used during this procedure. Defendant objected at trial to expert testimony interpreting that test and predicting what defendant's blood alcohol level was at the time of the accident. The court found that the State did not need to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of Rhode Island General Laws &sect; 31-27-3 because defendant was neither arrested nor charged with a violation of &sect; 31-27-2.6 at the time the blood test was performed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landlords were prosecuted by the city for renting apartments to groups of more than four unrelated individuals, in violation of the zoning ordinance. Under Narragansett, R.I., Zoning Ordinance &sect;&sect; 2.1, 5, 17.2 (Nov. 16, 1987), groups of four or more persons unrelated by marriage, adoption, or blood were not permitted to reside in designated areas. In the action brought by the tenants and landlords challenging the constitutionality of the consanguinity classification set forth in &sect; 17.2, the court concluded that the classification was invalid because it violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses contained in R.I. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2. The court noted that the classification improperly restricted fundamental substantive due process rights. Further, applying the strict scrutiny level of review under the Equal Protection Clause, the court ruled that there was no compelling state interest warranting the classification. Officials testified that there was no correlation between co-habitation by unrelated individuals and the goals of preventing crime, noise, disturbance, parking and traffic congestion, and controlling population density.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 2, the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The court held that plaintiffs had property interests in the approval of their subdivisions and were entitled to have their applications fairly considered. However, the court determined that they were not deprived of due process because (1) the referendum provided a reasonable bases for the planning board's action, (2) the zoning ordinance referendum was a legislative act that did not entitle plaintiffs to notice or an opportunity to be heard, and (3) plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies.

The court denied his motions and found that he lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 11-34-8 on the ground that it affected private property, such as the video store in question. He had no expectation of privacy in the store because he merely was a business invitee. In addition, he could not attack &sect; 11-34-8 for being vague, on the ground that it could reach into the marital bedroom, because the fact that his conduct fell within the statute's prohibitions precluded him from complaining about its vagueness as applied to others. Section 11-34-8 was not overbroad because it did not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct in that there was no constitutional guarantee of access to prostitution. The statute was gender neutral, despite the fact that the investigation centered on male homosexual contacts, and it did not violate his freedom of speech because his speech, which was part of his criminal conduct, was not constitutionally protected.</SPAN></P>

Laws &sect; 11-10-1&nbsp;unconstitutionally infringed upon his right to privacy, to the extent that it prohibited private, non-commercial, consensual sexual acts. He argued that, because the statute implicated the fundamental right to privacy, the State was required to demonstrate a compelling interest in proscribing the conduct to which it referred. The court rejected defendant's privacy argument. The decision of an unmarried adult to engage in consensual sexual activities was not of such a fundamental nature or was so implicit in the concept of ordered liberty to warrant its inclusion in the guarantee of personal privacy. Defendant also asserted that the discriminatory application of &sect; 11-10-1 to unmarried persons and not to married persons violated the Equal Protection Clause of the state and federal constitutions. The statute could not have been constitutionally applied to married persons because it would violate the right to privacy inherent in the marital relationship.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a rating organization, appealed from a decision of the Department of Business Regulation, Rhode Island, which declined to approve a rate premium increase request. The organization also sought against defendants, Director of the Department and the State Attorney General, a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and counsel fees, and claimed violation of its civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The organization contended that the Director's decision was arbitrary and capricious, exceeded his statutory authority, was part of a calculated scheme to deny its rate filing by intentional inaction, and was clearly erroneous. The court disagreed and affirmed the decision because the organization had misread and misinterpreted the decision. The court found that the Director, in denying the rate increase, had clearly touched all the required bases and complied with all of the standards set out in R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 27-7.1-7. Further, the organization had failed to sustain its burden of proving that the Director was biased against it. The court denied the organization's other claims because it had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Rhode Island 1992 Workers' Compensation Reform Act, 1992 R.I. Pub. Laws ch. 31, &sect; 30, which provided for a limited premium rate freeze and alternative cost recovery mechanisms for insurance carriers. The court declared the Act constitutional. The court concluded that the Director's denial of the rate increase did not deprive the organization of any constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the Department's decision and denied the organization's requests for injunctive relief and its claims for costs and attorneys' fees.</SPAN></P>

A division determined that the new system was not suitable as a repair and that the applicant had to meet the new construction criteria, but the applicant filed a variance application, which was denied. The court affirmed the decision. The court held that there was substantial evidence to support the Division's decision and that the trial court did not have to rely on the testimony of the applicant's witness regarding the effectiveness of the proposed system because he lacked first hand experience with the system. Additionally, the court held that the evidence supported the finding that a holding tank was a feasible alternative to the current system, and the law of non-conforming uses, as claimed by the applicant, did not apply to the case. The court held that the applicant's contention that the new system would be non-polluting was not supported by the evidence, and the law of nonconforming uses applied to zoning cases, but not to regulations established to protect the environment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowners challenged a decision of appellee Director of the Department of Environmental Management (Rhode Island), which held that the landowners violated R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 2-1-21 (1956) by altering a freshwater wetland without a permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Director issued a notice of violation to the landowners for violating &sect; 2-1-21. After two hearings, the Director ordered them to pay a penalty and to restore the wetland. The landowners argued that the imposition of a penalty absent a jury trial violated R.I. Const. art. 1, &sect; 15 and that the recording of a notice of violation in the land evidence records absent a hearing violated the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The court concluded that if the Director sought to impose an administrative penalty under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 2-1-21 (1956), the right to a jury trial attached to the civil-penalty action because the penalties would have been enforceable at common law by an action for debt and would have been triable to a jury. Due process did not require notice and opportunity to be heard before the filing of a notice of violation pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 2-1-24(a) (1956). The recording of a notice of violation did not deprive the landowners of a significant property interest. The recording did not create a lien but merely put prospective purchasers on notice that there was a suit pending involving alleged violations of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 2-1-21 (1956).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that the Director established by a preponderance of the evidence that the landowners had violated the statute. However, if the Director sought to enforce an administrative penalty, then the landowners were entitled to a jury trial. Recording of a notice of violation of the statute in the land evidence records did not violate the landowners' constitutional due process guarantees.</SPAN></P>

There were two rental units and a portion used by the property owners as their home. The Inspector found that this was not a permitted use in a W-I zoning district pursuant to the Westerly Zoning Regulations. The property owners appealed alleging that &sect; V(6)(a)(3) of the Westerly Zoning Regulations was unconstitutionally vague in that it did not define the term &quot;guest suite.&quot; The property owners also claimed that the Westerly Zoning Board of Review's reliance on the solicitor's definitions of guest suite and apartment constituted an invalid amendment to the zoning ordinance. The court reversed. While the court did not find the zoning ordinance unconstitutionally vague on its face, the board's reliance on the definitions constituted an invalid amendment to the zoning ordinance. Therefore, the Board acted in excess of the authority granted to the zoning board by statute or ordinance. In the absence of such reliance, the board failed to provide sufficient grounds for its decision.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, from a review of the record as a whole, (1) no substantial evidence was presented to show that the lots, as zoned, would cause the company unnecessary hardship to warrant issuance of the variances; (2) while the company was deprived of the most profitable use of the lots as zoned, it was not deprived of all beneficial uses; (3) consequently, the Board's decision was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, was not clearly erroneous, and was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion; (4) while there was ample evidence to support a variance from the parking and buffer regulations for the third lot, that variance depended on obtaining a variance for the other two lots; so, (5) the Board's decision regarding the two lots was proper, the failure to issue a variance for the third lot was moot, and the denial of that variance was correct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the size of the Board was increased the members' salary was reduced. After the two former members failed to win reappointment to the Board they filed actions against the Board and its members alleging that the salary adjustment was unlawful pursuant to R.I. Gen.

While the appeal of the case was pending, the two former members convinced the General Assembly to pass special legislation that authorized them to bring a lawsuit against the State for breach of contract. The Supreme Court sustained plaintiffs' appeal pro forma and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with the General Assembly's actions. On remand, the court determined that the special legislation that granted plaintiffs the right to seek recovery constituted a violation of equal protection in derogation of both the State and U.S. Constitutions.

He was later indicted on criminal charges related to these allegations and was convicted on charges of mail fraud. Defendants notified him that his pension benefits would be suspended. Defendants decided to conduct a hearing to determine whether he was properly entitled to receive state pension benefits given the allegations that led to federal and state indictments and his dismissal. The employee sought to enjoin defendants from conducting the hearing. The court denied the petition for an injunction. The Retirement Board, in administering and preserving the integrity of the retirement system, possessed the power and authority to conduct a hearing to determine the propriety of the employee's state pension benefits. His state pension benefits were subject to divestment if it was hereafter determined that he breached the implied requirement of honorable and faithful service.</SPAN></P>

The officials argued that the participants did not state claims under R. I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The participants claimed that certain legislative bills and administrative actions allowed favored individuals to buy retirement credit at less than full actuarial costs, so that the favored individuals bore a smaller share of the burden of the benefits of the retirement system than the participants did. The participants filed an action claiming that their rights were violated, and the officials filed a motion to dismiss some of the causes of action against them. The court granted the motion in part and denied it in part. The complaint failed to set forth minimal facts as to what the officials did or failed to do in their personal capacities that caused the participants' alleged deprivation under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Accordingly, the participants did not plead a cause of action under &sect; 1983. However, the participants stated a proper cause of action for violations of R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The officials were not absolutely immune from the participants' action, and the defense of qualified immunity was inapplicable until it was determined if the participants' clearly established rights were violated. The officials were not immune under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 36-8-3.1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The credit union was closed due to the failure of the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation and its own insolvency. The credit union's depositors could not access their accounts. The Director sought receivership. The credit union consented to receivership, anticipating acquisition by a bank. The proposed agreements stated that the acquiring bank would take all depositor accounts except for the depositor-directors' &quot;retained accounts.&quot; The receiver was going to retain these accounts. The court overruled the objections and approved the agreements. The depositor-directors objection, that the retained accounts provisions were a taking and pre-judgment attachment of their assets without due process, failed because R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 7-1.1-91(d), 19-15-2 allowed the receiver to retain the accounts. Further, the funds at issue were not the property of the depositor-directors as of their deposit in the retained accounts. It was proper that the depositor-directors' claims against the receiver depended on the outcome of the receiver's fiduciary duty claims because directors of insolvent institutions could receive higher scrutiny and different treatment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant imposed a restriction upon plaintiff's license, prohibiting her from dispensing controlled substances for one year.

The records of these transactions must have been kept for two years to meet the statutory requirements. The duties imposed upon plaintiff were clear, and &sect; 21-28-3.12 was not unconstitutionally vague or in violation of plaintiff's due process rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff contracted histoplasmosis as the result of painting a State-maintained lighthouse, which had accumulated large amounts of pigeon feces. Plaintiff brought a negligence action against the State under 1983 R.I. Acts &amp; Resolves 115, a special act authorizing plaintiff's action. Pending second trial on the action, the court granted the State's motion to amend its answer to add timeliness and unconstitutionality as affirmative defenses, finding that plaintiff failed to show extreme prejudice. At trial on the merits, a question before the court was whether the General Assembly's special act extending the statute of limitations and permitting plaintiff to recover damages in excess of the statutory limit was unconstitutional. The court concluded that the special act contravened the equal protection guarantees of the Rhode Island Constitution. There was no rational basis to support the act's discrimination in favor of plaintiff over all others who may have suffered personal injuries due to the State's negligence. In the absence of a rational basis or otherwise compelling circumstances, the act was also invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The first involved defendant's request for disclosure of instructions of law given to the grand jury that indicted him for negligently allowing a convicted felon to escape from custody in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-25-6 (1981 Reenactment). The second resulted from defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that he was not a &quot;jailer&quot; under the statute, and the felon did not escape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a police officer, had been assigned responsibility for maintaining &quot;custody&quot; of a convicted murderer who had been sentenced to prison, but was held under a special &quot;witness protection&quot; arrangement that allowed him to travel unsupervised on numerous occasions. Although the convicted murderer never failed to return to custody, a grand jury indicted defendant for negligently allowing a convicted felon to escape from custody in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-25-6 (1981 Reenactment). Claiming that the prosecutor may have erroneously instructed the grand jury on the interpretation of &sect; 11-25-6, defendant sought to compel disclosure of the grand jury minutes. The court granted the motion because the unique circumstances of the relevant custody arrangement, and the absence of a decisional history under the statute, created a possibility that the prosecutor gave the grand jury inappropriate interpretations that would require dismissal of the indictment. The court subsequently dismissed the indictment because there was no evidence the convicted murderer ever escaped or had the intent to escape, so defendant could not be guilty of negligently allowing him to escape.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The council was charged with protecting coastal resources under the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Plan (RICRMP) and the Rhode Island Salt Pond Region Special Area Management Plan.

The court denied and dismissed the appeal. The court held that the requirements of the RICRMP could not have been satisfied by any modification of the landowner's project because of the configuration of the land itself. The council was entitled to rely on its biologists' conclusions showing that no development of the land was possible under the goals and policies of the RICRMP. There was competent credible evidence both ways on the issue of whether the landowner's project would have created a significant risk of an adverse impact on the environmental, ecological, and scenic coastal values the council was charged to protect. Accordingly, the council's decision was supported by substantial evidence in the record, and it was neither clearly erroneous nor was it arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a hearing, the court found that the doctor had engaged in unprofessional conduct. The doctor argued that the Board violated her right to due process because the statute under which the Board affected her license, G.L. &sect; 5-37-5.1, was unconstitutional on the ground that it did not set a standard of proof. 1956 Rhode Island General Laws (1988 Reenactment) &sect; 42-35-10 provided that the rules of evidence as applied in civil cases in the Rhode Island Superior Courts applied to the hearing before the Board, and in civil cases, the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard applied. Thus, the standard applicable generally and in the case was the evidentiary-preponderance standard. The court found that the standard had been met. However, the doctor claimed that she had been denied a continuance. She had been granted two continuances to produce expert witness.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff parents brought an action on behalf of their son in the Rhode Island court challenging the constitutionality of a rule of defendant Rhode Island Interscholastic League, which forbade boys from participating in girls' field hockey.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The boy sought to play on the girls' field hockey team and was prevented from doing so by the League's rules. The boy brought an action seeking to enjoin the League from preventing his participation on the team and the lower court denied his motion for a preliminary injunction. The court reversed and held that the rule was unconstitutional and that the boy was entitled to try out and participate on the team and that the League could not prevent the team from playing in interscholastic competitions. The court found that the League was heavily involved with the state and received state funding, and therefore, its rule preventing boys from playing field hockey was state action. The court determined that R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 required strict scrutiny with respect to gender classifications. The court concluded that there was no compelling state interest presented justifying the classification based on gender. The court stated that while there was no general right to play field hockey, once it was made available as part of the League's programs, it must have been open to all. The court granted the boy's request for a permanent injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ordered that the League was enjoined from preventing the boy from participating in girls' field hockey and was prohibited from preventing the team from participating in interscholastic competitions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a city, filed an action against defendant, a city retirement board, in which it sought a declaration that the action taken by the board without prior city approval was invalid, and for injunctive relief to restrain the board from taking any future actio with respect to city employees and pensioners without first obtaining city approval. The court issued its findings and opinion in a memorandum opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At two duly constituted meetings, the city retirement board made several decisions that involved city employees and pensioners. The city, a home-rule municipality, contended that the board's actions were illegal because the board did not obtain prior approval from the city before taking the actions. The retirement board argued that it did not require prior city approval because it had plenary power to administer the city retirement system. In entering a judgment for the retirement board, the court held that the actions the retirement board took at its meetings were within the board's authority and were valid and binding upon the city because &sect; 908 of the Providence, Rhode Island Home Rule City Charter granted plenary authority regarding the city employee retirement system to the retirement board. The court found that pursuant to &sect; 908 the powers and duties of the retirement board were, without limitation, and to require the board to obtain prior approval from the city for its actions would be contrary to its without limitation powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court entered a judgment in favor of the city retirement board and against the city.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff applicant appealed a decision of defendant Rhode Island Board of Accountancy, which denied his application for certification as a certified public accountant (CPA) due to a lack of public accounting experiences. The applicant also requested his reasonable costs and attorneys' fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant had worked for a number of different employers applying various accounting skills and had passed the required examinations. The Board denied his application, citing his lack of two years' public accounting experience as required by R. I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-3-5(5) (1956). The applicant argued that his work experience had been sufficient to meet this requirement. The court noted that &sect; 5-3-5(5) did not provide a definition of &quot;public accounting experience.&quot; The court held that it was clear from the Public Accountancy Act of 1984, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-3-1 et seq., that the quality rather than the source of the applicant's public accounting experience should have been the focal point for the Board. Reversing the denial of the application, the court found that the applicant possessed the required ability and experience required for certification, and thus, that the Board's decision was clearly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on the whole record. However, the court rejected the applicant's challenge to the entire Act as unconstitutionally vague. The applicant was entitled to costs and attorneys' fees because the Board's position was not substantially justified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision and remanded the matter to the Board with instructions to certify the applicant as a CPA.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court held that the argument of equitable estoppel had to fail as the case did not involve the amendment of a zoning ordinance thereby rendering a permit illegal, nor did any exception apply, and laches by analogy simply had no basis on the facts of the case. The court also held that the board did not err in refusing to consider the resources expended by the owners and operators of the day care facility when determining whether they were entitled to a deviation because evidence of expenses in starting construction of building on their lot in violation of ordinance without first obtaining permission from zoning board was not evidence of undue hardship required to support a variance. The court further held that the record consisting of the lay testimony and statements of the attorney on behalf of the owners and operators of the day care facility had limited probative value in a proceeding for application of relief from zoning restriction and was insufficient to support their claim that they suffered an adverse impact amounting to more than a mere inconvenience.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the operator of a sanitary waste landfill and the owner of the land upon which the landfill sat, sought review of an order of appellee Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM), which denied their application for permission to continue and expand the operation of the landfill. The other appellees were the director of the DEM and the town in which the landfill was located.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landfill operator had been operating the landfill for approximately seven years under the authority of the DEM. The DEM concluded that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 23-18.9-9.1(b) constituted an absolute prohibition against the siting of sanitary waste landfills within the area in which the landfill was located. The court held: (1) that the order violated constitutional provisions because &sect; 23-18.9-9.1 upon which it purportedly was based was so vague as to constitute the denial of due process of law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV; (2) that the DEM's unforeseeable application of the statute constituted a denial of due process; (3) that the statute constituted a delegation of legislative power that violated R.I. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 1, 2; and (4) that the conduct of the hearing officer constituted a denial of due process because the hearing officer lacked the requisite degree of impartiality. The court found that appellants had been substantially prejudiced by the DEM's denial of the application. Moreover, the court held that denial could only be deemed arbitrary and capricious. As a result of the DEM's past conduct, the court held that the DEM was precluded from denying the application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff guardian ad litem in her action against defendant State of Rhode Island that alleged that the State's negligence caused injuries to an individual while he was in the State's custody. An amended judgment was entered and neither party appealed. The court confirmed the actions of the guardian ad litem in hiring an attorney. The State challenged the guardianship case and filed an interpleader action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The guardian ad litem filed a motion that sought a remand of the guardianship file for the purpose of filing post-judgment motions. The action was remanded and the guardian ad litem filed three motions: motion for payment, motion for deposit of funds, and motion for approval of partial disbursements. The court first noted that the issue of prejudgment and post-judgment interest on the judgment was properly before it and to have required the guardian ad litem to file a separate action would exalt form over substance. The court also decided that res judicata did not preclude consideration of the guardian ad litem's motions. Finally, the court determined that 1987 R.I. Priv. Acts 187 was not unconstitutional. The guardian ad litem was entitled to interest. Next, the court held that the State waived its argument regarding the deposit of funds into the court's registry. The State had filed an interpleader action and represented that it would have no objection to the transfer of any action from the probate court for decision on the distribution of proceeds. Finally, the court upheld the guardian ad litem's actions regarding the hiring of her attorney.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court entered an order that required the State to deposit money into the court's registry, required the State to pay prejudgment and post-judgment interest, and ordered partial disbursements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The anti-abortionists were engaged in conduct that included surrounding staff and patients as they entered and exited the center, verbally harassing staff and patients, and loud singing and shouting. Protesters shouted disturbing and ethnically-charged remarks. Some patients were so agitated that it interfered with their medical care, and other patients failed to show up for follow-up care due to the actions of the anti-abortionists. The women's medical center filed a petition for a permanent injunction. The court granted the injunction. The court held that while the women's medical center could not restrict the content of the speech, which would be a prior restraint, the women's medical center could lawfully request limitations on the manner in which the anti-abortionists engaged in protest. The court prohibited the anti-abortionists from trespassing onto the property, including areas of shared private possession, but not the public sidewalk. The court also created a zone around the center's entrance and prohibited the anti-abortionists from singing or shouting that involved two or more people in unison or having more than two people within five feet of a patient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The unauthorized practice of law committee brought a motion for injunctive relief against the State Department of Workers Compensation requesting the court to declare unconstitutional R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-94-5 (1984) and R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 28-33-1.1(9) (1979), as part of the Workers Compensation Act, R.I. Gen. Laws. &sect; 28-29-1 et seq. (1979). They prescribed the use of employee assistants to aid in claims preparation and other activities. The committee also sought to have the assistants restrained and enjoined from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. The court issued the injunction and declared the statutes unconstitutional because the statutory language such as &quot;providing advice and assistance&quot; and &quot;assisting at informal conferences&quot; were associated with attorneys representing clients in adversarial proceedings. In addition, the assistants admitted in assisting the employee in proving eligibility to receive workers compensation benefits, examining the workers compensation statute in order to it's applicability to each particular case, and attending pre-hearing meetings in the presence of a hearing officer in order to present the case of the employee seeking benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court declared those portions of the statutes that defined the duties of employee assistants unconstitutional and ordered the employee assistants be permanently restrained and enjoined from engaging in any activity that amounted to the practice of law unless they were first licensed by the Supreme Court of Rhode Island.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, an inmate, for himself and for a class of all others similarly situated, filed an action that sought declaratory and injunctive relief against respondents, the Rhode Island Parole Board and officers of the Department of Corrections for the State of Rhode Island.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the action was filed, the inmate was released, and the court granted leave for amendment that added three other inmates as class representatives. The action sought a declaration that certain parole standards established pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 13-8-14.1 (1956) were unconstitutional and unlawful, that the authority delegated to the Board was a unlawful delegation to the Board by the General Assembly, that the class was denied due process of law, and that the class members were immediately entitled to parole hearings. The court held that &sect; 13-8-14.1, as enacted by 1982 R.I. Pub. Laws ch. 375, and the standards promulgated thereunder could have been applied to applicants for parole who were serving sentences for offenses committed prior to the effective date of ch. 375 or any current standard in effect at the time of parole consideration without a violation of the ex post facto prohibitions of either the state or federal constitutions. The court declared that the inmates were entitled to a statement of reasons why any individualized factors in his or her case did not persuade the Board to grant him or her release prior to the time fixed in the applicable standards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court entered a judgment that declared that neither the statute establishing parole standards nor the Board's standards violated the ex post facto clause of the state or federal constitutions. The court also declared that the class members were entitled to a statement of reasons why the Board denied release and an opportunity for presentation of any changes to their individual factors after a denial of release.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employee appealed a decision and order of defendant, Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights, which found that the employee had not been discriminated against by defendant employer because of his age but had been retaliated against for engagement in protected activity. The employer appealed from a separate decision awarding the employee attorney's fees. The cases were consolidated upon appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was not selected for a promotion with the employer but was offered his choice of two other positions. While deciding on these positions, the employee filed a complaint with the State Equal Opportunity Office (EOO) alleging discrimination on the basis of handicap and age. When he informed his supervisor of his action, the supervisor said &quot;that means you stay where you are.&quot; Job postings were issued for the positions for which the employee was being considered but the employee was not chosen. The employee subsequently filed a charge with the Commissions alleging age and physical handicap discrimination as well as retaliation for filing a discrimination complaint with the EOO. While the matter was pending, the employee filed an action in federal district court based on the same occurrences. While the appeal of the Commission's ruling was pending, a jury verdict was entered in favor of the employer in the federal district court action. The court held that the doctrine of res judicata applied and that because the decision of the federal district court was last in time, its determination had rendered the Commission's determination in favor of the employee moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court entered judgment for the employer and denied and dismissed the employee's appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff registered voters, individually and on behalf of all persons registered to vote in Rhode Island, filed a declaratory judgment action against defendants, state officials and members of the Republic Party. The voters sought injunctive relief and declaration that the House and Senate Redistricting Statute,&nbsp;R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 22-1-1, 2 and 22-2-1, 2, violated provisions of both the Rhode Island and the U.S. Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The action was a consolidation of the actions filed by plaintiffs. The court considered the evidence presented and entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs because they proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt. The reapportionment plan overstepped political propriety and violated constitutional and statutory mandates. The plan crossed 33 municipality boundaries of which 22 were not necessary. The legislative structuring of the Senate districts violated the compactness requirement in that it was without a rational or legitimate basis, was not enacted in good faith, and was not free from the taint of arbitrariness or discrimination. The new Senate districts were not territorially compact, and violated the 19th Amendment to the Rhode Island Constitution. The court also found that the constituents of two black communities were moved into the new districts, which were not contiguous and diminished their political strength. This vote dilution constituted invidious discrimination and a denial of the equal protection of laws. Based on the foregoing, the court concluded that the redistricting statute was unconstitutional, invalid, and void.</SPAN></P>
