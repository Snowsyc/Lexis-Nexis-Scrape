Following the escheat order, numerous heirs appeared. The claimants traced their entitlement to the estate through the children of the decedent's aunt. The decedent's aunt never married and therefore the claimants claimed through the aunt's illegitimate children. The county argued that the statute in effect at the time the deceased passed away barred the claimants as the descendants of illegitimate heirs. The court concluded that: (1) the legislature in 1939 intended by the amendment to restate the probate act to provide for inheritance by representation by the illegitimate child and thereby intended merely to restate the law as it existed prior to 1939; (2) those claiming through illegitimate heirs should be allowed to inherit under the terms of the probate act enacted in 1939; and (3) the claimants were entitled to inherit through the first cousins of the decedent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants A and B sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Criminal Division (Illinois), which found them guilty, pursuant to a jury verdict, of two counts of burglary and one count of aggravated battery. Defendant A was sentenced to 30 to 60 years on each burglary, and 7 to 10 years for aggravated battery. Defendant B was sentenced to 7 to 15 years on each burglary, and 5 to 10 years for aggravated battery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants A and B participated equally in the commission of the burglaries, and their conduct only differed as to the aggravated battery, where defendant A beat the victim while defendant B stood in the doorway and watched. On appeal, defendant B contended the trial court committed reversible error in denying his motion for severance. The court agreed based upon the written confession of defendant A, which implicated defendant B. The court remanded the case against defendant B because the positive identification by a witness was believed by the jury and was sufficient to support a verdict of guilty. Defendant A did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as to the burglaries, but complained that the State failed to prove the charge of aggravated battery beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the evidence of the victim as to the beating administered by defendant A supported the conviction. The court found that the 30 to 60 year sentences imposed upon defendant A for the burglaries were excessive based upon the sentences imposed upon defendant B for the same crime (7 to 15 years). The court reduced defendant A's sentence accordingly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of conviction and remanded the case as to defendant B.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that he was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; that the prosecution prejudiced his case by introducing evidence of his prior criminal activities; that a mandatory life sentence under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, &sect; 22-40 (1965) was a denial of the equal protection of the laws, and that such a sentence was cruel and unusual punishment. The court ruled that the thorough police surveillance corroborated the informer's testimony and the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict. The court also ruled no motion was made by defendant to strike the testimony of his prior criminal activities, therefore his contention was waived. The court further ruled that if the State could have validly disregarded prior out-of-state misdemeanors while considering in-state misdemeanors it then followed that it could have validly disregarded completely the crimes committed in a sister state. Furthermore, the court ruled that possession of narcotics was an act and not a status or condition and its punishment was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 38, &sect;&sect; 28-1, 28-3 (1965), upon pleas of guilty. The circuit court ignored the recommendation of the State's attorney that no incarceration be imposed and sentenced defendant as a recidivist to a term of one to three years in prison. The circuit court denied defendant's motion for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, including a motion for leave to withdraw the guilty pleas and enter pleas of not guilty. On appeal, defendant primary contention was that the circuit court erred in not permitting him to withdraw his guilty pleas on the ground that they were made with the understanding that he would not be incarcerated. The court reversed, holding that defendant's pleas could not have been said to have been voluntary because it was obvious that defense counsel and defendant were led to believe that upon defendant's guilty pleas, there would be no incarceration. The case was remanded, with directions to vacate the pleas of guilty and the judgment and sentence pursuant thereto and allow the withdrawal of the guilty pleas and reinstatement of the not guilty pleas by defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested less than two blocks from a hotel where an alleged robbery took place. Police officers testified that they received a radio call concerning an armed robbery in progress. As they drove southbound in an alley about one and a half blocks from the scene of the crime they observed two men cross in front of the car. The officers, in a marked squad car, pulled alongside the men and told them to stop. Defendant stopped, and the other man ran away but was later captured. Defendant had a cocked revolver in his pocket. The jury convicted defendant, and he appealed. The court affirmed the judgment. The hotel guard had sufficient opportunity to see and identify defendant, and defendant was wearing a coat described by both witnesses when he was arrested. The prosecution properly submitted the certified copy of his previous conviction, and such evidence, although prejudicial, did not violate defendant's constitutional rights. No action or lack of action by defendant's counsel amounted to a lack of effective assistance of counsel. Defendant's arrest and subsequent search were based on probable cause that an offense occurred and that defendant was guilty of it.</SPAN></P>

The county had failed to either allege or prove affirmatively any facts which would indicate that it could controvert the matters set up in the verified petition for writ of mandamus or the motion for summary judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the temporary injunction order, which he was alleged to have violated and upon which his contempt conviction was based, was unconstitutional and that the trial court erred in refusing to allow collateral attack upon the temporary injunction order at defendant's trial for contempt. The court stated that the trial court issued a temporary injunction in an emergency situation pending the trial court's later decision, or that of a higher court, as to whether the trial court had the authority to grant the permanent injunctive relief prayed for. Defendant might not have taken it upon himself to deprive the trial court of this opportunity. To do so was to invite conviction for contempt of the trial court irrespective of whatever decision the trial court might subsequently reached on the merits of the complaint before it. In addition, the issue as to whether or not contempt had been committed was the only question properly before the trial court in the case. The court affirmed the judgment of contempt because the evidence upon which defendant was convicted of contempt was uncontroverted and was sufficient to warrant the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was issued three traffic tickets for driving with a revoked driver's license, for disobeying a stop sign, and for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating beverages. Defendant was brought before a magistrate for arraignment and filed a motion for a preliminary hearing. The trial court granted defendant's motion for a preliminary hearing. The State refused to participate. The trial court dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court held that the trial court dismissed the complaint in error. As a matter of first impression, the court determined that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 109-1(b)(3) required that a preliminary hearing be held only in those cases where the judge overseeing a defendant's initial hearing was without jurisdiction to try the offense. The court concluded that defendant was not entitled to a preliminary hearing because the judge overseeing defendant's initial hearing had jurisdiction to try the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer from the gambling unit obtained a search warrant for an auto parts store owned by defendant. The officer found several scratch sheets, three in the front of the store, one in the back and two in defendant's pocket. Defendant denied the scratch sheets were his and said he just picked them up and put them in his pocket. While the officer was on the premises, the telephone rang. Some of the callers ordered auto parts, but other callers placed bets on horses. Defendant denied having knowledge of the calls placing bets and ever accepting a bet. On appeal from his conviction, defendant contended that the complaint was insufficient. The court found that the complaint, as amended, was sufficient to apprise defendant of the charge against him and fully enabled him to prepare his defense. The court also determined that the evidence was clearly sufficient to show that defendant was engaged in wagering with other persons as charged. Finally, as to defendant's contention that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 28-1(a)(2) (1965) was unconstitutional, the court declined to review the issue, as it was not presented to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The husband argued that by admitting the will without the trust agreement he had been deprived of his statutory marital rights under the Probate Act. On appeal, the court affirmed the admittance of the will to probate without the trust agreement, holding that while a will could incorporate into itself some other paper which in itself was not a will, it was not necessary that the document be admitted in order to probate the will itself. The court held that the instant will had not incorporated the trust agreement in question by reference and, therefore, it was not required that the trust agreement be admitted with the will in order to probate the will.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first ordinance was an amended zoning ordinance that was declared unconstitutional because it constituted spot zoning. The second ordinance was an interim ordinance that prohibited the issuance of any building permits for three months. The developer purchased land to construct a condominium. At the time of the purchase, the land was zoned as a multiple-family use district. The ordinance was later amended, classifying the property under a two-family classification. The interim ordinance was enacted pending the resolution of the amended ordinance. The developer's application for a building permit was denied. The court found that by enacting the interim ordinance that prohibited the issuance of building permits, the village sought to suspend its valid zoning ordinance. The court affirmed the decision because the village's attempt to suspend the operation of its valid zoning ordinance, without compliance with the statutory requisites for amending its zoning ordinance, was null and void.

Count I of the complaint charged the lessee with negligence in the use and operation of an incinerator that caused the fire and resulting damage to the landlord's property. The tenant moved to dismiss this count based on an exculpatory lease provision. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted the tenant's motion, and the landlord sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord argued that the provisions of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 80, &sect; 15a (1963), which declared that exculpatory clauses exempting lessors from liability for damages resulting from the lessor's negligence were void and unenforceable, should be construed as applying equally to exculpatory clauses exempting lessees from liability. The landlord further argued that, in general, exculpatory clauses favoring lessees should be held void. The court rejected these arguments and affirmed the lower court's order. The court held that the language of &sect; 15a was unequivocal in applying only to lessors, and that the court could not read into it words that would make it apply to lessees. The court further held that such an interpretation would be contrary to the unambiguous language of the statute and to the obvious intention of the legislature. With respect to the landlord's other argument, the court held that the Illinois Supreme Court had recently rejected a similar argument, and that it was not within the court's authority to overrule the Illinois Supreme Court, or to modify its decisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for and convicted in a bench trial of the charge of abortion. Defendant appealed his conviction. On appeal, the court considered defendant's claim that the statute under which he was indicted and convicted, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 23-1 (1963), was so vague and indefinite that it failed to meet constitutional requirements of due process of law. The court found that the words used in the context of the statute were commonly understood and that an indictment based on the statute would be specific enough to enable defendant to prepare his defense. The court rejected defendant's claim that the indictment was unconstitutional and void because members of the Grand Jury that returned it were required to state a belief in God. The court found that defendant did not raise this issue at trial and thus could not assert it for the first time on appeal.

On appeal, the court found it well-settled that school districts established under enabling legislation were subject entirely to the will of the legislature, and could, even without notice, be contracted or expanded in area, or divided or united, in whole or in part with another district, or could be abolished.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case involved two separate and distinct cases in which the parties were five successor trustees of a charitable trust. Plaintiff three trustees brought a claim against defendant two trustees with respect to the administration of the trust. Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment to determine the powers of the trustees. The Circuit Court of Macon County (Illinois) denied compensation to defendants, and they appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased had created a charitable trust for the use and benefit of two colleges. It provided for five trustees to administer the trusts. All parties were trustees of the charitable trust. In the first case, plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment to determine the powers of the trustees with regard to majority vote versus a unanimous agreement or decision. Defendants contended that a unanimous decision was required. The second case involved compensation to defendants. Plaintiffs contended that defendants were not entitled to compensation because the trust did not provide for compensation. In the first case, defendants filed a motion to strike plaintiffs' complaint, which the lower court never ruled on. The lower court also denied compensation to defendants in the second case. On appeal, the court reversed the lower court and found that defendants were entitled to a hearing on their motion to strike and that they were entitled to compensation. The court determined that defendants were denied their day in court. The court found specific statutory authority that allowed defendants to receive compensation.</SPAN></P>

That section provided that a defendant in a criminal case could testify in his own behalf, but that a prior conviction could be shown for the purpose of affecting his credibility. The court refused to consider that argument raised for the first time on appeal. Defendant also contended that the jury should have been told that the evidence of his former conviction could be considered by them &quot;solely&quot; for impeachment purposes. Defendant offered an instruction which was refused by the court. That instruction was not clear in that it told the jury that the evidence should not be taken into consideration in their determination of whether defendant was or was not guilty of robbery, and that the only consideration which should be given to it was in determining what credit should be given to the testimony of defendant. The court held that the instruction was confusing, and the circuit court properly refused it. Finally, the court held that a prior conviction could be used, even if that conviction was pending on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the indictment did not state the address where the burglary and rape occurred; therefore, it failed to adequately state the offense. The court found it unnecessary to determine whether defendant sufficiently preserved the issue for review. The court held that the indictment was legally sufficient just by stating the county in which the crime occurred; no more specific address or location was necessary. Second, the common-law record of the trial court indicated that defendant was convicted and sentenced solely on the burglary count, whereas the trial transcripts show that defendant was convicted and sentenced on both offenses. The court held that this did not require a finding that defendant had been acquitted on the rape charge or that he could only be sentenced on the burglary. The court held that the common-law record was not controlling because the court could look to the entire record, but it did remand the record to the trial court to make the necessary correction. Finally, defendant's lack of appointed counsel between his arrest and his arraignment was not error because he was not interrogated and no evidence was obtained from him during that time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A patient went into the doctor's office. The doctor informed the patient that she was pregnant. The doctor then performed an abortion of the fetus. The patient was given pills and was sent home. The next day, the patient's legs became stiff and she experienced cramps. She attempted to see the doctor on several occasions, but he was not available. She then went to see a different doctor, who informed the patient that she was still pregnant. She had no additional money to pay the second doctor. Thus, she was unable to get an abortion. The patient eventually was diagnosed as suffering from a septic abortion. The court determined that the department's complaint against the doctor was sufficiently specific to inform him of the allegations of misconduct. The court found that the complaint properly verified that the complainant verified that the claims contained in the complaint were true. The court determined that the doctor was entitled to a bill of particulars but found that the failure to afford him such was not prejudicial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensed funeral directors filed a suit against the unlicensed director alleging that he was engaged in the practice of funeral directing, without a license. The suit against him also sought to state an action in quo warranto against the unlicensed director's employer. The unlicensed director charged that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, &sect;&sect; 73.1-73.10a and &sect;&sect; 73.21-73.30, relating to the licensure of funeral directors, were unconstitutional and void and that the law was the basis of the foregoing suit against the unlicensed director and of the owner's license revocation proceeding. The trial court dismissed the complaint for lack of standing and found the law constitutional. The unlicensed director appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that, when an unlicensed funeral director complained of apprentice and examination requirements, as well as other requirements of the licensing law without stating that he sought a license, the director had no standing to challenge the licensing law. The court noted that the trial court should not have ruled on the constitutionality of the law.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court rejected the contestant's argument that his motion to dismiss the proceeding to contest the election should have been allowed because the relevant statutes were unconstitutional. The court found that the contestant, having had a consideration of all precincts involved as a matter of right under the statutes complained of, was in no way injuriously affected by the statute and could not assert the unconstitutionality of the statute. The court stated that there was no evidence offered of any tampering with ballots, and there was no physical indication that tampering occurred. The court held that the tally of votes applied for, cast, counted, and observed was so close as to confirm the other testimony that the ballots were properly preserved. The court concluded that the count was so close to the canvass count except for the known changes based upon rulings on particular ballots as to be confirmatory of the testimony as to the preservation of the ballots.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The religious corporation established the not-for-profit corporation to hold title to its various assets.

The court found that because the religious corporation was part of a hierarchical church structure, it had to accept the mother organization's ecclesiastical determination regarding removal of the prior bishop. Nevertheless, the court reversed and remanded the causes because the dissolution of the diocese and creation of new ones exceeded the mother organization's powers.

The special assessment was never levied and, although the engineer provided the plans and specifications, the improvements were never started. The village asserted that the contract with the engineer violated Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 8-1-7 because no appropriation had been made prior to the contract to pay for the engineering services. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The provisions of para. 8-1-7 pertained only to payments that were to be made out of a municipality's general funds. Where services were to be paid for out of special funds to be generated in the future, no prior appropriation was necessary. The village abandoned the project when it failed to pursue litigation about the special assessments but this did not extinguish its obligation to the engineer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner sought a declaratory decree to enjoin the enforcement of a zoning ordinance as it applied to its property and to compel defendant city to issue the required permits and licenses for the construction of a gasoline station on the subject property. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) entered a decree in favor of the property owner. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner wanted to erect a gasoline station on its premises; however, because the parcel was zoned B3-3, that use was prohibited. The court reversed the decree that was rendered in favor of the property owner. The court stated that the existence of nonconforming uses could be assumed in any zone. That fact in itself could not invalidate the zoning ordinance. The evidence showed that the area in question was 96 percent in conformity with the zoning. The land was fully developed with B3 uses, and that fact constituted a rational basis for zoning the area B3. Additionally, the property owner purchased the property with full knowledge of the existing zoning. Further, the challenged zoning ordinance prohibited the erection of a gas station, which the court held was a legitimate legislative finding. The property owner failed to show that the restriction was arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious. Finally, the court held that the zoning ordinance was passed pursuant to the power conferred upon the city by the legislature and had a reasonable relation to the public health, safety, and welfare of the people.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff adjoining landowners appealed a decision by the Circuit Court of the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Lake County (Illinois), which granted the motion to dismiss by defendants, a county, landowners, and a builder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firs count alleges that the adjoining landowners' property would be substantially diminished in value by construction of the proposed cemetery on the premises across the road, without corresponding benefits to the public, and that the action of the county board of supervisors in authorizing the permit was, thus, arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable. In the second count, the adjoining landowners challenged the constitutionality of the entire special use procedure of the Lake County Zoning Ordinance. The court stated that because the determination of the validity of the ordinance was in part based upon the character of the neighborhood, the existing use of nearby property, the amount by which property values were decreased, the extent to which such decline in value promoted health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public, a balancing of the gain to the public as compared to the hardship imposed upon the property owners concerned, the suitability of the property for the purpose of a cemetery and many other relevant factors, none of which in itself was controlling, the court felt it would be improper to sustain a dismissal of the first count on the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the action of the trial court in allowing the motion to dismiss as to the second count but reversed as to the dismissal of the first count.

The court found the attorney and insurer guilty of contempt of court and fined each of them. The attorney and the insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney produced the insurance policy and the limits of said policy, but filed a response to the trial court's order in which he stated that the remainder of his file was in preparation for trial, and therefore privileged against disclosure. The attorney claimed that the order of the trial court violated Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 17 in that the documents and material directed to be produced were not sufficiently specified and that compliance with the order would violate Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 19-5(1) as requiring disclosure of memoranda, reports, or documents made by or for a party in preparation for trial. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court upheld the order for production, but exempted the statements requested because the description of the statements demanded lacked the specificity required in Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 17. The statement of the insured would not normally be discoverable. However, the insurer's relationship to the accident and to the parties was a dual relationship resulting from policies of insurance with each party. Under the limited circumstances, logic and fair play permitted and required the discovery of the insured's communication with the insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order to produce documents with the exception of the request for statements, which was not sufficiently specific.

Rev. Stat. ch. 46, para. 29-26 (1961) and sentencing him to penitentiary for a term of one to three years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After trial on a two-count indictment, the jury advised the circuit court that it was deadlocked. A defense request to poll the jury was ignored, a mistrial was declared, and the jury was excused. However, soon after, the foreman informed the circuit court that the deadlock only affected one of the two counts. The circuit court then reconvened, took the guilty verdict on the one count, and dismissed the jury. On appeal, defendant challenged his conviction on grounds including the irregular proceedings under which the verdict. The court reversed and remanded. It found that there was no basis for defense attacks on the State's proof of all elements of the offense, on the jury instructions, on the constitutionality of the statute itself (challenged under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments), or on the timing of the trial (challenged under the Four Term Act). However, the failure to poll the jury, combined with the fact that the jurors, believing they were discharged, were discussing the case with participants when the foreman advised the circuit court that a partial verdict had been reached, so undercut the integrity of the verdict that a new trial was required.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of burglary and he appealed. The court reversed and remanded. During trial, the State introduced evidence that defendant had needle marks on his arms. The court found that this was improper argument. First of all, the question of defendant's use of narcotics, if indeed he did use them, was not a proper issue in the trial. Secondly, counsel's remark regarding the needle marks was not based on the evidence. While there was evidence of needle marks, there was no evidence that these marks were the result of narcotic injections. It would be arguable that this remark of counsel was reversible error even had the objection been sustained, and there could be no doubt that the prejudicial effect of the remark was heightened by the refusal of the trial court to sustain the objection. The question was not whether narcotics addiction was a crime. The question was whether the suggestion in the evidence and in the argument of counsel that defendant was a user of narcotics was immaterial and inflammatory. The question had to be answered in the affirmative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cameras, lenses, and money were taken from an apartment. In affirming the judgment, the court held that defendant's guilt was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. He received a fair trial that was free from prejudicial error. There was substantial evidence to sustain the conviction, as the fingerprints and the fruits of the burglary were substantial evidence and were corroborated by the testimony of credible witnesses. There was no evidence of coercion or promise of leniency in the circumstances of the confession. The overwhelming weight of the evidence showed that defendant voluntarily confessed when police told him that fingerprints put him at the scene. Defendant's counsel was competent and prepared. The denial of a change of venue was correct. The motion came too late after the trial had begun. There was no error in admitting evidence obtained incident to an arrest. The police had reasonable cause to believe that defendant had committed the offense. Alleged errors were not prejudicial after the State's attorney asked defendant about prior convictions.

The adjacent owners razed the single-family house on their property and requested a permit to construct a 10-unit building. The city's department of buildings issued building permits to the adjacent owners and found that the plans complied with the Municipal Code of Chicago and the Chicago Zoning Ordinance. The owners filed a complaint alleging that the construction would violate the Code and Ordinance, that the owners would be irreparably harmed by the construction, and that their building would suffer a serious diminution in value. The matter was referred to a master who recommended that the cause be dismissed for want of equity. After a hearing, the trial court dismissed the decree. On appeal, the owners requested money damages because the construction was finished. The court found that the Code and Ordinance clearly expressed the intent of the city council and that the evidence established that the adjacent owners' building complied with them.

The Illinois Supreme Court transferred the case on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction of defendant's direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed that he had restrained and forcefully quieted victim while an accomplice raped her. There was contradictory evidence as to whether defendant raped the victim before the crime was interrupted. At the conclusion of a trial without a jury, the trial judge stated that defendant could be found guilty as a principal or an accessory. The court clerk recorded two convictions, rape and accessory after the fact to rape. Defendant's appellate brief asserted that he had been improperly convicted of two crimes when he had only been charged with one, rape. On appeal, the court held that it had appellate jurisdiction despite the fact that the case contained constitutional issues. The court had limited jurisdiction to hear and determine constitutional issues that were mixed with questions of statutory law. Defendant's challenge to the two convictions was without merit because the trial court had corrected the clerk's mistaken entry. The court rejected defendant's challenge to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 582 (1957), which punished an accessory as a principal. The evidence was adequate to sustain defendant's conviction as a principle for the crime of rape.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the village had the authority under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-8-4 (1963) to regulate and prevent the storage of combustibles. In addition, the village had the power to classify, regulate, and restrict the location of industries under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-13-1 (1963). The unconstitutional provisions of &sect; 5 did not invalidate the rest of the ordinance because the unconstitutional frontage consent provisions were severable.

The appellate court agreed, noting (1) that the trend and changing conditions in the neighborhood were toward high-rise apartment development and away from single-family uses, (2) that the property owners were injured by the substantial diminution in value of their property and the inability to economically develop the property by reason of the changes in the area and the zoning restriction, (3) that the suitability and desirability of the present use had diminished if not entirely disappeared, and (4) that the requested use of the property for R-7 high-rise apartment development was compatible with the character of the property in the area.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued an order, without notice or bond, which stayed reclassification, directed the issuance of the building permit, and denied a petition to intervene. On appeal, the court reversed the order of the trial court staying reclassification of the property, and affirmed the judgment in all other respects. The court held that where there had been a substantial change of position, expenditures or incurrence of obligations made in good faith by an innocent party under a building permit or in reliance upon the probability of its issuance such party had a vested property right and he could complete the construction and use of the premises for the purposes originally authorized irrespective of subsequent zoning or a change in zoning classification.

The owners filed a motion to withdraw their jury demand and the contractor objected to the withdrawal. The master allowed the motion, concluded a hearing, and made his report to the chancellor. The contractor contended that the master was without authority to hear the counterclaim and that he was denied the right to trial by jury. On appeal, the court affirmed the decree of the lower court, which dismissed the contractor's complaint and entered a judgment in favor of the owners on their counterclaim. The owners' counterclaim was within the class of cases to which there existed a right to trial by jury at the request of either of the parties.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property, which had been used for greenhouse purposes for over 40 years, was zoned by the city as R-2, or a single-family residential district, but the operation of nurseries and greenhouses had been permitted as &quot;special uses.&quot; The owners maintained that they had been deprived of their property without due process of law when they were denied a requested change in zoning to allow them to develop the area as an apartment complex. The city denied that the &quot;highest and best use&quot; of the property was as an R-6 classification, which was for multiple dwellings. A master to whom the matter was referred concluded that the zoning ordinance was void as to the owners' and purchasers' proposed project and the trial court adopted his findings. Reversing on appeal, the court held that the owners failed to carry their burden of demonstrating that the zoning ordinance was invalid. The major diminution in value went to the purchasers, who had no standing to attack the ordinance as they had signed the contract conditioned on a change in zoning.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his complaint, the minor alleged, inter alia, that at the time and place of the accident, the church was guilty of carelessly and negligently managing, maintaining, controlling, and operating its premises so that as a direct and proximate result he was injured. On appeal, the issue was whether or not the minor's amended complaint sufficiently alleged facts that stated a cause of action for negligence on the part of the church or a breach of the duty alleged. Upon review, the court held that the minor's complaint was sufficient to sustain a cause of action against the church. The minor was not required to allege compliance with the notice requirement of the Illinois School Tort Liability Act in his complaint. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 31, 33, stated that substantial averments of fact were necessary to state any cause of action and that pleadings were required to contain a plain and concise statement of the pleader's cause of action. The court found that the minor's complaint met the requirements of those sections, especially in view of the general purpose of the Act, and bearing in mind the Act's own derivative that it required liberal rather than strict construction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chiropractors argued that Rule 2.02 of Article II of the Rules and Regulations of the Illinois Public Aid Commission was arbitrary and discriminatory, and deprived the chiropractors of a property right other than by due process of law. The rule prohibited coverage for chiropractic treatment. The chiropractors sought an order restraining the Director from promulgating any rule that discriminated against persons licensed to treat human ailments without the use of drugs and operative surgery, and which would deprive the recipient of such services when the recipient desired the services. The court concluded that (1) it did not follow that because the Department of Public Aid provided recipients with medical services that anyone licensed under the Medical Practice Act could provide such services; (2) the Department did not unlawfully exercise the legislative power delegated to it by the statute; and (3) the rules were not capricious or arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

They contended that, because of the vagueness of the complaints, they would not be able to interpose a plea in bar in the event subsequently alleged violations, which arose out of the same transactions, were filed against them. In affirming defendants' convictions, the court held that defendants were fully informed of the exact offenses intended to be charged so that they knew what they were called upon to meet. The court observed that it was sufficient to state the offense charged in the language of the statute, where the statute adequately defined the offense. Where the statute creating the offense did not describe the act or acts which composed it, such acts must be specifically averred in the complaint. The court found that defendants' requests for a bill of particulars, for an admission of facts, and for a list of witnesses sufficiently apprised defendants of the conduct that violated the criminal code.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 99-56, an anti-noise ordinance, against their trucks. The distributors claimed that the ordinance was unreasonable and discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The distributors alleged that the ordinance did not adequately specify what was a noise that was &quot;distinctly and loudly audible upon a public way,&quot; that it could not be intelligently applied or reasonably enforced, and that sales of ice cream were reduced when the trucks could not play the company jingle. On review, the court found that the city was empowered to adopt such an ordinance as part of its police powers, that a reasonable construction of &sect; 99-56 meant that only distinctly and loudly audible noises were prohibited and not all noise, and that the court was to give a statute or ordinance its most reasonable construction in order to remove it from constitutional infirmity. The court noted that a very similar statute without the words &quot;distinctly and loudly audible&quot; had been deemed constitutional by the Supreme Court of Illinois. The court found that as a court of equity it could not enjoin the enforcement of an ordinance on a matter on which the city had the power to legislate, and that it was error to deny the dissolution of the injunction.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that it was not error to refuse to allow defendant to withdraw her guilty plea where she was not represented by counsel because, although the court agreed that both Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 730 (1961) and Ill. Sup. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessor had leases with an advertising company to display signs on the lessor's property. The county brought an action against the sign company, which shared the same address, officers, and directors as the advertising company, to have the signs removed. The sign company did not initially deny that it was the proper party, and the trial court ordered the removal of the signs. In response to a later show cause order, the sign company alleged that it was not the proper party to the action. The lessor filed a petition to intervene. The trial court denied the lessor's motion and ordered the sign company to comply with its order or risk sanctions. The court affirmed the rulings in part. The sign company's appeal of the trial court's denial of the petition to vacate was not timely, and an appeal on the threat of contempt was premature because no penalty had yet been issued. The lessor's petition for intervention was insufficient because it was not bound by the judgment against the sign company and no action had been brought against the advertising company.

The court recognized that important public questions were involved so the taxpayers and the mayor had the right to institute and maintain the action to challenge the constitutionality of the prevailing wage law. However, the court ruled that the validity of the prevailing wage law was not the issue on appeal, but the validity of the injunction was at issue. The court held that simply because appellees, by ignoring the provisions of the prevailing wage law, were able to construct public works with the expenditure of less money than they would if they had complied with the law, did not entitle them to the relief of the temporary writ.

The employee suffered no injury because of the hearing's original scheduling or by the rescheduling of it. He suffered no injury because the hearing was postponed without his consent. The court concluded that the rescheduling of the hearing date by the board did not cause it to lose jurisdiction. The employee's wife received two sealed envelopes containing notices of resetting. The court held that the service on the employee of notice of the rescheduled date was reasonable and proper under the circumstances.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff village sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of Cook County (Illinois), which entered judgment in favor of defendant county clerk in the village's action that sought a writ of mandamus to command the county clerk to extend the taxes as levied by a village ordinance against all property within the corporate limits of the village in accordance with state law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county clerk argued that because the village did not have corporate existence on January first he was not permitted by law to extend taxes for the village for the next year. The court agreed with the contention of the village that the taxing power was determinable as of the date of the tax levy. The court noted that the inconvenience of the county clerk was insignificant when compared to the loss of one year's tax revenue to the village. The assessment of property as of January first was merely the value placed upon the property at which the rate percent was applied to reach the amount of taxes required by local taxing authorities. The lien date had no bearing on the validity of taxes levied uniformly by all taxing bodies after January first. The court concluded that no one could tell on January first what his taxes would be for the coming year. No tax levied had been passed. Therefore, the power to tax was determined as of the date that the tax levy was made.</SPAN></P>

The complaint as amended alleged the same cause of action as in a previous suit and also alleged that it was brought pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para. 24(a) (1959).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Originally, a suit on the fidelity bonds was filed a court in another county. The original suit was dismissed, and two motions to vacate the dismissal were denied. An appellate court affirmed the dismissal. Certain language was amended to para. 24(a) prior to the filing of the corporation's subsequent suit. The corporation claimed that the amendment was applicable even though it was not in effect when the suit was dismissed. Without the language added by the amendment, para. 24(a) could not afford the corporation any relief. The fidelity bonds provided that any suit on the bonds had to be filed within 15 months after discovery of any fraudulent or dishonest act. The court concluded that the suit was not refiled in time. According to the language of para. 24(a), a suit could have been refiled within a year after judgment was given against a plaintiff. Paragraph 24(a) specifically referred to a judgment given against a plaintiff rather than an affirmance of a judgment against a plaintiff. The appeal taken by the corporation in the original action did not extend the time in which the new suit should have been filed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 72, to vacate an order rendering judgment against her and dismissing her third party complaint for want of prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seller was not present at the trial call. The buyers waived their jury demand and the cause was heard ex parte. The seller was given no notice of the buyers' waiver of a jury. The seller contended that &sect; 64(1) of the Civil Practice Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 64(1), required the buyers to give her notice of the jury waiver, and that the failure to do so was a mistake of fact that if known by the trial court would have prevented rendition of the judgment. The buyers argued, inter alia, that no notice need be given to a seemingly disinterested defendant who did not appear when the case was called for trial. The court found, inter alia, that issue having been joined by the filing of an answer after jury demand by the buyers, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 64(1) gave the seller the opportunity to demand a jury upon waiver by the buyers. Thus, the buyers could not effectively waive a jury trial without notice to the seller. The sellers' failure to give notice was a fact that would have prevented entry of the judgment had it been brought to the attention of the trial court and, therefore, was a proper basis for the petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city brought a chancery action in the Superior Court of Cook County (Illinois) against defendant resident building manager for an order compelling the manager to allow building department officials to inspect the building and determine if it conformed to the regulations of the city's municipal code. After the superior court issued an injunction restraining the manager from interfering with the inspection, he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manager claimed on appeal that the complaint was insufficient and that the injunction should not have been issued to enforce an ordinance that provided penalties for its violation. In considering his appeal, the court determined that the city had the right under Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code &sect; 39-9 to enter and examine the building. That same ordinance also made it unlawful for any person to interfere with the inspection. The court concluded that the fines provided as penalties would have been incidental to the actual relief that was needed, namely the inspection to ensure that the city fulfilled its duty to citizens to protect them from health and safety hazards. The court ruled that although courts of equity did not enjoin the commission of crimes, an exception was made with a possible menace to public health and safety or when criminal enforcement was incidental to the general relief sought. The purpose of the instant action was not to prevent a crime but was to prevent interference with the city's obligation to protect its citizens. The injunction, therefore, had been properly issued. The complaint was also properly made on information and belief pending the inspection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants attacked the constitutionality of the village's ordinance, but in making its decision, the criminal court found that the ordinance was constitutional. Defendants contended that because they raised a constitutional issue, the court had no jurisdiction and that the case had to be transferred to the state supreme court. In reversing the decision, the court held that the question was not fairly debatable under controlling case law and that it therefore had jurisdiction. The court found that the controlling case expressly decided against defendants' position on the claim of the invalid exercise of police power and that it also settled the question of religious discrimination. Defendant made no claim that he was a member of a religious group discriminated against by the ordinance, and thus he had no standing. The court held that the word &quot;sale&quot; in the ordinance was to have a broad meaning, which included activities reasonably and usually connected with selling and which could reasonably be said to entail &quot;disturbance of others in their religious worship.&quot; Finally, the court held that &quot;browsing&quot; was with the meaning of &quot;sale&quot; as used in the ordinance and was a violation of it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife filed an action seeking to declare a post-nuptial agreement between her and her deceased husband to be null and void. The grounds set out for relief were that there was a failure of consideration for the agreement and that it was procured by fraudulent means and methods. The circuit court allowed the executor's motion to dismiss the complaint. The question on appeal was whether the circuit court had jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of the post-nuptial agreement. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that jurisdiction to cancel or rescind an instrument on the ground of fraud was within the circuit court sitting in chancery and not the probate court, which lacked general equitable jurisdiction. Defendants argued that the action of the wife in filing her renunciation and petition for a widow's award placed the subject matter of the complaint under the jurisdiction of the probate court and that its jurisdiction was exclusive. However, none of the authorities cited by defendants supported such a proposition and did no more than emphasize the rule that probate courts did not have general equitable jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant village challenged judgments of the County Court of Lake County (Illinois) for appellee petitioners, certain electors and certain owners of land in the village, to disconnect certain territory from the village pursuant to the provisions of para. 7-39a (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 7-39a (1957)) of the Cities and Villages Act. The county court entered an order that the territory at issue be disconnected from the village.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to an order of the county court, the village held a special election on July 15, and on July 16 the county court entered an order finding that the majority were in favor, that the area and the inhabitants thereof were incorporated, and that an election for the village officers was to be held on August 1. The petitioners filed their petition for disconnection on July 31. On August 2, the county court entered an order declaring certain persons duly elected officers of the village. The question at issue was whether the village was &quot;organized&quot; as the July 15 election or only as of August 2 when the county court declared the officers elected. The county court found for the petitioners and ordered the disconnection. The court affirmed, analogizing from prior Illinois Supreme Court decisions that under para. 7-39a, the village became into legal existence on July 15 when the population voted to incorporate. It was in accordance with the letter and the spirit of para. 7-39a for the petitioners to file their petition as soon as possible in order to fix the village's boundaries as soon as possible. Thus, the petitioners' petition was not filed prematurely.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment and held that: (1) the grant of declaratory relief was within the discretion of the trial court, Ill. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A separate maintenance decree was entered, which found that the husband had wilfully deserted his wife and that the desertion continued without interruption for more than one year and that the wife was living separate and apart without her fault. Several years later the husband made honest and bona fide attempts to resume living with his wife. The wife spurned his offers to return. The husband was granted a divorce based on his claim that the wife was guilty of desertion because she had rejected his reconciliation offers. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that while the wife at one time had a duty to take back the husband if he made an offer in good faith, the wife's duty to accept the husband's offers did not stay open indefinitely. The separate maintenance decree alone gave the wife grounds for divorce because the desertion continued for more than a year after the decree. At that point, the wife had complete control over whether to accept the husband's reconciliation offers. Because the power of the trial court to grant a divorce was wholly statutory, the trial court had no power to approve the divorce on the ground urged by the husband.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the landlords' motion for summary judgment because of an exculpatory clause in the lease. The tenant appealed, contending that the language of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 80, &sect; 15(a) (1959), which was enacted after the trial court's judgment, made clear the intention of the Legislature that every exculpatory clause in pre-existing leases were void and wholly unenforceable. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 15(a) must have been given a prospective interpretation on the basis that a retroactive application would have violated the Fourteenth Amendment and Ill. Const. Art. 2, &sect; 2 because the landlords' defense of the exculpatory clause was a vested property right protected by the Due Process Clause. When &sect; 15(a) was passed, the landlords' right under the exculpatory clause had already vested, and the Legislature was without power to take that right away.</SPAN></P>

Almost 20 years later, the cemetery began to make plans to bury bodies on another portion of its property. The cemetery filed an action for an injunction to prohibit the village from interfering. The trial court denied the injunction. After more than ten years, the cemetery again filed an action for an injunction prohibiting the village from interfering with its use of the additional tract. The trial court granted the injunction. The village appealed. The court reversed and remanded.

Thereafter, the property owner prosecuted a direct appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court, which upheld the trial court. While that appeal was pending, the property owner filed another action, which remained dormant until the Supreme Court ruling. The property owner then filed a supplemental pleading that set forth the procedural history and purported to distinguish Ill. Rev.

The company's agent visited the job site daily, but the contractor was given complete charge and control of the premises. A rotten board on the scaffold where the contractor was working broke. He fell on a stake and pierced his shoulder, causing him great pain, lost work, and permanent injury. The contractor filed an action against the oil company under the Scaffold Act, Ill. Rev.

The court explained that the Act dealt with highly dangerous activities and fixed an independent nondelegable duty of compliance upon an owner of property, whether the owner retained a right of control or not. The jury could have found that the oil company's agent knew or should have known about the dangerous condition of the scaffolding at the time of the injury, making the company's violation both knowing and wilful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suit was originally brought by the employer to recover from the driver the amount of workmen's compensation benefits paid on behalf of its employee due to an accident allegedly caused by the driver's negligence. The employee was subsequently permitted to intervene as a party plaintiff and the complaint was amended to allege one count on behalf of the employer and one count on behalf of the employee. The trial court submitted two verdict forms to the jury for each count, over the objection of the driver. The driver maintained that there was only one cause of action and this argument persuaded the trial court to set aside the jury's verdicts and grant his motion for a new trial as to all issues. The court agreed with the conclusion that only one set of verdict forms should have been presented to the jury because there was only one cause of action and it rested in the employee. However, the court stated that it was clear that the jury had answered all issues in favor of plaintiffs. Thus, an entire retrial of all issues was not required. The order granting a new trial was reversed and the court remanded the case for a new trial only on the issue of damages.</SPAN></P>

The court found it was not necessary for the cause to be transferred to the Illinois Supreme Court for the purpose of determining the constitutional validity of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 34, &sect; 25.16 (1955) where the determination of the validity of the statute was not essential to a decision of the case. The court held the contracts were properly declared ultra vires where the contracts encompassed activities that were beyond the power of the county board. The court determined the county board did not have the authority to contract for the services of persons other than assessors or regularly appointed deputy assessors to assess property for taxation. The court concluded that statutes designated the officers for the discharge of the duty of assessment and provided for the compensation that they were to receive and that the county did not have the authority to enter into a contract with any other person to perform that duty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner filed an action for declaratory relief against defendant, a village zoning commissioner. The property owner sought a declaration that he had a right to build a single-family residence with a three-foot side yard in a zoning district that required five-foot side yards. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted summary declaratory relief for the property owner. The zoning commissioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner alternatively pleaded that the commissioner erred in denying its application for a permit to build the residence with a three-foot side yard, and it also raised a question as to the validity of the ordinance in its application to the property. In entering the summary declaratory judgment, the trial court based its judgment on its finding that under its interpretation of the terms of the existing ordinance the property owner had a right to erect the residence with a side yard of three feet. The commissioner argued that the property owner was not entitled to any relief because it failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. He contended that because the property owner only sought review of his decision, not the constitutionality of the ordinance, it should have appealed the decision pursuant to the Illinois Administrative Review Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 264 et seq. (1957). In reversing the judgment for the property owner, the court held that the decision of the building commissioner was a decision of an administrative agent, which was subject to review only under the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary declaratory judgment, which held that the property owner had a right to erect a single-family dwelling residence thereon with a three-foot side yard on each side of the residence, was reversed. The matter was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner operated a livery service in the city. He was arrested for operating the service without a license as provided in City of Decatur, Ill., Municipal Code ch. 70, &sect; 29. He pleaded guilty and paid a fine. The owner continued to operate the business. He claimed that he was in constant fear of being arrested and that his livery service was not a taxicab service. The court held that City of Decatur, Ill., Municipal Code ch. 70, &sect;&sect; 1 and 29 were valid and were not in conflict with the Illinois Motor Vehicle Law. The Motor Vehicle Law did not required a municipality to distinguish between taxicabs and liveries. Because the owner's vehicles were used for transporting passengers for hire and had no fixed rate or schedule, the vehicles came within City of Decatur, Ill., Municipal Code ch. 70, and he was required to have a license. The fact that the city adopted an ordinance applying to both taxicabs and liveries did not render the ordinance unreasonable. The City did not prohibit the operation of the owner's business but required only that he comply with the ordinance regulating the particular business in which he was engaged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon the jury being unable to reach a verdict, in the city's action against the corporation, the parties stipulated that the trial judge might decide the case upon the same evidence. The trial judge entered judgment for the corporation. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected the city's argument that the corporation failed to secure a license to operate or maintain a junk yard, in accordance with the ordinance, and that as a result the corporation was liable for the penalty of the ordinance. The court found that an examination of the record revealed that there was competent evidence before the trial court that the corporation engaged in the business of operating an industrial scrap yard, handling industrial scrap in carload lots or other large quantities, and processing and preparing it for foundry use. Therefore, the court concluded that the ordinance in controversy did not apply to the corporation. The court also found that the corporation had standing to raise the issue of the applicability of the ordinance to its operations, as well as the validity of the ordinance insofar as it might require the corporation to procure a license.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that an administrative decision was a decision that affected the legal rights, duties or privileges of the parties and that terminated the proceedings before the administrative agency. In this case, the court found that the zoning board had acted as a sort of legislative committee when it provided the property owners with a hearing as to their objections to the proposed rezoning. The court further found that the legislative act of the zoning board did not authorize a review by the property owners under the Administrative Review Act.</SPAN></P>

The commission commenced the action against the restaurant under the Illinois Liquor Control Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 43 (1955), and alleged that gambling was allowed on the restaurant's premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurant allegedly allowed gambling in a back room that was accessible though the hallway that led to the men's restroom. The restaurant argued that the revocation of its liquor license was unlawful because the restaurant did not lease the room where the gambling took place and merely shared a wall with the gambling area. On review, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the acts of an administrative body were presumed correct and that public officials were presumed to have properly performed the duties of their office. The court found that the agency's failure to adopt rules pursuant to statutory directions must have been established by the restaurant as a licensee and that it failed to do so. The court did not address the restaurant's contention that the regulation governing the revocation was unconstitutional. The court further held that the revocation of the liquor license was supported by sufficient evidence. While physical separation of the gambling and restaurant premises and legal separation bore on the issue of whether gambling was permitted to operate on the licensed premises, they were not determinative.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the procedure had been complied with, and that the waiting period had been properly waived. The court also held that it was proper to amend an action brought under the separate maintenance statute, changing it to an action for divorce.

The woman filed suit for breach of promise or agreement to marry, alleging that by reason of the man's breach of promise to marry her, she has been deprived of any and all financial benefits naturally to be expected from a marriage. The trial court entered judgment for the woman. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that seduction, pregnancy, and childbirth could be considered as elements of damage in an action for breach of promise to marry. The instruction did not correctly state the law. The Act, at Ill. Rev.

The railroad inspected the cars to see if they had any defects but only searched from the ground below and did not climb on the top of the car. The injured was harmed when he fell off a tank car while tightening the removable cover with the supplied dirty lug nuts. The court affirmed the trial court's decision granting judgment for the injured. The court determined that the railroad furnished the tank car to the employer and that the employer was not obliged to make an inspection of the car before his employees unloaded it. Although it was industry practice to only inspect the cars from below, the railroad did not properly inspect the tank car. An informal custom could not prevail over positive principals of law. The injured's method of performing his job did not constitute contributory negligence because the injured was following the protocol outlined by his employer. The injured was not precluded from recovery by his failure to demonstrate that his employer was free from negligence because the railroad and the employer owed the injured different duties.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Madison County (Illinois) granted the seller's motion to quash the service of summons on the grounds that it had not theretofore submitted to jurisdiction or transacted any business in Illinois, and, therefore, was not subject to the jurisdiction of Illinois courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seller was a Colorado corporation. The buyer alleged that the seller, through an agent personally present in Illinois, solicited and secured two purchase orders from the buyer selling him certain machines to be shipped from Colorado and that the machines were defective and subject to breakdowns, contrary to the written guaranty furnished by the seller. After being served with the buyer's breach of warranty lawsuit, the seller moved to quash for lack of personal jurisdiction. The trial court granted the seller's motion. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the allegations of the buyer's complaint, if proven, subjected the seller to jurisdiction in Illinois. The cumulative effect of the securing of the purchase orders and the location contracts by employees in Illinois, coupled with the seller's promise to send an employee to train the buyer, was the transaction of some business in Illinois. Not only was there an allegation of more than &quot;minimum contact&quot; with Illinois and one of its residents, but the cause of action arose out of and was directly connected with the seller's activities in Illinois.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tenant filed an action against landlord for injuries allegedly caused by the negligence of the landlord in maintaining the halls and stairways. Two years and seven months later, and after the jury selected and sworn, the landlord first asserted as an affirmative defense the existence of an exculpatory clause in the lease existing between the parties. Judgment for the defendant was entered in the trial court on the pleadings. On appeal, the court affirmed holding that the decision to permit amending the pleading was within the discretion of the trial court. The court stated that causes were not to be determined by the technicalities of procedure, but the court was to attempt to do substantial justice when all the facts were completely disclosed. The court determined that the exculpatory clause in the lease relieved the landlord of liability for the tenant's injuries. The court noted that the lease in this case was tendered with the exculpatory clause as a take-it-or-leave-it lease. The court found that the exculpatory clause was valid.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the putative father had no rights in the adoption proceeding and that the mother had not been subject to fraud or duress when she gave her consent. Affirming on appeal, the court held under an amendment to the Adoption Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 4, para. 3-7 (1955), a consent to adoption that was properly executed was irrevocable unless it was found to have been obtained by fraud or duress. The court determined that the trial court properly found that the mother and putative father failed to establish duress or fraud. Further, the court found that the putative father was not entitled to a hearing on the issue that he had not signed the consent for adoption notwithstanding his marriage to the child's mother before finalization of the adoption.</SPAN></P>

The township and neighbors also claimed the judge should have recused himself because he was related to the owner's attorneys.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner did not apply for a variation but brought a declaratory judgment action against the county to determine that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to its property and for injunctive relief. The township and the neighbors, who had not been notified, sought to intervene but their application was denied, as was their request that the trial judge recuse himself because he was related to the owner's counsel. The trial court granted the judgment to the owner and the township and the neighbors sought review. The court held that: (1) Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 34, paras. 152i-152o (1955), which authorized the adoption of the zoning ordinance, required public hearings and notice to property owners; (2) judicial relief was appropriate only after available administrative remedies had been exhausted; (3) the owner had an adequate remedy at law and the Administrative Review Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 265, &sect; 2 (1955), prohibited any other remedy; (4) the Declaratory Judgment statute was a general statute and yielded to a specific statute on the subject; and (5) the trial judge should have recused himself under ABA Canons of Judicial Ethics R. 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the declaratory judgment for the owner in its action against the county that challenged the application of the county's zoning ordinance to its property, and remanded the cause with directions to dismiss the complaint at the owner's' costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The probationer applied for a city patrolman position and was appointed a probationary patrolman.

The probationer obtained from the trial court a writ of mandamus commanding the Commission to withdraw its consent and directing defendants to give him a hearing. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that &sect; 10 (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24 1/2, para. 48 (1955)) of the Illinois Cities Civil Service Act provided for discharge by the head of a department in which a candidate was employed, with the city civil service commission's consent, upon assigning the reason therefor in writing to the commission. The court further held that the Act gave the police commissioner, with the Commission's consent, the sole discretion to determine whether the probationer was the proper person to discharge the duties of the office of patrolman and that granting the probationer a hearing would have circumvented the Act's purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a ruling of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) declaring that plaintiffs, who had been arrested but not convicted, were entitled to the return of all records of their identification as provided in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 780(e) (1953).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for declaratory judgment in substance alleged that the arrested persons had either been found not guilty or discharged from custody without any charge having been placed against him, and requested that fingerprints, photographs, and other records and memoranda of identification that were taken from them be returned. The complaint was based upon Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 780(e) (1953) and upon a general allegation of an invasion of the arrestee's right of privacy of the arrested persons. The court noted that the question involved was one of public policy, and that the legislature had not indicated what the public policy of Illinois should have been. Without a specific mandate of the legislature ordering the return to an arrested person of all records of identification held by sheriffs or police departments, the court was constrained to hold that such departments could retain in their files records of identification such as were here taken, for the purpose of a limited exhibition as was involved. There was no question that the conflicting rights of the individuals had in many cases be subordinated to the rights of the public as a whole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer filed an action to recover damages allegedly occasioned by the negligence of the driver in operating his truck, which resulted in the collision that killed its employee. The death of occurred some 20 months prior to the filing of the action. At that time the limitation on the filing of a suit to recover under the Wrongful Death Statute was one year from the date of the death of the decedent, as provided in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 70, para. 2 (1953), so the right to bring an action for wrongful death was barred by the statute. The employer claimed a subrogation right, but the court noted that the time within which the employer was permitted to exercise such rights was specified in &sect; 5B of the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1951, and that the employer had not filed its action until long after the expiration of such limitation. The court was of the opinion that the complaint, insofar as recovery was sought for compensation paid because of the employee's death, failed to state a cause of action. Since the amount of payment was not in dispute, the trial court's error in striking the affirmative defense could be cured by a remittitur in the amount of the compensation payment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, upon the driver's remittitur in the amount of compensation payments. If such remittitur was not filed within a specified time, the court directed that the case be reversed and remanded with directions to the trial court to enter judgment in the reduced sum.</SPAN></P>

Shortly after the amendment became effective, the board notified the coal company that it was going to deduct from the price of coal delivered the computed amount of the sales tax. In reversing a judgment in favor of the school board, dismissing the coal company's declaratory judgment action, the court held that the purchase price was a composite one, and that the board could not deduct the amount of the repealed tax from the agreed price. Inasmuch as the contract was made a part of the complaint and contained no reference to the tax, the board's contention that the tax was a part of the price was nothing more than its interpretation of the contract, and therefore a legal conclusion as distinguished from a well-pleaded fact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in favor of the board of education and remanded the cause with directions that an order be entered finding the issues in favor of the coal company and declaring the board of education to have wrongfully deducted the amount of the repealed tax from the contract price, and that judgment be entered in favor of plaintiff for that amount.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action for declaratory and injunctive relief, plaintiffs, a civil liberties union and a movie distributor, sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found that the distributor's film was &quot;obscene&quot; and upheld a decision by defendants, City of Chicago (Illinois) and Chicago's mayor and commissioner of police, who refused to issue the distributor a permit to screen his film.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Acting under the authority of Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code &sect;&sect; 155 -- 1 to 155 -- 7, defendants refused to issue the distributor a permit to exhibit his film. Plaintiffs filed an action in the circuit court, seeking a declaration that they had the right to exhibit the film. The circuit court found &sect;&sect; 155 -- 1 to 155 -- 7 unconstitutional and enjoined defendants from interfering with the distributor's exhibition rights. Finding the statute constitutional, an appellate court overturned the judgment and remanded to the circuit court with instructions to determine whether the film was &quot;obscene.&quot; Concluding that it was, the circuit court found in defendants' favor. Plaintiffs sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter to the circuit court with directions to order defendants to issue the permit. The court found that defendants had failed to present compelling and persuasive evidence that the film was obscene, noting that the circuit court's determination that the predominant effect of the film was to arouse sexual passion was the result of a misguided emphasis of an isolated carnal incident over the film's aesthetic and dramatic merit.</SPAN></P>

At the same time, the assignment judge entered another order continuing for hearing on appellants' oral motion for leave to file an amended complaint and for the administratrix to intervene. The court held that the assignment of the case for trial to one of the judges of that court did not involve any jurisdictional question as to the right and authority of the trial judge to grant a motion to amend the pleadings. The court held that the trial judge ultimately had the responsibility for a correct decision, either on the evidence before him, or on the pleadings, or both.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Director and the Superintendent of the Division of State Highway Police, Department of Public Safety, appealed an interlocutory order entered by Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which denied a motion to dissolve a temporary injunction, enjoining them from enforcing &sect; 121.02 of the Uniform Act Regulating Traffic on Highways, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 218b (1955). Plaintiffs were owners and operators of trucks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act in question was an amendatory act. Plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendants seeking a declaratory judgment that the Act was unconstitutional. Defendants contended that plaintiffs' complaint did not allege that the Act was effective as to plaintiffs and that the temporary injunction defeated status quo instead of maintaining it. After the trial court denied the motion, the court entered a stay order pending the appeal. In affirming the decision, the court held that plaintiffs' complaint was sufficient to sustain the trial court's order, finding that the fact that the Act did not affect plaintiffs until a later date did not impose any obstacle on the trial court in a declaratory judgment action. The Act was certain to take effect, and in the absence of a decision declaring its invalidity, it was to be presumed that defendants would enforce it. If such enforcement would substantially affect plaintiffs' property rights, they could seek a declaration before the legislation was effective. Finally, the temporary injunction maintained the status quo because it left plaintiffs in the position they were in at the time of granting the injunction so as to protect their rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted a temporary injunction, and the ex-officio county collector appealed. The court held that two per cent commission allowed to the town collector by statute was not compensation for services actually rendered.

The trial court had granted defendants' motion to dismiss based upon the fact that the action was barred by a two-year statute of limitations from the date of the accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of the accident, all of the parties were under the Workmen's Compensation Act (WCA). Plaintiff maintained that he had no cause of action until the court, in a prior decision, found unconstitutional &sect; 29 of the WCA, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 166 (1947). The court agreed that the two-year statute of limitations barred the action because the unconstitutional provision was null and void from the date of its enactment. Thus, &sect; 29 of the WCA conferred no rights, imposed no duties, and afforded no protection. Further, &sect; 23 of the Limitations Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para. 24 (1955), which stayed the commencement of an action because of a statutory prohibition, was inapplicable because the statutory prohibition of &sect; 29 of the WCA was not constitutional. Additionally, &sect; 25 of the WCA, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 138.25 (1953), had no application to bar the running of the statute of limitations because it was limited to an adjudication of unconstitutionality of a provision for compensation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, testatrix's sons and husband, sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted the motions, filed by defendants, trustee and executor, to dismiss the action in equity to establish a constructive trust for certain real and personal property. Plaintiffs also filed a motion to transfer their claim involving a freehold to the Illinois Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A testatrix's will made specific bequests to the parties and bequeath the remainder to the executor, who was also testatrix's son. Plaintiffs contended that the testatrix bequeathed the remainder of her estate to the executor for his and their benefit. A probate court judge stated that there was no obligation under the will to hold any assets in trust. Subsequently, plaintiffs filed an action seeking an equitable trust in the residue of the estate. The husband also filed a claim to establish a constructive trust for real property that he had transferred to the trustee. The trial court granted defendants' motions to dismiss. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the husband's claims, holding that his estate claim was barred by his election of his statutory share and the property trust claim was barred by the statute of frauds. However, the court reversed and remanded plaintiff sons' claim for a constructive trust in the estate, holding that the probate court did not have jurisdiction over trusts, and that receipts indicating they had received their share under the will did not bar their trust claim because it did not arise until after the close of the estate.</SPAN></P>

The employer and the insurer had no right to intervene, no right to subrogation, and no right to a lien on the judgments because the action was filed by the wife and daughter and was not &quot;brought by the employee or his personal representative.&quot; The wife and daughter's recovery did not belong to the employee or his estate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed his motion to quash the information on the grounds that the county court lacked jurisdiction over vagrancy cases under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 579 (1955). The county court sustained the motion on the theory that the statute placed a duty upon certain police officers to arrest a vagabond and bring him before a justice of the peace or police magistrate for examination, thereby limiting jurisdiction to deal with the offender to justices of the peace and the circuit court. In interpreting the statute, however, the court disagreed with the reasoning of the county court and reversed the order. The court specifically held that the statute did not confer exclusive jurisdiction upon justices of the peace in vagrancy cases. In addition, the court noted that the county courts had concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts and justices of the peace in all misdemeanor cases including the offense of vagrancy, because the county courts had original jurisdiction in misdemeanor cases under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 79, para. 165 (1955).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The note holders filed an action against two note makers to collect money due on a promissory note. A judgment was entered against the note makers and one note maker filed a motion to vacate the judgment on the ground that the purported warrant by the note holders' attorney upon which the judgment was confessed was void. The trial court denied the note maker's motion and he appealed. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the matter. The court first determined that it was not necessary that the note maker prove a meritorious defense to the note in support of his motion to vacate because the motion was based upon a lack of jurisdiction. The court determined that Cook County, Ill., Cir. Ct. R. 47, &sect; 3, was invalid in so far as it denied the right to vacate a judgment by confession for want of jurisdiction. Jurisdiction was acquired by entry of his appearance under authority given in the warrant of the note holders' attorney. The sworn statement by the note maker that the note attached to the complaint was a copy was uncontradicted. Thus, the warrant of the note holders' attorney was a nullity and could not give the court jurisdiction over the note maker.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the evidence presented questions of fact, upon which it was the province of the jury to pass.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff union members sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois), which sustained a motion by defendants, City of Rockford, Illinois, its chief of police, and police department, to dismiss the union members' petition for an injunction to restrain the chief of police from forwarding the union members' fingerprints and photographs to the Department of Justice in Washington, D. C.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union members were assembled in the vicinity of their employer company. There was a strike in progress against the company and on that day the chief of police arrested them all for violations of the city ordinance. All of them were placed in the jail. The chief of police fingerprinted and photographed each of the union members over their objections. The union members filed a petition for an injunction restraining the chief of police from forwarding the fingerprints and photographs to the Department of Justice. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the petition, which was granted. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the chief of police was within his rights in fingerprinting and photographing the union members after their arrests. At the time of the hearing on the complaint for injunction there had been no determination whether any or all of the union members were innocent or guilty, and until that was done the chief of police had a statutory right to retain in his possession the photographs and fingerprints. If a union member was subsequently found not guilty, then the photographs and fingerprints were to be returned to him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department denied the college's application on the ground that it had failed to comply with certain rules and standards of the department for approval as a medical college.

The court found that the college conducted a school for the teaching of all branches of medicine and maintained the same high standards as other medical colleges. The department was unjust, arbitrary and discriminatory to the college in the enforcement of the rules and violated the requirements of the Medical Practice Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91, &sect; 20 (1957). The court ruled that a college, which taught the practice of osteopathy, could upon the same standards and conditions as applied to other schools, teach its students the practice of medicine and surgery and have its graduates take the examination for the practice of medicine.</SPAN></P>

The firm and owner filed a counterclaim for damages against the corporation. The corporation contended that once one of the architects resigned from the firm, it was not longer possible for the construction plans which the corporation received to be used lawfully. The corporation contended that the firm was seeking to practice architecture through the services of the architect who resigned though an independent contractor agreement in a manner prohibited by the Act. The court reversed the circuit court's judgment for the corporation and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court construed &sect; 3 of the Act to mean that the supervision of planning and construction of buildings and structures as defined by the Act, should be under the overall supervision of a registered architect. The court found that both the president and the resigning architect were registered architects and thus, their employment agreement was valid under the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The temporary injunction was issued upon the sworn complaint, the unions' written motion to strike the complaint, the employer's motion for a temporary injunction, and the unions' affidavit in opposition to the motion. The employer's complaint alleged that the unions were not labor organizations within the meaning of the Taft-Hartley Act and the National Labor Relations Act, and that the unions were dominated by Communist leaders, who were members of the Communist party, which had its purpose to overthrow the government. On appeal, the court sought to determine whether the federal agency, which had assumed jurisdiction and had conducted a hearing upon the subject matter of the complaint, had jurisdiction to the exclusion of any state court exercising jurisdiction through the medium of injunction proceedings. Nothing appeared in the record to indicate that the National Labor Relations Board ceded to any agency of the state its jurisdiction, as provided in 29 U.S.C.S. Supp. IV &sect; 160. The Board had no authority to inquire as to the truth or the falsity of the non-Communist affidavits filed by the unions and their officers under &sect; 9 of the National Labor Relations Act of 1947.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the injunction, which restrained intimidation, force and violence.

The trial court denied their motion for leave to intervene. The supreme court transferred the cause to the court, which remanded the cause with directions to granted leave to the taxpayers to file the proposed intervening petition. The taxpayers were not fully represented by the school districts where their material interest was as taxpayers of a former district, liable for payment of a tax sufficient to retire the bonds, and in preventing any distribution of the bond proceeds to the school districts with a view toward relief from the tax levy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer filed its action under paragraph 1 of &sect; 29, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 166 (1949), of the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act). The tortfeasor argued that an employer who had paid compensation to his employee under the Act, which contained no provision for subrogation, was left without a remedy against a third-party tort-feasor, who was covered under the Act, and who had injured the employee. The tortfeasor based its argument on an Illinois Supreme Court decision, which was made after the filing of the instant lawsuit, and which declared that paragraph 1, &sect; 29 was unconstitutional. The joint judgment for the employer and the employee was affirmed. The court held that (1) after the accidental injury to the employee, he had a common-law cause of action against the tortfeasor for damages for his personal injuries, and (2) thereafter, his employer, under subrogation principles, was entitled to file a lawsuit in its own name against the tortfeasor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant customers challenged the decision of the Circuit Court of Rock Island County (Illinois), which granted appellee utility's prayer for a temporary injunction restraining them from enforcing a suspension order, interfering with the collection of higher rates, instituting proceedings to enforce the suspension order, and taking any steps to fine the utility based on its failure to charge rates set forth in a previous schedule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court reversed the order granting the temporary injunction. The court found that the circuit court did have jurisdiction to determine the proceedings and the chancellor had not erred in denying the customers' motion to transfer. The court also found that the fact that no formal order had been entered holding that the old rate adequate, the new rate excessive, or denying the utility's motion for temporary rates did not preclude the utility from instituting the proceeding. The court determined that the real issue was whether the rate which the utility was authorized to charge its customers produced a confiscation of the utility's property by allowing it an inadequate return. The court found nothing in the record to show any change in conditions from which it was justified in concluding that rates which were fair, just, reasonable, and non-confiscatory became confiscatory less than a year later, when the complaint was filed. The court concluded that it was unable to determine that the rates in the previous schedule were so plainly unreasonable that their enforcement resulted in confiscating the utility's electric properties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former fire marshal commenced an action against defendant Board of Fire and Police Commissioners of City of Peoria, Illinois, to review and reverse the Board's decision to demote the former fire marshal from his position to that of a hoseman on the ground that he was suffering from a heart ailment. The Circuit Court, Peoria County (Illinois) affirmed the Board's decision. The former fire marshal appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former fire marshal had been appointed as fire marshal under the rules and examination provided for by art. 14 of the Cities and Villages Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24 (1951). On appeal the former fire marshal contended that the Board did not have authority to remove him from his prior position. The court agreed and reversed the trial court's judgment affirming the Board's decision and remanded the cause. The court found that, under the Civil Service Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24 1/2, &sect; 39 et seq. (1951), in relation to cities, a civil service commission exercised a limited jurisdiction and had to find in the statute its warrant for any authority claimed. Because no provision was contained within the Act granting a local civil service commission power to reconsider an appointment or to demote for cause after the appointment was completed, such a commission had no power to demote employees under civil service who had been promoted if no fraud or mistake in certifications was shown. Thus, because no fraud or mistake was claimed in the advancement of the former fire marshal to his prior position, the Board was without authority to demote him.</SPAN></P>

The citizens claimed that they had a right to a referendum and sought an injunction pending final adjudication of the matter. The trial court dismissed the action for want of equity. On appeal, the court affirmed. In reaching its decision, the court noted that the ordinance was for the public peace, health, and safety and that it contained an emergency clause. The court held that the emergency clause was not a proper subject for a referendum and that the ordinance became effective without any opportunity for presentation to the electors for approval or disapproval by referendum. In addition, the court held that there was no showing that the city's action in the adoption of the ordinance was arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

He challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which upheld the validity of Village of River Forest, Ill., Ordinance &sect; 40(a) and (b), decreed that Village of River Forest, Ill., Ordinance &sect; 40(c) was invalid, and dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sold coin-operated music boxes to restaurant owners.

He claimed that the Village had no power to enact Village of River Forest, Ill., Ordinance &sect; 40. The trial court held that part of &sect; 40 was valid, and part of it was invalid. The trial court found that the invalid portion was separable for the valid portions and that the owner was not entitled to an injunction. The court held that Village of River Forest, Ill., Ordinance &sect; 40(a) and (b), were valid exercises of the village's police powers. They permitted it to either prohibit or license the use of the music boxes. Village of River Forest, Ill., Ordinance &sect; 40(c) was invalid.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimant appealed from orders of the Circuit Court of Macon County (Illinois) by which the trial court granted reserved motions for directed verdicts and for a new trial in the event of reversal, which were filed by defendants, driver and employer. The claimant contended that the trial court erred in entering a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and in denying his motion to strike the motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver struck the claimant's vehicle as the claimant was making a left turn. There was evidence that the driver was proceeding at a high rate of speed, that he never applied his brakes, and that he did not swerve to avoid the collision. At the close of the evidence, the driver and employer moved for directed verdicts. The trial court reserved ruling on the motions, submitted the case to the jury, and entered judgments notwithstanding the verdicts because the verdicts were in the claimant's favor. The trial court also granted the driver and employer's motion for a new trial in the event of reversal of the judgment. On appeal, the court held that the trial court improperly entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict because there was evidence that tended to prove that the driver had recklessly, wilfully, and wantonly driven his vehicle into the claimant's. The court held that because the trial court followed the procedure in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 192(3) (1951) in entering a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the driver and employer were not required to move for a new trial before entry of the judgment as required by Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bus owner asserted that the policeman's employer and its employees were working under and bound by the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act and that the policeman's injuries arouse out of and in the course of his employment and that his action was barred by &sect; 29 of the Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 166 (1949). The trial court decided that at the time of the accident the policeman was an employee and not an officer and that the provisions of the Act barred his action. The court noted that the Illinois Supreme Court had struck down the first paragraph of &sect; 29 as unconstitutional. Therefore, the court held that the policeman was an employee under the Act who was injured in the course of his employment by a third-party tortfeasor compulsorily bound by the Act, namely, the bus owner. The policeman had a right to maintain his common law action against the bus owner whether he and his employer became bound by the Act through election or compulsion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff driver appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Cook County, Illinois, which found in favor of defendant insurer in the driver's action to satisfy his judgment against a taxi owner and an operator for personal injury damage. The driver argued that the insurer was liable on its indemnity bond issued to the owner in compliance with Motor Vehicles Act, Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 95 1/2, para. 59, &sect; 42a(1) (1951).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's taxi was insured by the insurer's indemnity bond when the driver was in his car behind the owner's taxi, which was being operated by the operator. The operator backed the taxi into the driver's bumper, jumped out of the taxi, and shouted at the driver. The driver was assaulted, and he lost an eye and sustained other injuries. The driver recovered judgment against the owner and the operator, and he sought to satisfy the judgment by a garnishment against the insurer. The insurer asserted that the operator's actions were wilful and not negligent and that they took place while he was outside of the taxi. The trial court found in favor of the insurer, and the driver appealed. The court reversed, holding that the jury's findings conclusively determined that the driver's injuries resulted from the wilful &quot;negligent&quot; acts of the operator, acting as the owner's agent in operating the taxi. Under the circumstances, the term &quot;operation&quot; as used in the bond was construed to include injuries outside of the taxi by assault.

Plaintiffs sought to enjoin any sale of the hotel, except under court supervision, and to liquidate the hotel under &sect; 86 of the Illinois Business Corporation Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants controlled at least two-thirds of the voting stock and thus were able to approve the sale in a shareholders' meeting. Plaintiffs alleged that the sale through the exercise of such control was presumptively fraudulent and that the grossly inadequate purchase price established actual fraud. The only questions remaining on the appeal were the sufficiency of the pleadings and plaintiffs' legal capacity to sue. Taking the allegations as true, the court found that the sale price was indeed grossly inadequate, and there had been no advertising for competitive bids. Defendants were alleged to have been active participants in a conspiracy to defraud the hotel's other shareholders, as the sale was in reality a sale to and for the benefit of defendants and not to a stranger, and defendants had prevented plaintiffs from communicating with the other shareholders who might also protest. The court reversed, concluding that a cause of action existing at the time suit was started had been properly stated in plaintiffs' pleadings. Matters arising after that time had been properly alleged in the supplemental pleadings and adequately stated grounds for relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's finding that plaintiffs' pleadings were inadequate and remanded with directions to overrule defendants' motion to strike.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company contracted to sell its property to a railroad company. The sale was conditioned upon good title being shown, without zoning restrictions against its use as a railway freight terminal. Thereafter, the municipality's council amended a zoning ordinance, classifying the property for apartment-house usage, thus blocking the sale by the company to the railroad company. The company then filed a complaint against the municipality, alleging the invalidity of the ordinance and praying for an injunction against interference with the use of the land as permitted prior to the amendment. The trial court entered a decree in favor of the company. The Illinois Supreme Court transferred the municipality's appeal to the appellate court. The court found that the environmental factors of the area where the property was located were not desirable for residential living. The factors included the noise of the railroads, the smell of the stockyards, dust and smoke from adjacent factories, and the congestion of the streets. The court also found no evidence that there was funding for the building of a housing project. Therefore, the court concluded that the company was entitled to judgment.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 136-2.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence indicated that the resident was operating a home for the &quot;aged or infirm&quot; as defined in the city code, and that the trial court should have held, as a matter of law, that she was operating a home for the aged or infirm without the license required by the city, and entered judgment in favor of the city notwithstanding the verdict. The ordinance in question was enacted to protect the health and safety of persons living in homes such as the one the resident maintained and operated. Various classes of persons require such protection and the ordinance specifically designated &quot;aged or inform&quot; persons as one of the classes in need of protection.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The garnishee executed two promissory notes to the debtors, who resided in Arizona. The notes were located in Arizona. The creditor served his complaint on the debtors by publication, and the debtors filed a motion to dismiss the suit for lack of jurisdiction under a limited appearance. After the motion was filed, an attachment writ was issued and served on the garnishee. Service by publication was again made on the debtors. The debtors filed a second motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under a limited appearance. The trial court determined that the motion raised matters of defense and questions of fact, and constituted a general appearance. The trial court's ensuing default judgment for the creditor was reversed on appeal. As the garnishee's debt to the debtors was evidenced by notes located in Arizona, the garnishee's debt was not subject to garnishment by the creditor in Illinois. The debtors' contentions in their second motion to dismiss did not waive their jurisdictional objections; under &sect; 43(3) of the Civil Practice Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 167(3) (1949), jurisdictional objections were not waived merely because they were filed with other defenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment against the debtors and the garnishee, which awarded the creditor the sums due the debtors from the garnishee, was reversed. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On a snowy day, the decedent's car skidded into the oncoming lane of traffic and struck plaintiff's car, which caused injuries to plaintiff. Plaintiff commenced a negligence action against the decedent. Decedent filed his answer but died soon thereafter. The executor was appointed for the decedent's estate. The executor filed her inventory and her final report and was discharged. Plaintiff filed a petition in the probate court to vacate the final report and set aside the order of discharge, which the probate court granted. The trial court granted plaintiff's motion to substitute the executor as defendant in the negligence action. The trial court gave a jury instruction that stated that the failure of a driver of a motor vehicle to keep to the right side of the highway was excused where without negligence on his part the machine skidded across the center line. The trial court found the decedent not guilty of negligence. Reversing, the court held that it was the duty of the executor to show that the decedent skidded into the wrong lane because of some particular reason other than the decedent's negligence. The court found that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the testimony.</SPAN></P>

Appellants were convicted and assessed a fine. The court affirmed. It was conceded that the center axle of the trucks was overloaded. The evidence demonstrated that appellants had knowledge that the trucks were overloaded. Certainly the trucking company knowingly permitted the trucks to be driven on the highways with the knowledge that the load would shift. The driver also knew that this load would shift, so that some of the axles on his outfit would be overloaded. Appellants, by filing the action in the court waived the question whether the law was unconstitutional or not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client, a meat processor, hired the attorneys to recover and obtain abatement, credit, or refund of a processing tax on agricultural commodities paid directly or indirectly to the federal government. For such services, the clients agreed to pay the attorneys 25 percent of any abatement, credit, or refund. The client had obtained an injunction against enforcement of the tax through other attorneys, and following litigation by many meat processors, the Agricultural Adjustment Act was declared unconstitutional. However, the client had to pay unjust enrichment taxes on part of the taxes enjoined. The attorneys claimed that the agricultural commodities taxes that were unpaid were covered by the terms of the contract. The court disagreed, finding that the client never paid the funds covered by the injunction to the government, so they were not an abatement, credit, or recovery under the agreement. In addition, the court found that it would be inequitable to require the client to pay the attorneys a portion of the enjoined taxes when they were subject to the unjust enrichment tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner was successful in a zoning challenge and was issued an order that held that he was able to build an outdoor theater on a piece of his land. The amusement company had started construction when the city ordered that appellants were not able to continue because there were no streets leading to the site and because the construction equipment had to cross an unpaved road. Appellants argued that they had permission from the proper agency to use the road and that it was necessary to use that road because they had no other access. The petition prayed for an injunction against the city from preventing them from interfering with the construction as previously ordered. The court instead ordered that construction desist until a magistrate was able to take evidence on the matter. Appellants challenged that order. The court held that an appeal from an interlocutory order could be prosecuted under the provisions of &sect; 78 of the Civil Practice Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 202 (1949); however, the court found that there was no provision for an appeal from an interlocutory order partially dissolving the temporary injunction that had allowed construction in the first place.</SPAN></P>

The buyer appealed and the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The buyer failed to make an appearance or file a brief with the court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees filed an action to recover salaries for varying periods of their wrongful exclusion from their respective positions as civil service employees of the city park district. All the employees were fired by the park district and were ultimately reinstated under a court mandate. The trial court ruled that the park district was justified in its refusal to pay the employees any salaries until the date when a certain judgment was invoked. The employees appealed, and the park district cross-appealed. The court reversed and held that the employees, after reinstatement by mandamus proceedings, were entitled to their full salaries during the period of their wrongful exclusion. The court found that there was no proof that de facto employees had occupied the employees' positions and had received the salaries attached thereto during the employees' wrongful exclusion. The court further noted that the determinative issue was one of liability and the manner of payment, not the availability of funds for the park district to do so. The court held that none of the employees were guilty of delay in the prosecution of the action and that the park district was bound to pay the salaries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company sought review of a judgment from the Municipal Court of Chicago (Illinois), which dismissed plaintiff's action for damages against defendant company arising out of an accident involving two employees of the parties in which plaintiff's truck was damaged. Defendant filed a denial to plaintiff's action and filed a counterclaim for damages, which was also dismissed with the main action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The collision between plaintiff's and defendant's trucks occurred outside of Chicago, and plaintiff, being a resident of Chicago, filed its action for damages against defendant, a foreign corporation, in the municipal court. The municipal court dismissed plaintiff's claim and defendant's counterclaim, and plaintiff appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the legislature did not and could not confer jurisdiction on the municipal court in causes of action arising beyond the city limits, and thus, the municipal court properly dismissed the claims. The court determined that the fact that in December 1906, when the municipal court was put in operation, it took over pending cases before justices of the peace, did not tend to establish that the General Assembly intended to extend the jurisdiction of the municipal court in cases arising after that court began to function to causes of action arising outside of the city. The court found that the Illinois Supreme Court opinions held that all city and municipal courts had a limited territorial jurisdiction, which the General Assembly could not extend, and thus, the municipal court did not have jurisdiction over plaintiff's action.</SPAN></P>

The Board contended that a court of equity had no jurisdiction to enjoin the Board from dismissing a teacher or hiring a new teacher. The taxpayers argued that the rights of the teacher under the Teacher Tenure Act and the School Code were property rights, and therefore, the protection of such rights was within the jurisdiction of equity. In reversing, the court held that it was not necessary to pass upon general question so law and procedure because a statutory remedy under the School Code offered opportunity for adequate relief. Because the court found that the Board's procedure sufficiently conformed to the statute for dismissal of a teacher, the injunction should have been vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The coal companies, a parent company and its subsidiary, were engaged in the business of open cut or strip mining of coal. The companies owned or controlled a coal field in the township where the highway commissioner had authority. The corporations sought the injunction on the basis that the commissioner intended to charge them with violation of restrictions on the size and weight of vehicles that could be used to cross a township highway. The commissioner claimed that the corporations were required to obtain special permits under paragraphs 124, 131, and 133 of &quot;An Act in Relation to the Regulation of Traffic, Ill. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 221, 228 and 230 (1947). The corporations disputed the applicability of the Act to them based on their claim of ownership of land surrounding the highway, subject to an easement to permit travel on the highway. The court found that the grant of the injunction should have been vacated because the corporations were required to make a showing of a fair question of a right necessitating the maintenance of the status quo. The corporations, however, sought to avoid making an application for a permit or being charged with a violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officers had been assigned by the police commissioner to investigate 80 unsolved murders, including the shooting of one particular person. In due course the officers interviewed three witnesses from whom they obtained signed statements that they could have identified the occupants of the moving truck from which the person had been shot. Partly on the strength of their testimony and that of the officers, three men were indicted for the murder. After two witnesses recanted, the officers were later suspected of having conspired to obtain an unfounded indictment of the murder suspects, through subornation of perjury and bribery. After the officers refused to execute in writing immunity waivers when summoned, and prior to testifying before a grand jury investing the murder, the officers were discharged. The officers sought review in the lower court, which reversed the discharge stating that the discharge deprived the officers of their constitutional rights. The commissioners then sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment, holding that the commissioners' decision was proper. The court found that the refusal to sign the waiver was an actual refusal to testify.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-wife contended that the sale by the debtor to the creditor was fraudulent and void because of the creditor's failure to take possession of the property upon payment of the purchase money. The controlling question was whether the sale of the debtor's materials and equipment to the creditor was within the provisions of the Bulk Sales Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121 1/2, para. 78 (1947). The parties admitted that no effort was made to comply with the Act. The court concluded that the fact that the creditor purchased the smaller part of the debtor's business and another creditor purchased the larger part of the debtor's goods and chattels did not take the sale out of the provisions of the Act. The court found that the ex-wife was a creditor of the debtor within the clear intent and meaning of the word &quot;creditor&quot; as used in the Act because she was a creditor for support and maintenance money and the attorneys fees as provided in the divorce decree. The court held that the debtor was in default to the ex-wife, and that the debtor's sale to the creditor was fraudulent and void.</SPAN></P>

The action was brought under the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 51 et seq., and the Federal Safety Appliance Acts (FSAA). The employer's direct appeal to the state supreme court was transferred to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee fell off a railway car that was not used in interstate commerce at the time of the accident. He brought his complaint under the FELA, and based on a violation of the C. The employer contended that the injury did not fall under the 1939 amended version of the FELA because the word &quot;while&quot; limited coverage to interstate duties. A jury awarded the employee damages for his injuries. On appeal, the court first noted that the employee was not required to prove negligence because a violation of the FSAA was negligence per se. Although the court agreed that the word &quot;while&quot; had the same meaning under the amended the FELA, it was not reasonable to separate a switchman's duties at a given moment to determine what was actually interstate. The court reasoned that the amendment was intended to obviate such difficulty for employees, and indeed, the senate referred especially to railway switchmen as an example. Finally, the court rejected the employer's contention that the verdict was excessive. Any conflict in the medical experts' testimony was a question left for the jury's interpretation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant village challenged a decision of the Circuit Court of DuPage County (Illinois), which entered judgment for plaintiff Board of Trustees of the Police Pension Fund of Glen Ellyn, Illinois, in its action to recover funds wrongfully diverted from the police pension fund, and for the sum that would have been paid into the fund if certain taxes had been levied and collected. The Board cross appealed the denial of funds diverted for 1931.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the terms of the Police Pension Fund Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, paras. 892-904b (1909) (Jones Ill. Stats. Ann. &sect; 100.257 et seq.), the village was required to have paid money into the pension fund when its population reached 5,000 or more. It did not do so until 1946. On appeal, the village argued that there was insufficient proof as to the population in 1930 because the Illinois Secretary of State had not certified the population. The court affirmed the judgment with respect to the money diverted from the fund and the interest thereon, but reversed that part of the judgment for the estimated tax collections. In doing so, the court held that the village had a population of 5,000 or more in 1930, according to the 1930 Federal Decennial Census, which was determinative of the issue. Accordingly, the money the village diverted from the fund for its own use was recoverable by the Board under a resulting trust theory or a quasi contract theory. However, the failure to levy and collect the tax required by the act was a governmental function for which the village had immunity under any tort theory of recovery. Thus, the recovery for the estimated tax collections was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant unlawfully used his residence for business purposes in violation of a zoning ordinance. Defendant used one room of the house as an office for his real estate brokerage business. Defendant advertised his business in newspapers and placed a pair of signs in his yard. On appeal, defendant argued that he was lawfully engaged in a home occupation as permitted by the zoning ordinance. The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction. In doing so, the court held that defendant's real estate business could not have been construed as a &quot;home occupation&quot; of a kind that was &quot;accessory&quot; and &quot;customarily incident&quot; to the use of property for residential purposes so as to have constituted a permissible use of property in Residence District A. The court further held that there was no evidence that the village authorities ever tolerated any use of property in a residence district similar to the use of defendant's property in suit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building inspector denied plaintiffs' request for a permit to construct an addition on an existing apartment building. The circuit court entered judgment for plaintiffs and ordered a peremptory writ of mandamus compelling the building inspector to grant plaintiffs the permit. On appeal, the court reversed the circuit court's judgment, holding that plaintiffs did not establish a clear and undoubted right to the writ of mandamus. The court found that plaintiffs established a non-conforming use under the city's zoning ordinance because the premises had been devoted for the relevant period of time, and because the owner's failure to use the premises as an apartment for a three-year period did not constitute abandonment. The court held that the application of the city's building code, which construed the premises as a new apartment building insofar as new elements of the building were concerned, did not invade plaintiffs' property rights. The court found that plaintiffs were not entitled to the building permit because the plans and specifications submitted by plaintiffs to the building inspector were incomplete and contained specific violations of the building code.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 24 1/2, para. 51, and city ordinances passed thereunder, plaintiff was removed from his position as a police captain when he reached the age of 63. Plaintiff petitioned for reinstatement, claiming that he was actually born four years later than the date that he had stated in his application for appointment. Defendants denied the petition pursuant to &sect; 51, which provided that the age stated in an application for appointment was conclusive evidence against the applicant as to his age. Plaintiff sought a writ of mandamus to compel his reinstatement. The petition was granted. Defendants appealed. On appeal, plaintiff claimed that the provision relied upon by defendants was unconstitutional in that the legislative declaration of a conclusive evidentiary presumption was an invasion of the judiciary's power. The court rejected plaintiff's constitutional challenge and reversed the trial court's decision. The court noted that the constitutionality of the provision had been sustained in two prior decisions. The court thus found that the age that plaintiff stated in his application was conclusive and, therefore, that he was not entitled to reinstatement.</SPAN></P>

After the taxpayer failed to pay its franchise tax, the state issued a warrant demanding payment of a franchise tax in the amount of $ 9,269.71. In order to avoid the closure of its office, the taxpayer paid the taxes. After reviewing the annual report, the state determined that the franchise tax actually owed by the taxpayer was merely $ 209.18. The taxpayer filed a claim for a refund of the involuntary overpayment. The state filed a motion for summary judgment. In granting the motion and denying the claim, the court concluded that the taxpayer's own acts resulted in the overpayment, and Illinois did not permit a tax refund unless the tax was paid under protest. Ill. Rev. Stat. (1973) Ch. 127, &sect; 172, provided that, to recover an overpayment of a franchise tax, the taxpayer was required to have applied for an adjustment of the franchise tax and to have paid the tax under protest. The taxpayer did neither. That a penalty was threatened if the taxpayer failed to pay the tax did not render the payment of the franchise tax involuntary.</SPAN></P>

His duties were clerical in nature. During his employment the employee suffered a heart attack and died. The main issue was whether the employee was a law enforcement officer as defined by the Act. The employee wore a uniform and carried a gun. However, his duties were purely clerical. The court held that the employee was not a law enforcement officer within the meaning of the Act. He did not face the perils of a police officer. The court determined that it was not the intent of the legislature to compensate any person in uniform for a death unrelated to the risks inherent in and peculiar to the professions of firefighting and law enforcement. The court also determined that the legislature did not intend to compensate the survivors of those officers and firemen whose deaths were not directly attributable to the risks inherent to their profession. The Act was intended to compensate the survivors of law enforcement officers and firemen who were exposed to risks greater than those to which the general public was exposed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant was convicted of marijuana possession and received a prison sentence. After the statute under which he was convicted was declared unconstitutional, claimant was released from prison under a writ of habeas corpus. Claimant thereafter instituted proceedings against the state to recover damages for his wrongful imprisonment and for the abuse he received during his incarceration. The state moved to dismiss. In granting the state's motion and dismissing the case, the court rejected claimant's theory that, because the law under which he was convicted was found to be unconstitutional, he was consequently never guilty of a crime and, therefore, should automatically be entitled to compensation for unlawful imprisonment. To be entitled to compensation in an action against the state for wrongful imprisonment, claimant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence (1) that the time served in prison was unjust, (2) that the act for which he was wrongfully imprisoned was not committed, and (3) the amount of damages to which he is entitled.

The court determined that &sect; 19 prohibited the company from recovering from the State in the absence of a statute authorizing the recovery. The court concluded from the need of expanding the state hospital facilities and the authority of the State to do so, that the company was authorized to recover the additional costs. The court held that some of the items were excessive due to the lack of proof provided by the company.

The employees filed suit against the State to recover the compensation. The court held that, because the act creating the Authority was unconstitutional and because the auditor was enjoined from disbursing public funds, there was no way the general assembly could make a valid appropriation. There was no existing law. The employees sought an award for services and materials they furnished in good faith to an authority created under an unconstitutional law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">From April 1950 through January 1952, as required by the Act, the corporation filed returns with the Department of Revenue and paid the inspection fee of .0003 cents per gallon on all gasoline and kerosene received by it. Its auditor, however, during such period, in making up the tax return, included range oil and fuel oil gallonage amounting to 1,532,991 gallons within the kerosene gallonage. The auditor testified that he learned of the fact that no inspection fees were due on range oil and fuel oil early in 1952, and the instant action for refund, therefore, resulted. The court held that the corporation could not prevail because it failed to comply with Ill. Rev. Stat., 1949, Chap. 127, &sect;&sect; 172 and 172a, which required any person paying money to the State, with some exceptions, to pay the same under protest and then to proceed in chancery and obtain a temporary injunction within 30 days of such protest payment. It noted that if a payor failed to proceed in accordance with that statute, payments became a part of the general revenue funds of the State.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant citizen, citing Article III, Article IV, &sect; 26, Article VI, &sect; 1 of the Constitution, &sect;&sect; 22-1, 439.1, 439.8, 439.20 of the Court of Claims Law, Chap. 37, &sect; 439 of the Illinois Revised Statutes, House Bill No. 552 of the 70th General Assembly, filed a petition for rehearing of an opinion by the court sustaining a motion of respondent State of Illinois to strike the complaint in the citizen's claim for compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State asserted that the citizen had not filed the required notice of his claim. The citizen contended, as he had at the prior hearing, that House Bill No. 552 of the 70th General Assembly, which enacted &sect; 22-1 of the Court of Claims Law, was unconstitutional. The court allowed the motion to strike the complaint. The court observed that when it heard and determined the merits of a claim and thereafter filed its report with the legislature, it was clearly exercising a quasi-judicial function. The court stated that when it was called upon to pass on the constitutionality of an act of the legislature, it was attempting to perform a judicial function of the highest order and that as it was a commission of the legislature rather than a component part of the judicial department, it would violate Article VI, &sect; 1 of the Constitution. The court remarked that having created the court, the legislature could also establish rules, regulations, and procedures for the consideration of claims, which could not be questioned by anyone, including the court. The court found that it did not have the jurisdiction, power, or authority to rule on the constitutionality of the Court of Claims Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the majority and minority opinions previously filed by it in the citizen's action against the State be expunged from the records and further ordered that the motion of the State to strike the complaint for failure of the citizen to comply with notice requirements be allowed.</SPAN></P>

The State filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that claimant had not filed a notice of his claim as required by &sect; 22-1 of an Illinois Act, House Bill No. 552 of the 70th General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant filed objections to the State's motion to dismiss and contended that &sect;&sect; 22-1 and 22-2 of the House Bill were unconstitutional and violated &sect; 13 of Article IV of the Illinois Constitution of 1870. Pursuant to &sect; 22 of the Court of Claims Act (Illinois), every claim, other than a claim arising out of a contract, was to be barred from prosecution unless it was filed within two years after it first accrued. The court determined that if the House Bill was to be considered an amendment to the Court of Claims Act, it would violate &sect; 13 of the Constitution, which regulated the enactment and amendments of bills. The court held that &sect; 22 of the Court of Claims Act was purely a limitation statute while &sect;&sect; 22-1 and 22-2 of the House Bill related solely to notice as a condition precedent to the right to maintain a suit. Sections 22-1 and 22-2 of the House Bill, standing alone, required a claimant to give notice as a condition precedent to the right to maintain a suit. Therefore, they were amendatory acts, complete in themselves, and they were not subject to the constitutional provision. The court found that the State's motion to dismiss was to be allowed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimants contended that they raised substantial amounts of corn, beans, and other crops on lands surrounding the preserve but that wild geese destroyed the crops. Claimants further contended that the State was negligent in encouraging the concentration of the geese, which caused the destruction of such crops. The court held that the United States claimed paramount authority over the respective states in protecting migratory birds. In addition, the court found that the State, in its sovereign capacity, was permitted to pass legislation protecting wild life even though an individual may have suffered losses as a result of such wild life. Further, the losses were not compensable. The court held that the damages suffered by claimants were occasioned by the Presidential proclamation No. 2748 of October 1, 1947, which protected the geese and encouraged their concentration in the game preserve. Inasmuch as the State would not have been able to challenge the authority of the proclamation, the court found that it was not liable to claimants for damages caused by such proclamation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State raised the question of the court's jurisdiction to award consequential damages where no property had been taken. However, it admitted that claimants' property had materially depreciated by reason of the improvement. The State further contended that the court should decline jurisdiction where, as here, an adequate remedy existed in the courts of general jurisdiction. The court noted that the Legislature in creating the court did not intend that it should usurp the powers of, contradict, or compete with courts of general jurisdiction. However, under &sect; 8 of the Court of Claims law, subparagraph A, the court was given jurisdiction of all claims against the State founded upon any law of the State of Illinois. Under this provision, the court had jurisdiction to determine claims arising under the Constitution and laws of the State of Illinois, which included the Eminent Domain Act and the provisions of the Constitution on the taking of private property. The court had consistently taken jurisdiction in cases involving consequential damages arising out of the construction of public improvements. Thus, the only question was as to the amount of claimants' damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant alleged that he was unlawfully indicted for the crime of rape, convicted, and sentenced to the state penitentiary. He was ultimately discharged from prison on a writ of habeas corpus. He filed the instant action for damages, contending that his constitutional rights had been violated by the State's agents. The court held that the claimant's action was one against State officers and not against the State of Illinois and as such, the State was not an indispensable party. The court further held that the evidence showed that the claimant was sentenced by the circuit court, a court of competent jurisdiction. For the court to review a decision of the circuit court without a statute authorizing it to do so, would have meant that it was assuming jurisdiction never contemplated. Moreover, there was no statute authorizing the court to award damages to the claimant in a case such as the instant case. The court held that it was without jurisdiction to hear and determine the claim.</SPAN></P>
