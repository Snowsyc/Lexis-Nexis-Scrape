<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mobile home park owner challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County (Pennsylvania), which affirmed appellee Department of Health's decision to deny appellant's application for a certificate of registration for the mobile home park.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After receiving complaints about the operation of a mobile home park, appellee Department of Health informed appellant mobile home park owner that the park was in violation of health regulations, which would have to be met before the park could be certified as required by law. When appellant did not conform to the regulations, appellee issued a cease and desist order. Appellee's hearing officer affirmed the denial of appellant's application for a certificate of registration, as did the lower court. The court held that, under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 12010, appellee had the authority to make and enforce regulations about public health and safety. There was substantial evidence of deficiencies in the sewer system, the water supply, and the electrical system. These deficiencies created a nuisance and justified appellee's denial of the certificate. In its current state, the park was not a permissible nonconforming use because conformity to the regulations would not prevent appellant from continuing to run the park. Nor was appellee enforcing an ex post facto law. The court held that the regulations were not subject ex post facto analysis, which applied only to criminal statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order that denied appellant mobile home park owner a certificate of registration. A commonwealth statute gave appellee Department of Health the authority to issue a cease and desist order for appellant's failure to comply with health regulations. Appellee's order was supported by substantial evidence in the record. Appellant did not have a nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Warren County (Pennsylvania), which on its own motion granted summary judgment in favor of appellee Borough of Youngsville, Pennsylvania, found that appellee's ordinances were a legal exercise of police power, and further denied appellants' motion for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners wanted to drill oil and/or gas wells upon their property, but were prevented from doing so by the operation of two ordinances enacted by appellee Borough of Youngsville, Pennsylvania. Appellants challenged the validity of the ordinances in the trial court and asserted that the Oil and Gas Act, 58 P.S. &sect; 601.101 to .605, had preempted the field of oil and gas mine regulation so as to supersede local efforts to so regulate, and that the ordinances were confiscatory and, thus, unconstitutional because they effectively acted to deprive appellants of their property without due process of law. The trial court on its own motion granted summary judgment to appellee, and found that the ordinances were a legal exercise of police power enacted for the preservation of the health, safety, and general welfare of its residents. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded because no evidence was submitted on whether appellants' property rights were abridged, so there was a genuine issue of fact for the trial court to resolve, notwithstanding the court's finding that the ordinances were reasonable and validly promulgated under the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant elected member sought review of the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which dismissed her amended petition for declaratory judgment that challenged the validity of the Council's Rule of Government 2E.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant elected member challenged the validity of Council's Rule of Government 2E, which granted discretion to appellees, council and individual members, to close committee meetings to other non-committee members, borough officials and/or the public. Appellant alleged that Rule 2E was unconstitutional, and that the various appellees impermissibly excluded her from committee meetings where she was not a designated member, in violation of rights granted her by U.S. Const. amend. I, XIV. The court affirmed the denial of appellant's declaratory judgment action, and held that because Rule 2E advanced a legitimate government interest and restricted appellant's right to speak and associate in only limited circumstances, it did not violate her U.S. Const. amend. I, XIV rights. Furthermore, the court held that it could see no less restrictive alternative that would effect the local government's end. The court held that Rule 2E comported with the constitutional guarantees of equal protection of the laws and that the classification between committee members and non-committee members arose from a compelling need for the smooth operation of governments at the local level.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of appellant elected member's declaratory judgment action that challenged the validity of a local rule that prohibited appellant from attending various council meetings. The court held that there was no blanket exclusion of non-committee members from committee sessions, and the discretion to close sessions of council was narrowly limited to committee meetings where no formal action could be taken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Juniata County (Pennsylvania), which found in favor of appellees, tax claim bureau, township, county board, and school board, in appellants' action to enjoin appellees from selling appellants' properties in a tax sale due to appellants' failure to pay their real estate taxes in full.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers sought to enjoin a tax sale of their properties due to their refusal to pay the full amount of real estate taxes. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of appellees, tax claim bureau, township, county board, and school board. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellants' request for a continuance at trial because appellants made no showing at the time that the testimony of three missing witnesses would have been more than cumulative of other witnesses' testimony concerning the adequacy of police protection in the area of appellants' properties, or that the testimony of the missing witnesses would have affected the result. The court also held that Pa. R. Civ. P. 212 did not require the trial court to hold a pre-trial conference with appellants in attendance because appellants' counsel was present. The court also found that 72 P.S. &sect; 4692, which exempted veterans from real estate tax liability, was constitutional, and that appellants made no showing that they were entitled to a tax-exempt status. The court determined that appellants' tax liability was ascertainable and payable in United States currency.</SPAN></P>

Appellants were not entitled to a continuance because they did not show that missing witnesses' testimony would not be cumulative. Appellants' presence at a pre-trial conference was not required. Appellants did not show that they should be exempt from paying taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner union was the certified bargaining representative for the state police. The union asked respondent commonwealth to bargain over state police pension benefits pursuant to 43 P.S. &sect;&sect; 217.1-217.27 (Act 111). Respondent refused and argued that 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5955 of the State Employees' Retirement Code prohibited bargaining over pension issues. Petitioner claimed that reading &sect; 5955 to prohibit discussion of pensions in the collective bargaining process and also to prevent binding arbitration meant that the section was invalid as a special law regulating labor in violation of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32(7) and that the section conflicted with Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 31. In dismissing petitioner's complaint, the court held that &sect; 5955 effected no discrimination against state police with respect to collective bargaining as to pensions or as to binding arbitration concerning pension legislation, and that the prohibition against special laws did not prohibit the differentiation between state and municipal police with regard to pension entitlement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the suit for declaratory judgment filed by petitioner police union.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner judges asked the court to declare unconstitutional portions of the State Employees' Retirement Code of 1974, 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5101-5956 (1974). Petitioners also sought writs of mandamus against respondents, state employees' retirement board, treasurer, governor, and general assembly. All but the respondent governor filed special exceptions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Retirement Code of 1959, 71 P.S. &sect;&sect; 1725-101--1725-809 established a mandatory retirement system for state employees, including judges. In addition to mandatory contributions to the system judges could elect &quot;Class E-1&quot; coverage, which permitted them to contribute a higher percentage of their salaries and receive proportionately higher benefits. The State Employees' Retirement Code of 1974, 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5101-5956, eliminated Class E-1coverage, however, judges who assumed office before 1974 could continue to elect the Class E-1 coverage. Petitioner judges argued that the duties and responsibilities of judges assuming office before and after 1974 were identical and that the changes established an arbitrary classification based solely on date of entry into judicial service. In overruling the preliminary objections filed by respondent, the state employees' retirement board, the court found that it could not say with absolute certainty that the facts pleaded, if proven, would be insufficient to establish any right to relief under the equal protection or judicial impairment theories that petitioners put forth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the preliminary objections of respondents, state treasurer and general assembly, to the petition for mandamus filed by petitioner judges and ruled that mandamus could only be ordered if the statute were declared unconstitutional. The court overruled the preliminary objections of respondent state employees' retirement board on the ground that the facts pleaded could establish a right to relief.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the single excise tax violated petitioner's right to due process because it attempted to extinguish a cause of action after it had already accrued.

It was reasonable to require frequent inspections of only those dwellings occupied by lessees, especially in light of evidence adduced at trial showing more safety and health problems with those dwellings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation sought review of the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County (Pennsylvania), which upheld appellee department of health's attempt at regulation controlling the retail sale of bulk food and its enforcement against appellant's method of selling bulk food.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation operated a retail food establishment in which it sold bulk food through the use of dispensing containers. The dispensers permitted customer contact with food offered for sale to the public. Appellee department of health adopted a regulation, which was the same as a state regulation by the department of environmental resources (DER). In an equity action, appellee asserted that appellant was required to obtain a license from appellee, and the trial court agreed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, but as modified. The court found that appellee did not promulgate a county counterpart of the state regulation, 25 Pa. Code &sect; 151.171, with legal effect because it did not follow the necessary steps required to promulgate regulation. However, appellee did have licensing authority under 25 Pa. Code &sect; 151, and it could have prohibited appellant from dispensing bulk foods and could have withheld a license. The court did not find, as the trial court did, that appellant's method of merchandising was a nuisance by statutory definition. Appellant had to stop its current manner of operation until it obtained a license.</SPAN></P>

The complaint accused defendant of withholding from its renters' security deposits a sum, which the renters claimed to have been exorbitant as a charge for cleaning services to rehabilitate the rented premises upon termination of the lease. Plaintiff filed preliminary objections to the complaint which raised a question of jurisdiction, sought to strike scandalous and impertinent material, sought a more specific pleading, demurred to the complaint, and raised the defenses of lack of capacity to sue and lis pendens. In sustaining in part and overruling in part the objections and in granting plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint, the court held that it had proper jurisdiction over the matter. However, it found that plaintiff failed to plead any alleged fraud with particularity as required by Pa. R. Civ. P. 1019(b) and that the complaint failed to make out a cause of action such as was authorized by the Law. It therefore sustained defendant's motion for a more specific pleading and its demurrer.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner PCLB, along with petitioner store representatives, sought summary relief in having the Sunset Act declared unconstitutional, enjoining the implementation of respondent's order, and having the court define the legal status of petitioner PLCB after December 31, 1986. The court granted summary relief for petitioners, though it found that the Sunset Act was constitutional, because in the enactment, all legislative procedural constitutional requirements were met. The order of respondent, however, was held to be null and void. Because it was in direct conflict with provisions in the Sunset Act, the court found that it wrongfully invaded the exclusive province of the General Assembly to control every phase of the alcoholic beverage industry and was therefore invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent claimant donated a large estate to petitioner commonwealth for use by West Chester State College. Accompanying the conveyance was a statement of principles in which petitioner agreed to furnish full and first-class maintenance of the residence, contents, and grounds according to standards as previously observed, casualty and liability insurance, and security service. At first, petitioner fulfilled the terms of the statement, but it eventually breached the agreement when the General Assembly denied its funding. Respondent then was forced to fund the maintenance and upkeep and pay the insurance premiums on the estate. Upon her claim to recover her expenditures, the Board of Claims found in her favor. Petitioner appealed, but the court affirmed the board's decision after its limited review to determine whether necessary factual findings were supported by substantial evidence and whether an error of law was committed. The court found that the agreement which accompanied the conveyance was a binding contract and petitioner had breached its terms. The award to refund the insurance premiums was also proper because respondent had an insurable interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Board of Claims' decision in all respects. In its holding it found that the statement of principles, which accompanied a charitable donation of land and was agreed to by both petitioner commonwealth and respondent claimant, had become a binding contract. Because of petitioner's breach of that contract, the board was correct in awarding respondent expenses, including insurance premiums, and interest.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended the occupational assessment classification and tax as it applied to clergymen violated his right to free exercise of his religion pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. I.

On appeal the court stated that in a free exercise case, it was necessary for one to show the coercive effect of the enactment as it operated against him in the practice of his religion. The court found no hint that the tax had had a coercive effect upon appellant in the practice of his religion. At no point did appellant state that the tax prevented him from carrying out his religious practices or penalized him for his faith.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insurance company appealed an order of the Insurance Commissioner of Pennsylvania (Commissioner) which affirmed a decision of the Insurance Department of Pennsylvania disapproving petitioner's policy form filings deleting or modifying the uninsured motorist arbitration clause. The Commissioner's order was based on his conclusion that the regulation found at 31 Pa.

Petitioner argued that the commissioner did not have authority to promulgate the regulation and argued that arbitration denied it the right to a jury trial. The court, affirming the Commissioner's order, held that the Insurance Department had the authority to promulgate a regulation requiring an arbitration clause in an insurance contract because it had a statutory duty to enforce the regulation. The court stated that Pa. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board of Finance and Revenue refused petitioner taxpayer's petition for refund of franchise tax for the year ending January 30, 1982. Petitioner was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York, and was engaged in the operation of retail grocery stores located in both New York and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The issue on appeal was whether a foreign corporation which elected to be taxed under the single-factor apportionment formula could be required to include its intangible assets in the computation of its franchise tax due. The court stated that because petitioner was afforded an option to choose between the single-factor and three-factor formulas, it was this option that had to be scrutinized, as a whole, to determine it if passed constitutional muster. The court held that this option, as applied to petitioner, was constitutional. The court concluded that the option to choose between the single-factor and three-factor tax formulas, as afforded to foreign corporations, met the requirements of the Due Process Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The court affirmed the Board's decision.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that her due process and equal protection rights were violated when the arresting officer failed to give her adequate warnings of the results of her refusal. The court noted that operating a motor vehicle upon the highways was not a civil or property right but was rather a privilege subject to the commonwealth's regulation and control. The court held that the privilege of operating a motor vehicle was not entitled to strict constitutional protection and that the conditions imposed by the commonwealth upon the use of the privilege were only required to bear a rational relationship to a legitimate state objective. The court held that the law in question bore a rational relationship to the commonwealth's interests in safeguarding the public from injury and death at the hands of intoxicated drivers and affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court certified as a controlling question the constitutionality of &sect; 8553(d) of the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act (Act), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8553(d). On appeal, the court held that the appropriate level of scrutiny under the equal protection clause to be applied to the matter was the rational relationship test. Further, the court held that classifying plaintiffs who received insurance benefits differently from those plaintiffs who would not receive insurance benefits was rationally related to the legitimate government interest in clearly defining the extent to which a political subdivision was at financial risk.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was sworn into office of county prothonotary on Monday, January 2, 1984. Because New Year's day fell on a Sunday that year, the holiday was observed on Monday, and so, appellee began her commission on a day when all county offices were closed. The following day, January 3, appellee raised filing fees. Appellant filed for a writ of mandamus seeking, inter alia, to compel appellee to reinstate the former fees. On appellee's motion for a demurrer, the trial court sustained appellee's preliminary objections. The appellate court affirmed, holding that appellee raised the filing fee in a timely fashion, despite the provision in 42 P.S. &sect; 21071 that required filing fees to be raised on or before January 1, because under 1 P.S. &sect; 1908, January 1 and January 2 were not counted in determining the time limitation. Further, the court held that it was within appellee's discretion to determine what a reasonable fee was as long as the fee was within the statutory limits, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that appellant had not alleged sufficient facts to support the contention that his constitutional rights were violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner widow sought review of a decision of respondent Crime Victim's Compensation Board (Pennsylvania), which denied her claim for benefits. Respondent had determined that petitioner was ineligible to receive an award because the total amount payable to her from other sources, counted as an offset for award purposes, exceeded the amount payable to her under the Crime Victim's Compensation Act, 71 P.S. &sect;&sect; 180-7 to -7.18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner widow's husband, a deputy sheriff, was killed. She made a claim under the Crime Victim's Compensation Act (Act), 71 P.S. &sect;&sect; 180-7 to -7.18. Respondent Crime Victim's Compensation Board denied her claim under 71 P.S. &sect; 180-7.9, which required respondent to reduce any potential award by amounts payable to the claimant that the claimant was entitled to receive from other sources as a result of the crime. Respondent included petitioner's deceased's pension benefits in determining that the offset amount exceeded any potential award. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for recomputation. It held that evidence of future earnings and the impact of inflation were not relevant, and that respondent properly ignored these factors in calculating petitioner's potential award under 37 Pa. Code &sect; 191.9b(a). However, respondent had treated the victim's pension as money from public funds under 71 P.S. &sect; 180-7.9(e), which as an offset exceeded petitioner's expenses and loss of support. The court held that the pension was deferred compensation and thus not public funds and therefore not an offset under the Act. The court remanded for a corrected computation of the offset.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of respondent board that petitioner widow was not entitled to compensation from a crime victim's fund. Respondent had properly calculated the loss of support and out-of-pocket expenses but had improperly treated the victim's pension as received from public funds. Since the pension was deferred compensation it was not public funds and hence not an offset. The matter was remanded to recalculate and award benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee teacher appealed his furlough maintaining that in computing his seniority for furlough purposes, the Board of Directors (board) of appellant educational unit should have taken into account the time he served in the armed forces pursuant to 51 Pa.

The trial court reversed the board's decision and the court affirmed the trial court and determined that the legislature did not preclude the application of &sect; 7107 to 24 P.S. 11-1125.1. The court stated that the school code did not define seniority and that it was reasonable to read &sect; 7107 as supplementing &sect; 1125.1. The court held that appellee met the criteria enunciated in &sect; 7107 because as a public school teacher, he was in a public position, and he was a civil servant. The court held that the compensation of a veteran for the disadvantage he would have suffered due to his exclusion from the labor market by appending his time in the military to his other service when computing seniority for furlough purposes was a reasonable governmental objective with a rational relationship to the method employed, and application of &sect; 7107 in appellee's case withstood constitutional scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee executor filed an inheritance tax return and later filed a petition for refund. The commonwealth, through its appraiser, appraised the estate and filed a protest 61 days after receipt of the objected-to notice.

The commonwealth filed an inheritance tax record adjustment.

The lower court ordered the commonwealth to refund appellee its overpayment plus interest. The commonwealth appealed and the court affirmed the lower court's decree nisi. The court held that the commonwealth must be bound by its original appraisement taxing the estate left to the step-grandchildren at six percent. To allow the commonwealth to retain the requested refund would have amounted to taxing the estate at 15 percent, something that it is precluded from doing by its failure to take a timely appeal from the original assessment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city's ordinance that restricted commercial truck traffic did not apply to commercial trucks that had a destination within appellant's limits. Line Street was a boundary line between appellant and a township. Because appellee business was located on the township side of Line Street, and not within appellant's limits, commercial vehicles servicing it could not use Line Street, and the only alternate route was not usable. For those reasons, the lower court declared the ordinance unconstitutional. On review, the court rejected appellant's contention that the trial court's finding of fact about the unsuitability of the alternative route was not supported by substantial evidence because the lower court, the sole judge of credibility, accepted the testimony of appellee's owner. The court also rejected appellant's contention that finding the ordinance unconstitutional was error because that same argument was presented to the lower court and was disposed of in the judge's opinion. Accordingly, the court affirmed the lower court's declaration that appellant's ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the present proposal came within a permitted use category because the literal terms of the zoning ordinance, relating to the storage and disposition of discarded materials, embraced refuse of all kinds because discarded materials and refuse are synonymous. The court upheld the trial court's finding that the zoning hearing board erred when it misinterpreted the floodplain zoning provisions and map because there was no legal basis for that conclusion.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected petitioner's argument that by including certain instances of heart disease to firemen within the category of occupational disease and not similarly including such instances to policemen, the legislature created a disparity of treatment between similar classes of individuals.

Petitioner commenced mandamus actions to compel respondent to comply on the basis that respondent's policy was unconstitutional, and respondent filed preliminary objections claiming that petitioner had an adequate remedy at law and that mandamus was inappropriate because the actions of which petitioner complained were discretionary. The court agreed and held that mandamus was not the proper procedure for testing the constitutionality of a policy because its purpose was not to establish rights but to enforce those already established. The court also held that in reviewing petitioner's action as an appeal from a determination of a government unit, the action had to be dismissed because the determination was not a final order as petitioner had not exhausted all administrative remedies prior to seeking judicial review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the application for plenary jurisdiction and relief filed against respondent judges by petitioner county commissioners and county controller, who sought to obtain relief from a restraining order preventing mandatory retirement at age 70 from applying to court criers and court attendants. Under separation of powers, it found, the power to hire, supervise, and fire court personnel lay exclusively with the courts, and the mandatory retirement rule interfered with this power. It also noted that 16 P.S. &sect; 1620, which conferred upon the county salary board the power to fix the compensation of all employees paid from the county treasury and upon the county commissioners the sole responsibility to represent the judges of the court of common pleas in collective bargaining negotiations involving such employees, explicitly stated that that these responsibilities did not affect the hiring, discharging, and supervision rights of judges over their employees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner nurse appealed an order from respondent State Board of Nurse Examiners, which revoked her nursing license. Petitioner disconnected her comatose patient from his respirator to perform an unauthorized evaluation of spontaneous respiration, leaving her patient after noting that he had no heartbeat, failing to perform external cardiac resuscitation and artificial respiration, failing to immediately call the code team, and failing to attach the cardiac monitor strip to her patient's chart. Petitioner challenged the constitutionality of 49 Pa. Code &sect; 21.11(a)(4) as unconstitutionally vague. This section required nursing care actions which promoted, maintained, and restored the well-being of individuals. The court rejected petitioner's challenge because the regulation was not vague with respect to her conduct. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld respondent's findings that petitioner's actions were unauthorized, contraindicated, and a serious deviation from acceptable nursing practice. Therefore, the order of respondent was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee challenged an order of the unemployment compensation board of review, which affirmed a referee's decision that he was ineligible for benefits. The board found that petitioner accumulated less than the minimum 18 credit weeks necessary to establish financial eligibility under 43 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 804(c). Petitioner did not receive credit for 30 weeks of work that was determined to be participation in a federally assisted work relief or work training program. Petitioner argued that the board capriciously disregarded his testimony that his employment at the federally funded employer did not constitute participation in a work training program. The court affirmed, holding that the board did not capriciously disregard petitioner's testimony. The court found that petitioner worked as a foreman for the employer at $ 3.85 per hour, above the minimum wage, and that further information as to the nature of his position or duties was irrelevant in determining his eligibility for benefits. There was no merit to petitioner's claim that the classifications created under the statute were unconstitutionally overbroad as applied to claimants in his position.</SPAN></P>

Further, respondent's actions were not discretionary, but were mandated by statute.

The court designated the lower court as a neutral court under 16 P.S. &sect; 302(a), to hear the boundary dispute. The lower court after a hearing determined that the boundary line was the line found by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey of 1934, pursuant to an agreement between the two counties. On appeal, the court affirmed because the previous authority to readjust county boundaries where the existing county line became inconvenient or improper was abrogated by Pa. Const. art. 9, &sect; 8. Under that article, the general assembly had until April 23, 1970 in which to enact uniform legislation to establish a procedure for altering the boundaries of municipalities. The failure of the general assembly to so act abrogated all such pre-existing legislation that dealt with alteration of municipal boundaries and left initiative and referendum as the sole method of changing boundaries. The court held the properties should be taxed in the respective counties in accordance with the 1934 line.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner electric company and petitioner consumer advocate appealed the order. The court found that the PUC did not err in disallowing certain expenses associated with the installation of pollution control equipment because the expenses were incurred during a test year for which petitioner electric company had already been granted a rate increase, the expenses had not been included in the projected expenses for that year, and the expenses were neither recurring nor so extraordinary as to justify recovery now. The court also found that the PUC did not err by allowing the inclusion in the rate base of expenses for nuclear fuel because nuclear fuel was neither a plant, nor equipment, nor a facility as used in 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1315. The court remanded the decision of the PUC for a definitive finding of whether inclusion in the rate base of expenses for system reinforcement was proper pursuant to &sect; 1315 as safety improvements.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment. The commission's interpretation of its own regulation, 58 Pa. Code &sect; 63.3(a), was entitled to controlling weight, and the particular rule used to measure mesh size of appellant's gill nets was not required to be proven as a necessary element for proving a violation of the statute. The evidence established the accuracy of flexible rules used to measure appellant's gill nets and the commission's compliance with its own regulations. The court also found that appellant waived argument that he was prosecuted under the wrong statutory section by failing to present it in either the pre-trial proceedings or during trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner county commenced a declaratory judgment proceeding in the court (Pennsylvania) against respondent commonwealth requesting an order that respondent provide all funds necessary for the functioning of all parts of the unified court system and, specifically, all funds necessary for the functioning of petitioner's court of common pleas.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In considering petitioner county's request for a declaratory judgment against respondent commonwealth, the court found that the legislature had committed the financial underpinning of the county judicial system to the counties, and the court was compelled to hold that only the legislature could make a change in funding. The court concluded that the matter was non-justiciable. While the court had the authority and the duty to declare legislative enactments unconstitutional where they offended the state constitution, the court had no power to fashion a judicial remedy requiring the legislature to fund the county court system when that obligation had been imposed on the counties. The court held that petitioner lacked standing to raise the issue of varying salaries on behalf of employees who were not parties to the action, and the payment of different salaries to employees in different counties with similar occupational titles had a rational basis for differentiation, because the work and duties of an employee in the courts of a metropolitan area would necessarily vary from those of a similar employee in a less populated area. The court was compelled to sustain respondent's demurrer.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner county's request for a declaratory judgment was denied. There was no justiciable controversy, and the court was without the power to fashion the remedy requested by petitioner.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the project served the public interest and was not ultra vires under the Municipal Authorities Act, 53 P. S. &sect; 301-22. The court held that the agreements did not allow appellee electric company to exercise governmental powers in violation of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 31, as appellee electric company was only authorized to have limited input as to the implementation of a county's proprietary contracts and was not permitted to interfere with discretionary functions. The court found that the breaching county was not at liberty to void the agreements merely because of public sentiment against the project and the court ordered specific performance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, the city and its insurer, entered into an agreement for workmen's compensation payments for a claimant who was injured while serving in the volunteer fire department. The claimant received payments for a continuing partial disability based upon an average weekly wage as provided for in &sect; 601 of the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act, 77 P.S. &sect; 1031. Despite these agreed upon payments, petitioners filed a petition to modify alleging that &sect; 601 was unconstitutional and the amount of payments should be modified. Petitioners appealed the decision of respondent workmen's compensation board dismissing their motion, and the court affirmed. The court held that there was no novelty in a wage computation formula that reflected a justifiable social purpose such as &sect; 601. The court concluded that it saw in &sect; 601, as with other provisions for computing a wage that may not be directly related to the injured employee's actual earnings, a provision that was rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The court found no constitutional defect in &sect; 601 that called for a ruling to strike down its wage provision, and affirmed respondent's decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of respondent workmen's compensation board, as the applicable statute's wage provision was not unconstitutional, and the amount of compensation payable to the claimant, who was injured while serving in petitioner city's volunteer fire department, did not need to be modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hazardous waste transporters petitioned for review of an adjudication of the environmental health board which dismissed their constitutional challenges to &sect; 505(e) of the solid waste management act, 35 P.S. &sect; 6018.505(e), which required them to file a collateral bond with the department of environmental regulation (department) as a condition for state hazardous waste transport licenses. The court disagreed with appellant's contention that &sect; 505(e) was preempted by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 or by the Resource Conservation Recovery Act as their express language disclaimed preemptive intent. The court held that equal protection was not violated when collateral bonds were imposed upon transporters but not on owners of hazardous waste as transporters and owners were not similarly circumstanced. The court finally rejected appellants' argument that the department's unpublished documents used to determine bond assessments were void for having been promulgated without compliance with the documents law as the documents were interpretive and rather than legislative. Accordingly the adjudication of the board was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adjudication was affirmed because there was no evidence that congress intended to preempt state regulation of the transportation of hazardous waste, equal protection was not violated by bonding requirements and department's unpublished documents used for bond assessments were interpretive and therefore exempt from the rulemaking procedure of the commonwealth documents law.</SPAN></P>

The court, in affirming the lower court's dismissal of the initial appeal, disagreed and cited extensive testimony in the record to that effect. Appellant also argued that, even if he made the calls, that conduct was insufficient to support his dismissal. The court disagreed. 24 P.S. &sect; 5-514 of the Public School Code specifically delegated to appellee the authority to dismiss an employee for &quot;improper conduct&quot; and the court determined that appellant's conduct fell within that definition.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner company appealed an order of respondent Department of Labor and Industry (Pennsylvania), which affirmed the decision of the Office of Employment Security, denying petitioner's contribution rate appeal. Petitioner challenged the constitutionality of the unemployment compensation law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 781(d)(2), and attacked the classification, allowing the contribution rate of a successor-in-interest, as arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner company had an established employer contribution account and it merged with another company but retained its old name. Petitioner's contribution rate after the merger was determined under the Unemployment Compensation Law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 781(d)(2). Petitioner applied for a redetermination of its contribution rate, after the transfer, requesting that its former subsidiary's experience record and reserve account balance be considered. The Office of Employment Security denied the application and respondent Department of Labor and Industry affirmed. Petitioner challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 781(d)(2) on equal protection grounds and argued that the statute was not rationally related to the legislative goal that a successor-in-interest would be assigned only one tax rate for the entire transfer year. The court, affirming respondent's order, held that the classification in the statute bore a rational relationship to the legislative goal. The court stated that because petitioner was a successor-in-interest before the transfer, two different tax rates could apply during the same calendar year. The court rejected petitioner's claim of unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of respondent department of labor and industry, upholding petitioner company's contribution rate. The court concluded that the classification in the statute bore a rational relationship to the legislative goal, such that where the successor-in-interest was an employer before the transfer a potential for two applicable rates existed. The court rejected petitioner's claim of unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The court held that petitioner could not establish legal rights by mandamus because the purpose of mandamus was to enforce those rights already established; however, the court asserted its appellate jurisdiction over the action. The court held that former &sect; 897 did not involve a fundamental right, nor did convicted offenders who received consecutive sentences at the same time in the same court qualify as a &quot;discrete and insular group&quot; in need of extraordinary protection; as such, where &sect; 897 bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state objective, namely that of effective administration of the corrections and parole system while also preserving the integrity of consecutive sentences imposed by the trial court, petitioner's equal protection challenge had to fail.

The court reversed. The agreement was reflective of the dichotomy of control established by case law where it contained provisions related solely to the issues of hiring, firing and supervising employees. These were matters regarding which the county commissioners could not effectively negotiate because these matters were not within their control. However, the court held that once a public employer entered into an agreement on matters of managerial prerogative, where there was no obligation to bargain, the employer will be bound. Appellee was bound by the agreement to arbitrate.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review and argued that the exemptions for churches and charities were self-executing and that it should not have to follow the administrative procedure to obtain an exemption. The court disagreed and held that where the legislature had provided a statutory remedy that was mandatory and exclusive, equity was without power to act in relief of a party who failed to pursue that remedy.

The evidence showed that appellants failed to make the required repairs to bring the building up to the building code and that the building was dangerous to the public. In addition, vandalism, rotting wood, and wind damage made the property a hazard.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania) sustaining the validity of the reassessment program initiated by appellee assessment board. Appellant sought to prevent appellee from collecting a higher levy pursuant to the General County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. &sect; 5020-402(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer brought an action against appellee assessment board to contest its novel reassessment program, and appellant sought to prevent appellee's consequent collection of a greater levy. The court reversed the trial court order that affirmed appellee's program. The court found evidence indicating that appellee's program would geographically cover all of the county and that about 90 percent of all properties would be reassessed. The court rejected appellee's argument that because only 10 percent of those properties would be assessed at a precise market value and the rest of them would not be, no county-wide reassessment would occur. The court determined that appellee's program constituted a de facto county-wide reassessment triggering the delay provisions of the General County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. &sect; 5020-402(a), as they applied to this third class county. Therefore, the court declined to address appellant's contention of unconstitutional discrimination by appellee. The trial court was reversed because the Law &sect; 5020-402(a) prohibited any levies by appellee on county-wide reassessments until all the assessments were 100 percent completed using the proper procedures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court order that affirmed the validity of the reassessment program developed by appellee assessment board because, although appellee only intended to specifically assess 10 percent of the properties, appellee's plan imposed a county-wide reassessment on all properties. Therefore, the court enabled appellant to prevent appellee from collecting the higher levy because its plan triggered the statutory delay provision.</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellant failed to file an appeal from the zoning officer's order to remove the sign within 30 days from its issuance. The issuance by a district justice of a citation was not a decision of the zoning officer, and its propriety was not a matter appellee had the power to decide; therefore, it was an unappealable order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This action involved a township's adoption of a reapportionment plan. Plaintiff electors filed a petition contesting the plan. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court set aside the plan. Thereafter, defendant reapportionment commission devised a second reapportionment plan that divided the township into seven wards. The trial court confirmed the second plan and thereby reapportioned the township from nine to seven wards. Plaintiffs appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in its earlier order setting aside the township's first reapportionment plan. The appeals court reversed the trial court decision which accepted the appointed reapportionment commission's report as final. The court also reversed the earlier decision setting aside the township's reapportionment plan and reinstated the original plan. The court reasoned that the record was devoid of evidence that defendant had access to any data regarding socioeconomic indicators and the considerations of financial status, race, and religion did not intrude upon the formulation of the plan. Hence, because plaintiffs did not establish a prima facie case of discrimination, defendant was not required to justify the plan.</SPAN></P>

The court held that notwithstanding the abstract statement of purpose set forth in 72 P.S. &sect; 7402 to exact from businesses payment for the exercise of the privilege of doing business in the Commonwealth, the corporate net income tax was a tax on income. There was no economic consequence that followed from the use of the particular words, &quot;privilege of doing business&quot; and a focus on that formalism merely obscured the question.

The trial court retained jurisdiction during the pendency of the proceedings. Appellant argued on appeal that jurisdiction was conferred upon the court pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons.

The court held that an adjudication had to dispose of the entire case, end the litigation, or effectively put the litigant our of court in order for it to be considered a final and appealable order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff widow filed a motion for summary judgment in the trial court (Pennsylvania) arguing that the State Employees Group Life Insurance Act (Act), 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 780.2, which reduced life insurance benefits for employees 65 years of age or older, had no rational basis, and, thus, it violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 26. Defendant agency filed a cross motion arguing &sect; 780.2 was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff widow's husband was a state employee until his death at the age of 69. Defendant agency provided group life insurance coverage for state employees under the State Employees Group Life Insurance Act (Act) and paid life insurance benefits for any insured employee over the age of 65 at a 35 percent reduction than that provided to younger employees. Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment seeking the balance of the maximum benefit allowable. Defendant filed a cross motion for summary judgment, which the court granted. The provision that reduced benefits for older employees within the Act, 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 780.2 did not violate the equal protection clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 26. The court held that the age classification rationally furthered a legitimate state purpose to reduce life insurance costs based upon statistical evidence of five-year age cost comparisons which showed older employees' insurance costs increased significantly. The court found further justification for the different treatment because &sect; 780.2 was in compliance with the Age Discrimination in Employment Act's, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 631 guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant agency's cross motion for summary judgment because the provision of the State Employees Group Life Insurance Act that reduced life insurance benefits for employees 65 years of age and older furthered a legitimate state purpose of reducing the costs of insurance associated with insuring such employees. Thus, it did not violate the equal protection clause of the United States and Pennsylvania constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant class representative challenged an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), that limited damages to a nominal amount in a class action suit that challenged the constitutionality of procedures for hearings on the validity of tows under appellee city's towing ordinance, Philadelphia, Pa., Code &sect; 12-2406.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant class representative filed a class action on behalf of individuals whose vehicles were towed pursuant to Philadelphia, Pa., Code &sect; 12-2406. The trial court ruled that appellee city's towing ordinance's provision for a delayed hearing was unconstitutional, but determined that class members were not entitled to refunds of towing or storage fees, and therefore limited damages to a nominal amount. The trial court also granted appellant counsel fees. The appellate court affirmed the limitation on damages because it was not error to refuse to refund towing and storage fees when the constitutional defect pertained only to the collection fees, and the loss of use of those fees during the delayed period before a hearing was held. There was no defect in the hearing procedures and thus class members suffered no harm by the ultimate adjudicated loss of paid fees. However, the appellate court reversed the grant of counsel fees to appellant. Neither 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1726(1), nor 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2503 authorized counsel fees when the trial court decertified the class due to the nominal damage award and no common class fund was created from which to pay counsel fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part the order that limited appellant class representative's damages to a nominal amount, because there was no right to a refund of towing and storage fees to class members when the constitutional defect in appellee city's towing ordinance related to the collection of fees without a prompt hearing. The court reversed the award of counsel fees granted appellant because there was no basis for the award.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the examination of &sect; 9902 in conjunction with the simultaneously enacted registration fee reductions demonstrated that &sect; 9902 violated the Commerce Clause under U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured student brought suit against defendant school district and teacher seeking to recover damages for injuries she suffered while in a physical education class. On appeal, the court affirmed the order from the trial court granting summary judgment in favor of defendants and dismissing plaintiff's complaint. The court found that the spring board and vaulting horse on which plaintiff was injured were items of moveable property and were not fixtures as they were not permanently placed at the school nor essential for its operation. That equipment was not a part of the real property, therefore, the care, custody, or control of real property exception to governmental immunity did not apply. The court held that defendant teacher was acting within the scope of his official duties at the time of the incident and was entitled to immunity under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 42, &sect; 8545. The activity of the class, gymnastics, was an activity normally associated with an indoor physical education program.

The statute prohibited solicitation by a public adjuster of clients within a 24-hour period following a fire or catastrophe. Petitioner complained that so much of its business was proscribed by the statute that it would not longer be able to conduct business. Petitioner argued that private insurance companies, and other trades and businesses were not so limited and, therefore, petitioner's constitutional rights were violated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, applied for a preliminary injunction to enjoin respondent hazardous waste corporation from refusing access to its property to petitioner's employees who had sought to conduct inspections and collect effluent and ground water samples.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court's order which found petitioner hazardous waste corporation in civil contempt for having violated a consent agreement with respondent, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, had been appealed by respondent corporation. In the meantime, petitioner applied for a preliminary injunction to enjoin respondent from refusing access to its property to petitioner's employees who sought to conduct inspections and collect effluent and ground water samples. The court held that the injunction application was ancillary to the initial contempt action that sought to determine whether respondent had complied with the court's order, and was therefore properly before the court. The court denied the injunction, and held that although Solid Waste Management Act &sect; 608, 35 P.S. &sect; 6018.608, and Clean Streams Law &sect; 5(b)(8), 35 P.S. &sect; 691.5(b)(8), were intended to allow petitioner to conduct warrantless searches, the grant of power was violative of U.S. Const. amend. IV. The statutes lacked most of the necessary qualities which would make them constitutionally sound, where they did not attempt to set up an inspection scheme which could arguably be a substitute for a warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, a preliminary injunction granting them access to petitioner hazardous waste corporation's property for inspection, because although the Pennsylvania Solid Waste Management Act and Clean Streams Law were intended to allow warrantless searches, such searches violated U.S. Const. amend. IV absent an inspection scheme that could arguably have substituted for a warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pastor was held in contempt and jailed after he was ordered to desist from performing any pastoral functions at the Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church or any other church in that denomination, and not to interfere directly or indirectly with the performance of pastoral functions at that church by other pastors designated to perform them by the Bishop of the Synod. Petitioner appeared in the pulpit of that church on the following Sunday, and the pastor designated to appear by the Synod was excluded. Petitioner was committed to jail and filed a writ of habeas corpus after an adjudication of contempt. The court held the contempt order was civil where it imposed prison conditional on an expression of willingness to comply with the decree of the court. The court held that habeas corpus proceedings could be heard by the appellate court, if a court has ordered contempt in a civil matter, the appellate court would not dismiss the petition on procedural grounds but would consider the committing court's legal power to impose incarceration.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner corporation disputed an order of the Board of Finance and Revenue, which sustained the resettlement of petitioner's 1977 capital stock tax by the Department of Revenue of respondent Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The court held that 61 Pa. Code &sect; 153.26(a), which mandated the exclusion of dividends and interest on United States obligations from the sales factor of the capital stock tax apportionment, controlled the case. The interpretation embodied in the regulation was reasonable and not clearly inconsistent with the statute. The court distinguished a case decided under 72 P.S. &sect;&sect; 3420a - 3420-11. Because the status of dividends was disputable, the court applied rules of statutory construction to determine the legislative intent. The inclusion in the sales factor of dividends and interest on the obligations could result in the statute being held unconstitutional, so the court held that they were excluded. Further, respondent had presented its arguments as equally applicable to the dividends and to the interest. The court reversed, entered judgment for petitioner corporation, and remanded for a recomputation of the capital stock tax liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner citizens and others sought declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting the commonwealth from implementing statutes, which restricted the expenditure of public funds for abortions. The chancellor issued a decree, which declared the legislation unconstitutional and prohibited the enforcement of 62 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 453 and the 1982 Abortion Control Act, 18 Pa. Cons.

The court held that the right to abortion was a qualified one and that the state was not prohibited from regulating abortion for purposes of safeguarding health or for protecting potential life. The court held the commonwealth was free to assert its preference for childbirth over abortion by allocation of public funds. The court also held that the legislation did not involve a gender based classification under the equal rights amendment, Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 28.

Appellant denied recovery stating that appellee was not a designated beneficiary and did not meet the durational requirement.

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. According to the court, where the classification did not discriminate against a suspect class or impinge upon a fundamental right, the level of equal protection analysis which a court must apply was the rational relationship test. The court held that under the rational relationship test, a court could not examine the application of a statute to individual members of a class as part of its equal protection analysis. The court stated that if the classification bore some rational relationship to a legitimate government end, then it was within the legislative power, and would be upheld. The court concluded that the trial court erred in its analysis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In one of two consolidated appeals, respondent Unemployment Compensation Board of Review granted benefits to claimant one, court-appointed employee. In the other, respondent denied claimant two, court-appointed employee, benefits because she voluntarily quit work without necessitous and compelling reason. On appeal, the first decision was reversed, and the second was affirmed. The court held that neither claimant was entitled to unemployment compensation. The provisions of the Ethics Law, 65 P.S. &sect;&sect; 410 and 412. could not provide a legal foundation for good cause with respect to either claimant. Provisions of the Ethics Law were held invalid to the extent that they invaded upon the state Supreme Court's authority to administer the courts. Because the Supreme Court's power to supervise the judicial system was not subject to legislative regulation, Ethics Law provisions that infringed upon that power were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision that awarded claimant one unemployment benefits, and affirmed the decision denying claimant two unemployment benefits, holding that neither claimant was entitled to unemployment compensation.

Respondent filed preliminary objections that raised a lack of jurisdiction and the failure of the petition to conform to law or rule of court. The court held that respondent alleged sufficient facts that were proof against petitioners' preliminary objection. Respondent had the power to issue subpoenas pursuant to the Pennsylvania Crime Commission Act, 71 P.S. &sect; 1190.7 independently of the enforcement procedure found in 71 P.S. &sect; 1190.4(7). Further, pursuant to Administrative Code, &sect; 520, 71 P.S. &sect; 200, respondent was required to seek a court hearing on the merits of the subpoenas through a petition for enforcement.

Plaintiff brought the action to restrain defendants, stereo electronics shop owners, from playing amplified, recorded music in violation of the ordinance and regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city cited defendant stereo electronics shop owners for emitting recorded, amplified music from their store at decibel levels violative of plaintiff's Noise and Excessive Vibration regulations. A determination was made that provisions of plaintiff's ordinance were facially unconstitutional for vagueness and overbreadth. On appeal, the decision was reversed. The court held that the regulation was not substantially overbroad. Whatever overbreadth existed was to be corrected through case-by-case analyses of specific factual situations, and not by generally invalidating the regulation for facial overbreadth. In addition, although the phrase &quot;adverse psychological and physiological effects&quot; lacked quantitative precision, the language embodied a normative standard sufficient to guide prospective conduct. Further, employment of a decibel scale to objectively measure amplified sound levels was not a denial of fair warning of prohibited conduct. The phrase &quot;beyond the property boundary&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague because the property boundary definition insured fair enforcement by designating the sound level measurement zone as that area beyond the property boundary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision that plaintiff city's ordinance and regulations were facially unconstitutional because of vagueness and overbreadth, holding that when business enterprises were regulated, vagueness standards were relaxed. The court ruled that whatever overbreadth existed was to be corrected through case-by-case analyses of specific factual situations, and not by generally invalidating the regulation for facial overbreadth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city enacted an ordinance that amended its wage and net profits tax by increasing the tax rate for all taxpayers for residents of respondent city only. The rate for all non-resident taxpayers remained the same. Petitioner sought review in the court's original equity jurisdiction challenging the constitutionality of the non-resident wage tax cap and the ordinance. On cross motions for summary judgment, the court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment in part. Under the Uniformity Clause, Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, the court declared unconstitutional the non-resident wage tax cap and ordinance, which were enacted pursuant to 72 P.S. &sect; 7359(b), the so-called Philadelphia Non-Resident Wage Tax Cap. The court said that the Pennsylvania Constitution clearly required uniformity within the territorial limits of an authority levying a tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner land and fuel company commenced this action in the court's original jurisdiction (Pennsylvania) seeking equitable and declaratory judgment relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court was whether either party was entitled to summary judgment. There appeared to be no factual dispute. Petitioner land and fuel company contended that the bond requirements of the Surface Mining Conservation and Reclamation Act, 52 P.S. &sect; 1396.22, and the Clean Streams Law, 35 P.S. &sect; 691.605, violated the mandatory right of appeal created by Pa.

The court held that the bond requirement ensured the underlying validity of appeals and served to protect the public interest in a safe and clean environment. The court held that a party challenging the constitutionality of a statutory provision had a heavy burden to overcome the presumption of its constitutionality. The court concluded that petitioner did not meet that burden. The court held that summary judgment could be granted when there was no dispute as to any material issue of fact. The court held that since there were no material facts in dispute, the Commonwealth was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant university challenged a decision from the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which held that a charitable gift made to it by testator had failed under 20 P.S. &sect; 195 of the Wills Act of 1917. Appellant contended that &sect; 195 had been invalidated and that it should no longer be precluded from recovering under the terms of the will.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residuary clause of a will provided that a trust would be created for the benefit of a several individuals, including the decedent's wife and sister. However, upon their deaths, a sum was to be paid from the trust principle to appellant university. Shortly thereafter the account of the personal representative was audited. The auditing judge noted that under the Wills Act of 1917, 20 P.S. &sect; 195, the charitable trust could not be established since the testator died within 30 days of executing the will. Years later, after the death of testator's wife and sister it was adjudicated that appellant's gift had failed. Approximately 25 years later, &sect; 195 was declared unconstitutional and of no effect. When the last of the beneficiaries of the trust died the estates of the wife and sister appellant claimed the remainder. The auditing judge awarded the funds to the estates, based on the adjudication that the bequest to appellant had failed. On appeal, the court held that the undistributed portions of the trust were not subject to the prior audits or adjudications and that, due to the invalidation of &sect; 195, the remainder of the trust must go to appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the trial court, to award the remainder of a trust to the estates of the testator's wife and sister rather than appellant university, was reversed. The court held that the statute invalidating the gift to appellant had been declared unconstitutional and that the portion of the trust, which the will originally designated as a gift to appellant, should be awarded to appellant in accordance with the provisions of the will.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the trial court that the agreement did not prevent other governmental units from enforcing any environmental law that it was empowered to enforce. Additionally, appellee was not a party to the DER contract and was not bound. The court agreed that the DER took precedence when a conflict existed between its administration and that of appellee, but found it irrelevant as the DER assured appellee that its activities did not conflict with those of the DER.

Therefore, the court determined that &sect; 1542 clearly passed constitutional muster under a rational relation standard.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company sought to construct and operate an underground, hazardous waste refuse facility. Appellee township was granted a preliminary injunction against the facility because it violated North Codorus, Pa., Zoning Ordinance No. 18, &sect; 4(c), which prohibited the facility from being within 500 yards of a structure occupied by humans. Appellant challenged the validity of the zoning ordinance on constitutional and state preemption grounds. The court affirmed the order of the lower court and found that while appellee could not set geological or engineering standards stricter than those established by the Department of Environmental Resources, under 35 P.S. &sect; 6018.105(h), it was not prohibited from enacting restrictions relating to aesthetics, population density, and accessibility. The court found that appellee had a substantial interest in protecting and promoting the public health, property values and aesthetics of the community, and that appellant had failed to show that the 500 yard zoning restriction was not substantially related to the public health, safety, and welfare of the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners claimed statutes providing that no commonwealth funds or federal funds appropriated by the commonwealth be used to fund abortions, unless a physician certified that the mother's life would be endangered if the fetus were carried to full term or the pregnancy resulted from promptly reported rape or incest. The court permanently enjoined enforcement of the provisions of 62 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 453 and 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3215(c), finding that &sect; 453 offended the equal protection provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution and violated Pa. Const. art.

I, &sect; 8, and violated the right to privacy guaranteed to victims of rape and incest by the state and federal constitutions. The court found that the funding restriction unduly burdened the fundamental right of indigent women to have medically necessary abortions, that the statutes made a discriminatory sex-based distinction, and that the state's interest in prompt reporting of rape and incest was not so compelling as to override the obvious and injurious invasion of a victim's right to privacy.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that the appeal period should have been measured from the time of receipt of the notice of suspension and not the time of mailing, and that the provisions of the statutes deprived him of his constitutional rights of due process and equal protection. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the statute did not present a clear, palpable, or plain violation of the constitution. All prospective appellants were subject to the delivery offered by the postal service, and the likely number of days for mail delivery were deemed to create a reasonable appeal period.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order that affirmed a decision of the liquor control board to revoke his restaurant liquor license. The revocation of appellant's liquor license was based on permitting beer to be furnished or given to minors, permitting the use of a controlled substance on the premises, and selling liquor for consumption off the licensed premises in violation of section 406 of the Liquor Code, 47 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4-406. Appellant argued that if the other sufficient cause standard was constitutional, then a single instance of permitting the use of a controlled substance on the premises could not provide the basis for a license revocation. The revocation was not grounded solely on the basis of the controlled substance charge. The revocation, instead, was supported by the cumulative effect of the three violations. The court concluded that the finding that the use of a controlled substance was permitted on the licensed premises, particularly when considered together with the other violations, supported the instant revocation.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that a petition to open a default judgment can prevail if the following three factors coalesce: a) the petition is promptly filed; b) a meritorious defense can be shown; and c) there is a reasonable excuse for failure to file an answer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant employee sought disability compensation benefits for permanent partial disability from silicosis under the Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act (Act), 77 P.S. &sect;&sect; 1201-1603. Respondent workmen's compensation appeal board dismissed claimant's petition for failure to prove that he was totally disabled from silicosis as required by section 301(e) of the Act, 77 P.S. &sect; 1401(e). The trial court affirmed expressly rejecting claimant's constitutional challenges to &sect; 1401(e). On appeal, the court found that while &sect; 1401(e) denied claimant compensation for partial, but not total disability due to his silicosis, and barred a common law negligence action against his employer, there was no deprivation of due process. By accepting the legislature's intent to bring all silicosis sufferers under the Act, claimant agreed to look solely to the Act for compensation. Claimant's equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV were not violated because the legislature's desire to limit the impact on the industrial economy was a legitimate objective, which was reasonably related to the Act's classification of partial silicosis as not being compensable.</SPAN></P>

The court reviewed the legislative history of the statute and concluded that the statute was intended to exclusively tax foreign-registered vehicles.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Department of Public Welfare, entered into a contract assuming complete management of a state-owned facility, and notified appellee employees that they would be furloughed. After the trial court entered an injunction, appellant rescinded the furloughs of some employees. After 50 P.S. &sect; 583.1 was enacted, the injunction was lifted and appellant furloughed appellees. The State Civil Service Commission (Commission) held that some furloughs were improper and granted appellees back pay for the period, but held that appellant properly furloughed the employees of the state-owned facility. On appeal, the court held that the finding that some of the furloughs were improper was supported by substantial evidence, as appellant was required to prove not merely that funding was inadequate, but that a rational relationship existed between the lack of funding and the furloughs undertaken. The court held that appellees' due process rights were not violated as appellant was not required to provide appellees a reason for the furlough on the notice, counsel was allowed to review documents, and the consolidated appeal did not result in confusion. The Commission's order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a consolidated group of state government employees' labor unions and individual workers, challenged the constitutionality of Act No. 31 of 1983 (Act 31), which required most state employees, participants in the state's retirement system, to contribute an additional one and one-fourth percent of their salary to the State Employees' Retirement Fund (fund). Petitioners contended that Act 31's increase in the employee contribution rates without an increase in benefits constituted an improper treatment of contract rights and that Act 31 violated state law requiring the employer state to insure the actuarial stability of the fund. The court granted petitioners' application to enjoin the state from collecting pension contributions in excess of the five percent basic contribution rate. It held that Act 31 was unconstitutional as to those employees whose rights to retirement benefits had already vested, because the increased contribution rate effectively diminished the benefits received. It was unconstitutional as to those employees whose rights had not yet vested, because it did not contain any new benefit to offset the fiscal disadvantage of the increased contributions.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the Commission's order and found that substantial evidence existed that warranted a finding of sex discrimination, there was no appreciable variation in skill, responsibility or effort between the jobs which justified the difference in pay and the fact that the court clerks worked night shift was not persuasive because other employees were not paid differently for the same position on different shifts including other court personnel.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the courts of the commonwealth had been addressing issues of attorney's fees for several hundred years, and it was well within the ambit of the constitutionally discrete power of the judiciary to regulate fees charged by lawyers. The court rejected respondent's argument regarding the similarity of provisions in other statutes, relating to the payment of compensation for unemployment, job-related injuries, and loss or injury due to crime, which contain limitations on the fee to be charged by the claimant's attorney because in each of the enactments, the general assembly created the remedy, which had not previously existed as a common law cause of action, as did medical malpractice.</SPAN></P>

It held that since an occupation tax was not an income tax, there must be some connectional link between the income exemption provided in the statute and the occupation tax, and determined the link was that only income producing occupations were taxable. The court also determined that the issue was not whether homemakers or retired persons did something of value for themselves or for others, but whether what they did produced a realizable pecuniary benefit which could be used by them to acquire property or support a family. Finally, the court held that the constitutional issue was without merit and it need not consider whether this was a reasonable classification of persons with occupations since they were not subjects of the tax when neither retired persons nor homemakers had taxable occupations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, city residents, requested a preliminary injunction be granted that would restrain respondents, the governor and others, from enforcing the Non-Resident Cap found in 72 P.S. &sect; 7359(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971. Petitioners contended that the cap, which limited for non-residents only the amount a city could tax on their income, had no justification for treating residents differently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, city residents, wanted the Non-Resident Cap found in 72 P.S. &sect; 7359(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 declared unconstitutional. The cap limited the tax rate that the city could impose on the salaries, wages, commissions and compensation received by non-residents, but set no similar limit on the tax rate applied against compensation earned by city residents. Petitioners sought a preliminary injunction to enjoin the city from enforcing the amendments. The court regrettably denied the application for preliminary injunction because, although the court found the cap unquantifiable and unrealistic, the greater injury would result by the grant of an injunction. The court reasoned that if it granted the injunction, the effect would have devastated the budget of the city. Petitioners did not establish that the greater injury would result by the denial of the injunction and the court, therefore, would not grant a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the request for a preliminary injunction of petitioners, city residents. The court found that petitioners had not satisfied their burden of showing that the greater injury would result by the denial of the injunction. Although the court agreed that the non-resident cap on taxes imposed on non-residents was unfair to residents, it would be too disruptive to the city's budget to enjoin enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Department of Public Welfare provided public assistance to petitioner claimant and her family pending receipt of the husband's social security disability insurance benefits. Upon receipt of the benefits, at respondent's caseworker's instructions, petitioner repaid respondent. Petitioner later filed for a refund with the Board of Finance and Revenue (board) and appealed the board's denial to the court. The court reversed the board's decision and entered a judgment in petitioner's favor. The court determined that the five-year limitation period under 72 P.S. &sect; 503(a) applied to petitioner's claim pursuant to a two-part test. Petitioner reimbursed the commonwealth pursuant to &sect; 207 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 407, which prohibited states from using legal process to obtain public assistance reimbursement from a recipient's social security benefits. The court found that, although respondent's collection method did not constitute legal process, respondent's caseworker misinformed petitioner and affirmatively misled her to believe she had a legal duty to make repayment from the protected benefits. Therefore, the reimbursement was not obtained by fair means.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant department of transportation sought review of the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Bradford County (Pennsylvania), which stated that its original order that gave appellee diabetic driver's license back to him should have been reversed. The appeal was treated as an appeal from the decision that restored the license. Appellant contended that, under the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1504, 1509, appellee was not qualified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant department of transportation revoked the school bus driver's license of appellee diabetic driver. Appellant cited the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1504, 1509, which required that school bus drivers had to be physically qualified to obtain a license. Specifically, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1517(b) required no medical history of diabetes. The trial court reversed appellant's decision. On further appeal, the court reversed the order and reinstated the revocation of the license. The court found that appellee was not deprived of a fundamental right even though he used the license to drive and for his livelihood. The license was a privilege, not a right. Appellee presented no evidence to refute the underlying assumption of &sect; 1517(b). Absent any refutation, the court did not find appellant's decision and its method of ensuring safe school bus drivers were irrational. The court did not deviate from traditional equal protection and due process analysis, even where appellee challenged a statutory presumption. The classification adopted by appellant was not suspect, did not impair fundamental rights, and was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the original order of the trial court, that had allowed appellee diabetic driver to retain his license. The court held that appellant department of transportation's suspension of the license was reinstated because appellee did not rebut the presumption that diabetic drivers were hazardous to the safety of buses. The court used traditional equal protection and due process analyses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant land owners owned land that included six acres of forest land. Appellants applied for a preferential property tax assessment for their forest land pursuant to the Pennsylvania Farmland and Forest Land Assessment Act of 1974, 72 P.S. &sect;&sect; 55490.1 - 5490.13. The Board of Assessment Appeals determined that appellants' were not entitled to preferential tax assessments under the Act. Appellants sought review of the trial court's decision, which affirmed the board. Appellants argued that, although Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2(b)(i) did authorize special tax treatment for forest reserves, the uniformity clause remained applicable and required that all forest land be treated alike without regard to acreage. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that as a result of the adoption of Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2(b)(i), the general assembly was empowered to treat &quot;forest reserves&quot;, &quot;agriculture reserves&quot; and &quot;land actively devoted to agricultural use&quot; as separate classes of real estate entitled to special provision for taxation which were not subject to the uniformity clause.

Petitioner then appealed the denial of back pay. Affirming the Commission's decision, the court held that the Commission did not abuse its discretion by refusing to order back pay because petitioner's actions called into question his integrity. The court reasoned that petitioner's job was a position of responsibility and trust, thus his failure to indicate that his criminal convictions were not fully disclosed on his application warranted a penalty although they did not warrant a suspension or removal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, parents of injured student, argued that appellee school district failed to take adequate measures to protect appellants' child's safety and failed to supervise the other students, one of whom allegedly injured appellant's child. The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment, citing the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, Act of November 26, 1978, 53 P.S. &sect; 5311.101 (repealed 1980), and holding that appellee was immune. Appellants argued that the act was unconstitutional as applied to the facts and circumstances of their claim and in light of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 14, which provided for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public education to serve the needs of the commonwealth. The court rejected appellants' arguments and held that school districts were immune under the act. The court found that Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 14 was never intended to mean that tort liability should be imposed upon a school district when students were injured in the course of the school day, even if there was negligence on the part of the school officials. The court therefore affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to appellee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner and similarly situated unemployment claimants sought review from respondent Unemployment Compensation Board (Pennsylvania), which upheld the Office of Employment Security's deduction of social security old age payments from petitioners' unemployment compensation weekly benefit rates in accordance with &sect; 404(d)(iii) of the Unemployment Compensation Law, 43 P.S. &sect; 804(d)(iii).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimants, all of whom were age 62 or over, were laid off by their respective employers due to lack of work. Petitioners filed for unemployment and were found to be eligible for benefits under &sect; 404(d)(iii) of the Unemployment Compensation Law, 43 P.S. &sect; 804(d)(iii). However, the weekly benefit rate was reduced by the amount of social security payments received. Petitioners objected to the reduction. Respondent Unemployment Compensation Board upheld the Office of Employment Security's deduction and the matter was appealed. On review, the court determined that the classification established by the law was rationally related to legitimate governmental purposes. The court upheld respondent's finding requiring the deduction of disqualifying retirement income from the weekly benefit rates. The order was affirmed in that respect. However, the court found that the offsetting of disqualifying wage-replacement income was not provided for under the statute. Therefore, the action by respondent was contrary to law and the decision was reversed and remanded in that respect.</SPAN></P>

But, the order offsetting the disqualifying wage-replacement income was contrary to law where it was not provided for under the Unemployment Compensation Law. That part of the order was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

A referee denied her benefits under the Unemployment Compensation Law &sect; 402(b), 43 P.S. &sect; 802(b), and respondent Unemployment Compensation Board of Review affirmed. Petitioner appealed to the court. The court affirmed. Moving to joining a relocated spouse could provide a necessitous and compelling reason to quit employment thereby entitling one to unemployment compensation. It had to be determined whether or not the relocation was the result of circumstances beyond the husband's control or instead was the product of a purely personal preference. The court relied on respondent's finding that petitioner's husband was regularly transferred to different job sites. The court found that the record showed nothing that contradicted this. The court held that the transient nature of the husband's work prevented it from ruling that petitioner's quitting her job was necessitous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a police sergeant, responded to a complaint and thereafter discovered that his mace and other gear had been stolen from his police vehicle.

Appellees, the board of commissioners, approved the demotion. Appellant then filed a complaint in equity against appellees in the trial court to enjoin appellees from holding a hearing on his demotion in rank. The trial court dismissed the complaint and appellant sought the court's review. The court held that a court would only exercise its equitable powers when the statutorily prescribed remedy had been exhausted. Here, a statutory remedy clearly existed under the First Class Township Code, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55645, which stated that the method of appealing reductions in rank required the person who was reduced in rank to appeal to the county court of common pleas.

Claimant contended that by virtue of a 1980 amendment to the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, federal law pre-empted 43 P.S. &sect; 804. This amendment referred to the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendment Act of 1980. The court held that the Pennsylvania law clearly met the minimum standards as set forth in federal law. Accordingly, it could not be said that state law was in conflict with federal law as to render the doctrine of preemption applicable. The court also dismissed claimant's procedural due process claim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners filed a petition for review in the nature of an action in equity for themselves and as representatives of a class of taxpayers in respondent school district, contending that the tax levy on their properties was not uniform with the tax placed on the property of other district residents who resided in another county. Petitioners argued that they had no statutory remedy available to them, and thus sought an injunction and a rebate of excess taxes billed to them. Respondent raised several preliminary objections. The court held it was of the opinion that the petitioners did not have an adequate statutory remedy and that equity was therefore proper. Also, because petitioners had also brought suit in federal court, that court's decision on petitioners' federal claims was res judicata, but not so as to petitioners' state law claims. Laches also did not operate as a valid bar to petitioners' action, because respondent had been aware of petitioners' contentions. As such, the preliminary objection by respondent in the nature of a demurrer raising res judicata was sustained only to petitioners' federal law claims, and all other preliminary objections were overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employer challenged an order from respondent, the Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board, denying its claim for attorney fees and costs. Petitioner contended that claims filed by respondent employees were filed in bad faith and that, therefore, it was entitled to recover the costs and fees necessary in defending the claims. Petitioner noted that &sect; 440 of the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act (Act), 77 P.S. &sect; 996, imposed attorney fees on an employer when it unreasonably contested a claim. Petitioner argued that the same principle should apply when an employee brings a claim in bad faith. The court affirmed the order denying petitioner's claims for costs and fees, finding that &sect; 440 of the Act was not unconstitutional because it was rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The court explained that the Act was intended to benefit employees. Finally, the court explained that it was not authorized to review respondent employees' claims to determine whether they were filed in bad faith.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner transferred life insurance policies of his clients from one company to another and converted refund checks to his own use.

One issue on appeal was whether respondent violated his constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy by fining him under the Insurance Department Act of 1921 (Act), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 40, &sect; 279 after the court had already imposed a criminal penalty. The court held the Act empowered respondent to impose a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars for each violation upon evidence of conduct which disqualified an agent from initial issuance of a license. Because the language of the Act authorized civil rather than criminal sanctions, the court held that respondent's fine was civil and not criminal.

The court noted that pursuant to 72 P.S. &sect; 5511.7, petitioner's failure to receive notice of the school tax did not relieve him from the payment of that tax.

Petitioner claimed that the law deprived her of due process as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court affirmed, and held that the property right to practice a profession was not an absolute vested right, and the practice of a profession can legitimately be regulated under a state's inherent police power. The law in this case was directed to safeguarding the public health, as part of the state's broad police powers because it insured that hygienists practice only the limited services, which their education has prepared them to perform. Thus, the law had a rational basis and was not oppressive or arbitrary. Nor did the law violate petitioner's rights under the equal protection clause because the provisions of the law applied equally to all persons engaged in the practice of dental hygiene, none of whom were subjected to restriction, or held entitled to privileges, different from those allowed any other hygienist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner utility companies challenged a notice and certification issued by respondent secretary of revenue. Petitioners contended that because they were precluded from challenging the calculations made by respondent by way of the refund provisions of the fiscal code, that the notice and certification, without prior notice or hearing, constituted a violation of their due process rights. They argued that they were entitled to a remand for a hearing to ascertain the manner in which these calculations were made by respondent. The court reversed the order of the trial court and held that because respondent failed to present a strong reason why the government's interests required that this determination should have been made without notice or opportunity to be heard by petitioners, some type of minimal due process was required to protect petitioners' due process rights. Without an opportunity to at least submit questions and written objections to the calculation of this surtax, petitioners were precluded from receiving even a modicum of due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Montgomery Township Zoning Ordinance previously was held unconstitutional for excluding mobile home parks. Appellee development partnership, claiming a right to build quadruplexes, argued, and the trial court agreed, that the prior decision nullified the entire zoning ordinance, leaving the municipality wholly without zoning, and that the invalidity could not cured by amendment, but only by reenacting the zoning. The court found little procedural difference between enactment of an original zoning ordinance and an amendment, where the valid land-use controls would remain to protect the rest of the municipality. Appellee's case rested on inapposite dictum that did not, by invalidating one use, deregulate all others. That authority cited by appellee questioned whether an exclusionary zoning ordinance could be amended by allowing the excluded use in a location other than the one as to which a challenger applied. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court had held only that municipalities could not &quot;zone around&quot; a successful challenger. The court, therefore, reversed the lower court's order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department of Environmental Resources (DER) determined that petitioner landowner violated the Dam Safety and Encroachment Act, 32 Pa.

The court held that the DER's finding that the condition of petitioner's property was causally related to the flooding was adequately supported by testimony. However, the court found that 25 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner utility filed revised tariffs with respondent Public Utility Commission that were designed to increase its annual operating revenues. Respondent determined that a smaller rate increase was necessary, and ordered petitioner to file revised tariffs. Respondent later issued an order delaying the rate increase for 21 days. On appeal, the court held that the Public Utility Code (Code), 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1302-1303 (1976), did not prohibit respondent from ordering retroactive rate relief. The court held that there was nothing in the Code to support the 21-day delay in the receipt of rate relief following PUC's determination that an increase was needed. Finally, the court held that the delay in the receipt of increased revenues that were found to be necessary, at a time when petitioner was producing compliance tariffs and required supportive materials, appeared to have violated 66 Pa.

Defendant sought review of her conviction on the grounds that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, that her conviction violated her due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 because it was based on intent transferred from remote third party manufacturers, and that her trial counsel was ineffective as a matter of law. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the ordinance was not vague as applied to defendant because the items she was charged with selling fell clearly within the definition of &quot;drug paraphernalia&quot; and the ordinance required that the trier of fact find that she sold the items knowing they would be used in conjunction with prohibited controlled substances.

Appellant challenged the trial court's decision which affirmed respondent's denial of a zoning permit and special exception, while respondent challenged an order reversing its order that appellant pay the fees for an attorney and engineer hired by the township to oppose appellant's applications. The court affirmed the trial court's order as to the fees; however, it reversed the trial court's decision regarding appellant's applications. The court found that the ordinance had unconstitutionally banned a legitimate business use of land because the ban was not sufficiently related to issues of health and safety.

Pursuant to the local zoning ordinance that prohibited shale excavation on any land in the township, a cease and desist order was issued and appellant sought review of the trial court's decision which denied its appeal from the order. The court reversed the trial court's decision because the court found that the ordinance was exclusionary because it totally prohibited a legitimate business use of appellant's land and appellee was unable to demonstrate that the ban bore a sufficiently substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare to justify the prohibition. The court found that the ordinance was not prima facie valid because it totally excluded the excavation of shale, therefore, the court focused on the purpose of the ban to determine the validity of the ordinance. The court held that the concerns regarding the adverse impact on tourism and noise and vibrations from blasting were unfounded and insufficient to justify the ban.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school district passed a resolution suspending appellee teachers from their positions in the secondary schools due to a substantial decline in student enrollment. Both parties challenged the trial court's order which upheld that action only in part. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. It affirmed to the extent that appellees were not denied due process, because they were not entitled to preliminary hearings prior to suspension. The court reversed, however, to the extent that the trial court applied an incorrect statute in evaluating the criteria underlying the choice of which teachers to suspend. The action was governed by 24 P.S. &sect; 1125(b) rather than a later statutory provision, because the law to be applied was that in effect on the date of the suspension, not the date of the adjudication. As the trial court applied the later law in assessing claims, the case was remanded for appropriate determinations under the law in effect on the date that appellees were suspended.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners initiated an action against respondents that sought enforcement of Act 148. Petitioners' application for preliminary injunction was denied and both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment because under Act 148, respondents were required to make the reimbursements. The court found that respondents had approved petitioners' child welfare plans prior to requesting the appropriation from the commonwealth and, therefore, abused its discretion when it failed to request the necessary funds.

Petitioner steel corporation filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment against respondent, arguing that &sect; 1307 was unconstitutional on the ground that it failed to afford procedural due process. Respondent filed a demurrer, arguing that the court was without jurisdiction to hear the lawsuit. The court held that a declaratory judgment was the proper procedure to determine whether a statute violates the constitutional rights of those whom the statute affects, however, the court should refuse declaratory relief if the controversy at issue can be resolved by alternative means. The court determined that petitioner had a option to administrative seek review of the ECR after it has been approved by seeking a refund with interest. The court stated that because petitioner had a remedy, the court was without jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief. The court sustained the demurrer in respondent's preliminary objection and dismissed the lawsuit because the court was without jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parent challenged the decision of defendant educators to exclude plaintiff's children from gifted and talented school programs on grounds that these programs violated U.S. Const. amend.

The court held that plaintiff failed to state a cause of action because she did not claim that her children qualified as &quot;gifted and talented school-aged persons&quot; under 22 Pa. Code. &sect; 13.1(ii) or that her children were ever denied the right to be evaluated or considered for admission to the program.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant association of court reporters sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which affirmed an order of appellee, the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, vacating its prior order of certification in favor of appellee union and setting aside appellee union's prior petition for representation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, court judges and the state labor relations board, argued that appellant court reporters association lacked standing to challenge appellee board's order decertifying appellee union as appellant's representative because it was not a party to the decertification proceeding. Disagreeing, the court observed that 2 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 702 granted a right of appeal to any person &quot;aggrieved&quot; by an state agency action even though the person was not a &quot;party&quot; within the meaning of Pa. R. App. P. 501. Appellant was aggrieved in being denied the right to bargain as a homogeneous unit, the court added, as it had a substantial, direct, and immediate interest in appellee board's action. The court then rejected appellant's contention that the res judicata and law-of-the-case doctrines barred appellee board from reconsidering its prior finding of unit appropriateness. However, the court agreed that appellee board exceeded the scope of a state supreme court remand order, which merely directed it to identify the employer authorized to bargain with appellee union, rather than to reconsider its original certification order, which it could not do absent a petition for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order of appellee labor relations board vacating its prior order of certification in favor of appellee union reversed, and certification order reinstated, because appellant court reporters association had standing to challenge appellee board's decertification order, as it was a party aggrieved by state agency action, and because appellee board exceeded the scope of a remand order limiting it to identifying the employer authorized to bargain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, husband and wife, filed a petition to set aside the tax sale, conducted by appellee county, of their former real estate by contending that they were not afforded the notice required by &sect; 602 of the Real Estate Tax Sale Law, 72 P.S. &sect; 5860.602, and that appellee purchaser paid an inadequate purchase price at the tax sale. The court affirmed the trial court order denying appellant's petition on both grounds. The court ruled that the precedent appellants invoked regarding the mail notice issue was inapplicable. The trial court correctly found that appellants failed to rebut the prima facie presumption of the regularity of the acts of public officers after the deputy sheriff scotch taped the notice of intended sale in a conspicuous place on the door of appellants' premises. The court found that the case law cited by appellants to contend that the purchase price was inadequate and to set aside the sale were inapplicable. The court ruled that a statutorily satisfactory price afforded no grounds to prove unjust enrichment to set aside a sale. The court confirmed the sale of appellants' property after concluding that it occurred according to the provisions of &sect; 5860.602.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff power company sought a writ of mandamus in order to compel defendant Secretary of Revenue to make settlement of tax returns filed under the Public Utility Realty Tax Act, 72 P.S. &sect; 3171. Defendant also sought declaratory relief from the court as to the duties and responsibilities of defendant as applied to the administration under 72 P.S. &sect; 1. Defendant did not have a formal settlement procedure in place; therefore, taxpaying utilities were foreclosed from filing petitions for resettlement and were relegated to contesting overpayments under the refund provisions of 72 P.S. &sect; 1. Based on a decision by the Attorney General, which imposed a duty on defendant to engage in settlement of taxes, plaintiff requested a mandamus, asserting that this opinion created a mandatory duty for defendant to settle these returns. The court held, as a matter of law, the provisions of 72 P.S. &sect; 1 did not require that all 72 P.S. &sect; 3171 returns needed to be settled by defendant. Accordingly, the court denied plaintiff's request for mandamus, but granted plaintiff's request for declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. When requested to take a breathalyzer test, appellant refused. Appellee, the Pennsylvania Secretary of Transportation, suspended appellant's motor vehicle operating privileges for six months, pursuant to Section 624.1(a) of the Vehicle Code of 1959, 75 P.S. &sect; 624.1(a), for refusing to submit to a breathalyzer test. The lower court dismissed an appeal of the suspension. Appellant sought further review, contending that the Director of the Bureau of Traffic Safety's refusal to answer interrogatories was improper, and that Section 624.1(a) was unconstitutional because it contained an open-ended penalty. The court disagreed. The six-month suspension was set forth in appellee's standard schedule of suspensions. Suspension of licenses was an administrative function constitutionally delegated by the legislature that allowed appellee to determine periods of suspension. The refusal to answer interrogatories was proper because they related to issues irrelevant to the case, the Director's consideration of the suspension determination. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner interested persons brought an action to restrain implementation of 62 P.S. &sect; 453 on the grounds that it violated freedom of religion, due process, privacy, and equal protection rights. The act restricted the use of public funds for abortions unless the procedure was necessary to save the woman's life or if she was a rape or incest victim. Respondent Department of Health further required the victim to report the offence within 72 hours of its occurrence. Respondent filed preliminary objections contending that petitioners failed to state a cause of action. Relying on the reasoning of a Supreme Court case, the court held that the act did not violate equal protection or due process rights. Because medical funding was not available to any woman needing an abortion to preserve her health, the court held that the act did not interfere with petitioners' religious freedoms. Absent direct and immediate injury, the court concluded that none of petitioners had standing to challenge respondent's reporting requirement, which was reasonable. Accordingly, the court sustained respondent's preliminary objections.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the geographic distribution requirement set forth in &sect; 2872(b) was unconstitutional because it diluted the voting power of the electorate who resided in more populous counties in choosing an official who was to be elected by voters in an at-large state primary. The court found that the state's interest as implemented by &sect; 2872(b) was not compelling, that an alternative method to achieve legitimate state aims was available, and &sect; 2872(b) could not withstand strict scrutiny evaluation. The court dismissed the objections because the geographic distribution requirement for signatures on nomination petitions contained in &sect; 2872(b) violated the &quot;one person one vote&quot; principle and was unconstitutional, and the nomination petitions at issue exceeded the requisite number of unchallenged signatures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant treasurer sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of the 59th Judicial District for Elk County (Pennsylvania), which held that appellee elected officials, who had received compensation increases under a state statute subsequently declared constitutionally inapplicable, did not have to reimburse for such unauthorized receipts and had to be paid at the rate established prior to the inapplicable statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted 16 P.S. &sect; 11011-1 on October 7, 1976, which established compensation increases for certain county officials. One section of the statute provided that it would take effect immediately and would be applicable to each officer when permitted by the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Based on a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision, appellant treasurer refused to sign any pay vouchers for the affected officials at either the new rates or the former pay rates. The trial court held that appellee elected officials need not return pay increases previously received, but must be paid at the rate established prior to enactment of 16 P.S. &sect; 11011-1. The court reversed the trial court's decision as to the requirement that appellees need not return the pay increases received under 16 P.S. 11011-1. The court noted that appellees as elected officials had no inherent right to keep the additional compensation as they were only entitled to the salary expressly authorized by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, property owner and user, had several unregistered vehicles exposed to the elements that had not been moved for four to ten years on appellant property owner's property. Appellee township contended appellants were in violation of South Londonderry, Pa., Junkyard Ordinance &sect; 212 and South Londonderry, Pa., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 508. The trial court determined that the vehicles were a nuisance in fact. The court affirmed and held that under 53 P.S. &sect;&sect; 10101-11202, 65510-65512, appellee had the capacity to bring the action without an exhaustion of its statutory remedies and appellee's solicitor was authorized to bring such action. Section 212 was not invalid because it did not automatically make appellants' activities a nuisance in fact and there was sufficient evidence to prove that the activities were a nuisance in fact and violated the ordinances. The court also held that the term &quot;junkyard&quot; in &sect;&sect; 212, 508 were not irreconcilable, the term &quot;discarded&quot; was not so vague as to make the ordinances unconstitutional, the issues of nuisance in fact were properly raised before the trial court, and the vehicles were not &quot;stored,&quot; as proved by their condition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant builder owned property on which it constructed a single-family dwelling and related improvements, including an individual on-site sanitary sewage disposal system. The disposal system was the subject of an installation permit and a certificate of compliance issued by the county health department. Following the completion of the improvements and receipt of a final inspection, appellant applied for a certificate of use and occupancy, which appellee township building inspector denied because appellant had not posted a bond for the on-site sanitary sewage disposal system as required by a township ordinance. Appellant brought an action in mandamus, seeking to compel appellees, the building inspector and the township board of supervisors, to issue the certificate and to declare the ordinance unconstitutional. The trial court denied the requested relief. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the ordinance requiring a bond was unreasonable and unduly burdensome, because it required a developer to be an insurer of an approved on-site sanitary sewage system he installed without provision for a natural catastrophe or the intentional or negligent act of the user.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied appellant corporation's petition for the allowance of real estate tax appeals. Both county assessment boards sought review of the orders of the trial court. The court held that the amended section to the General Assessment Law, 72 P.S. &sect; 5350, granted appellant corporation and appellee partnership automatic reviews of those assessments which were time-barred before the amendment became effective.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant engineering company was brought into a suit in equity that sought to enjoin the discharging of sewer water on some property. Appellant filed an action against appellee Department of Environmental Resources, which alleged that appellee negligently approved the plans for the sewage plant. Appellee filed a demurrer that alleged the defense of sovereign immunity. After appellee's demurrer was sustained, appellant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed and found that Act 152, 1978 Pa. Laws 788, reinstated the doctrine of sovereign immunity except for eight categories where immunity was waived. The court found that sovereign immunity did not lie for actions before September 28, 1978 and that it was a bar to actions which accrued after that date unless it was set out as an exception pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8522. The court found that the accrual of the original cause of action brought by the landowners was after September 28, 1978. The court found that the case against appellee was barred by sovereign immunity because the action was not in the exceptions. Finally, the court found that Act 152 was constitutional pursuant to Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, which sustained the demurrer of appellee Department of Environmental Resource raising the defense of sovereign immunity, because the cause of action accrued after the statute which reinstated sovereign immunity was enacted.

The court held that appellants were required to avail themselves of their statutorily prescribed remedies notwithstanding the fact that a constitutional question may be present, unless the statutory remedies were inadequate. Appellants did not show that the statutory remedies available to them were inadequate. Therefore, appellants' cause of action was inadequate to invoke equitable jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner widower's wife died as a result of a work-related accident. Petitioner was denied death benefits by a referee, which denial was affirmed by respondent Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board.

Respondent wife's employer in turn argued that the disparate treatment of &sect; 562 of widows and widowers was substantially related to important government interests. The court disagreed. The court found that the statute discriminated against a male surviving spouse. The court found the statute to be underinclusive because widowers who were capable of self-support were denied death benefits even though they were actually dependent upon their wives' income, while widows who were capable of self-support received death benefits if they established that they were living with their husbands at the time of their death or were actually dependent upon their husbands. Thus, the court found &sect; 562 to be unconstitutionally discriminatory.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Commonwealth sought review of the decision entered by the Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which struck down as unconstitutional Philadelphia's Obscenity Ordinance, Philadelphia, Pa. Code ch. 10, &sect; 1100 (1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cases on appeal and transfer from municipal court were consolidated for review of the decision striking as unconstitutional the Philadelphia, Pa. Obscenity Ordinance (Ordinance), Pa. Code ch. 10 &sect; 1100 (1977). The court found that the statute revealed neither an express nor implied legislative intention to prevent municipalities from enacting supplemental pornography legislation. When comparing the ordinance with the State Obscenity Act (Act), 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5903, for inconsistencies or contradictions, the court disagreed with the lower court's holding that the ordinance was preempted because it conflicted materially with the Commonwealth's legislation, specifically with regard to the Act's jury trial provisions, since the ordinance prosecuted defendants in municipal court without a jury. The court found that defendants cited under the ordinance would suffer no constitutional deprivation since they had an absolute right to a jury trial in the Common Pleas Court, the second tier of the cities' two-tier prosecutorial system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision and remanded the matter, concluding that there was no legislative intent to prevent municipalities from enacting supplemental pornography legislation, that the city ordinance did not conflict materially with the Commonwealth's legislation, and that the provision for trial by jury in the city's two-tier prosecutorial system removed any constitutional deprivation alleged in the municipal system.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the machines were unlawful gambling devices and ordered them destroyed and their money forfeited under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5513(b). On appeal, the court affirmed. The police had probable cause to seize the machines because they were lawfully on the premises when they saw them. The slot machines and two other machines were used or possessed in violation of &sect; 5513(a), making them subject to confiscation and forfeiture under &sect; 5513(b). The court found the Gold Cup and Draw Poker machines were gambling devices per se because they had the requisite factors--consideration, chance, and reward.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent State Ethics Commission issued an opinion to petitioner attorney prohibiting him from representing any client before the State Senate or the Public Utility Commission (PUC), or perform certain other enumerated functions before those bodies, for one year after the expiration of his term as a State Senator. Petitioner sought review of respondent's order as it applied to his activities before the PUC. The court held that under the common and approved usage of the term &quot;associated&quot;, petitioner was not associated with the PUC solely by reason of his chairmanship of a legislative committee that dealt with the PUC among other agencies, bureaus, and commissions. Further, pursuant to case law precedents, the Ethics Act, 65 P.S. &sect; 403(e), was an impermissible intrusion by the legislature into an area reserved by the Constitution to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Since petitioner was a member of the bar, the Supreme Court regulated his conduct in the rendering of professional legal services to clients with business before the PUC. Accordingly, respondent's order was reversed insofar as it attempted to regulate petitioner's representation of clients before the PUC.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, respondent governor filed answers to the petition whereupon petitioner filed a motion for summary judgment. The court held that a motion for summary judgment was appropriate in declaratory judgment proceedings, and therefore, petitioner's procedure was proper. The court also held that the statute was an impermissible invasion of the legislature into the exclusive power and authority of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.

The court sustained defendant's preliminary objections and dismissed plaintiffs' complaint finding that plaintiff gas company had no legal existence, and thus no capacity to be a party to the suit, and plaintiff management corporation, as a private corporation, had no standing to press four of the constitutional challenges because it was not directly or substantially affected in a legal sense. The court also found that, even if plaintiff management corporation had standing to challenge the statute as violative of the right of local home rule, no cause of action was stated on that claim because the statute that granted home rule rights did not deprive the state legislature of the power to regulate the proprietary, private businesses of home rule cities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant land owners sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County (Pennsylvania) which dismissed appellants' complaint in equity relative to the condemnation of easements by appellee water company for installation of a water line across appellants' properties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant land owners challenged appellee water company's condemnation resolution, which allowed appellee easements to place water lines through appellants' properties. The trial court interpreted an earlier trial court ruling as having dismissed appellants' equity complaint. Appellants contended that they were denied due process of law when appellee filed a motion to transfer decision on the rule without notifying appellants. The court decided to look past procedural flaws, and made a determination on the merits of the case, reversing the order of dismissal and remanding the matter. The court found that the Business Corporation Law, 15 P.S. &sect; 3241, provided a procedure by which the power to condemn may be challenged. Because it would be unconstitutional to deny appellants the right to challenge the taking of their land, appellants' proper remedy was through an action in equity. The matter was remanded to allow appellants a trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order dismissing appellant land owners' complaint in equity relative to the condemnation of easements by appellee water company for installation of a water line across appellants' properties was reversed. Although statutes did not provide for a challenge to condemnation, constitutional principles required that appellants be allowed to challenge the condemnation. Thus, appellants' action in equity was allowed to proceed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver had accumulated a total of 13 points in less than two years. Accordingly, his license was ordered suspended for 65 days by the secretary of transportation, under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1539. The lower court affirmed. Appellant did not challenge any of the convictions that led to his total point accumulation, but challenged the constitutionality of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1550(c) because it deprived him of an operator's license without a fair hearing by limiting the issue on appeal to the identity of the motorist. The court affirmed, holding that appellant's contentions were utterly devoid of merit. Section 1550(c) was not the source of power by which appellant's operator's privilege was ordered suspended. It was suspended under &sect; 1539. In addition, &sect; 1550(c) extended the scope of the judicial hearing to the identity of the motorist and to the issue of whether the privilege was subject to the recall, suspension, cancellation, or revocation. Moreover, under &sect; 1550(c), the lower court was not limited to a determination of the identity of the licensee, but had to hear evidence upon, and reach the merits of the suspension.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured person sought review of an order that dismissed his action in trespass against respondent Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation. The order declared that appellant's action, which alleged that respondent negligently failed to repair a pothole, was barred by the statute of limitation under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5524(2). Appellant contended that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's retroactive abrogation of the governmental defense of sovereign immunity had revived his cause of action against respondent. Specifically, he claimed that respondent's prior immunity was analogous to situations in which a tortfeasor concealed his victim's cause of action, thus tolling the statute of limitation until the cause of action was discovered. The court affirmed and held that pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5522, the statute of limitations was maintained in cases where the legislature had waived sovereign immunity. The court found that to permit an exception to the statute of limitations would have injected life into countless claims against respondent concerning evidence which was unavailable and subjected respondent to numerous fraudulent claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee was in a probationary civil service position when he subsequently filed for nomination to political office. Petitioner was dismissed for violating the proscription against political activity for employees in classified service, under the Civil Service Act (Act), Pa. Stat.

Probationary employees were within the meaning of classified service as defined by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 71, &sect; 741.3(d)(1), for purposes of prohibitions found in &sect; 741.904. The court rejected petitioner's assertion that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 71, &sect; 741.603(a) was a penal statute that provided the exclusive criteria for removal of probationary employees, because such a construction could create absurd results with respect to other statutes permitting the removal of probationary employees. Section 904 was not unconstitutionally vague when read in conjunction with the Act as a whole. Nor did the Act create unconstitutional classifications when there was a legitimate interest in requiring persons to choose between civil service or a political career.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of petitioner employee from his probationary civil service position for political activity under the Civil Service Act. Probationary employees were classified service subjecting them to removal under statutes that were not penal in nature, nor unconstitutionally vague. Finally, there was no unconstitutional classification because there was a legitimate interest in treating classified service differently.</SPAN></P>

Appellee was denied an occupancy permit because a group home was an institutional house and the subject property failed to meet the area requirements for that use pursuant to appellant's zoning ordinance. The trial court granted appellee's challenge to the denial of the permit, and found that the ordinance unconstitutionally excluded the use of property within the municipality for group homes, and imposed unreasonable lot size requirements for that use. The appellate court held that the definition of an institutional house included group homes, and that the ordinance unconstitutionally de facto excluded group homes because it could not ignore the actual exclusion of group homes from the municipality. The minimum lot size requirement was the invalidating feature because it required a minimum lot size much larger than that required for its proposed use, and appellant did not present evidence as to the public interest to be protected by those requirements.

On appeal, the court found no constitutional infirmity in respondent's failure to notify petitioners when samples of the fertilizers were taken because consumers located far from petitioners often made such requests. The court rejected petitioners' attack on the sampling method used by respondent, because it was reasonably related to the purpose of protecting consumers. Although the court found petitioners' claim persuasive that the investigational allowance was calculated for a different type of fertilizer, the court found that it was not so unreasonable as to violate due process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city officials challenged the order of the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which enjoined the implementation of the pay scale for 26 elected city offices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city council, by a unanimous vote of those members present, passed a bill that raised the salary of numerous appellant city officials. Appellees, citizens and residents of appellant city and organizations, filed a suit in equity to enjoin the implementation of the pay scale for all 26 elected offices. The trial court entered a decree nisi enjoining the payment, acceptance or receipt of any increase in salary or benefits arising from the ordinance. The court affirmed the order in part, holding that appellant sheriff, city commissioners, register of wills, and district attorney, were dependent on appellant city's legislative branch for compensation. The court reversed as to the other officials, holding that appellant city council properly maintained and shouldered the responsibility for compensation of the council members, mayor, city controller, clerk of court of quarter sessions, oyer and terminer, and general jail delivery. The court held that, as to these officials, the ordinance did not violate the Pennsylvania Constitution, that there were no statutory prohibitions to the ordinance, and that common law principles of conflicts of interests were pre-empted by statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order as it applied to the salaries of several appellants: sheriff, city commissioners, register of wills, and district attorney, holding that appellant city commission could not raise the salary of those officials.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner licensee appealed an order from the Commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance that revoked petitioner's licenses to act as an insurance agent or broker, pursuant to the Insurance Commissioner's power under the Insurance Department Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 40, &sect;&sect; 233(a), and 252, and 31 Pa. Code &sect; 33.7(a) and (b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner licensee was convicted of federal crimes, and almost three years later had his licenses to act as an insurance agent and broker revoked based upon those convictions. The court affirmed. There was no impermissible commingling of prosecutorial and adjudicative powers when the commissioner of insurance initiated revocation proceedings against petitioner and then ultimately decided to revoke petitioner's licenses. Further petitioner failed to show actual bias, thus preliminary inquiries into the probable cause to revoke did not raise a risk of prejudice sufficient to taint the revocation after an adversarial hearing. The Insurance Department Act (Act), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 40, &sect;&sect; 233(a), and 252, which gave the commissioner discretion to revoke a license were not unconstitutionally vague when effective regulations, 31 Pa. Code &sect; 33.7(a) and (b), adequately clarified the Act's language. There was no abuse of discretion in revoking petitioner's licenses solely upon his criminal convictions. 31 Pa. Code &sect; 33.7(b). Finally, laches did not bar the revocation proceedings when no prejudice to petitioner was established by the three-year delay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that revoked petitioner licensee's insurance agent and broker licenses pursuant to the Insurance Department Act (Act). There was no improper commingling of functions between regulatory and adversarial, the Act was not unconstitutionally vague when clarified by regulations, laches did not bar the revocation proceedings, and there was no abuse of discretion in revoking petitioner's licenses.</SPAN></P>
