</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which issued an order for a preliminary injunction pending an award of an arbitration in an action brought by respondent firefighters union regarding a breach of a collective bargaining agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon concluding that orders issued by the fire chief violated the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, an arbitrator directed that scheduling for the year be conducted as it had been in the prior year. The circuit court affirmed this order and the city claimed that the arbitrator, in requiring the maintenance of past practice, awarded on a matter not submitted to him. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case for alteration of the arbitration award. The court dismissed the order issued pending the arbitrator's award because such award terminated the pending relief given by the circuit court. The court found that the arbitrator did not award upon a matter not submitted to him because the disagreement was as to the merits of the propriety of the maintenance of past practice, and not as to whether the issue itself was before the arbitrator. The court stated that the direction of the arbitrator was based upon his understanding of the wishes of the parties. However, the court found that the provision compelling the implementation of the past year's scheduling practices was contrary to a certain admonition in the labor agreement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the appeal in respect to the order issued pending the arbitrator's award.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action for a declaration that respondent City's rent withholding ordinance was unconstitutional, appellant lessor sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which upheld the constitutionality of the statute. The landlord contended that the ordinance conflicted with state and was preempted by state law and that it did not afford due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City had an ordinance that allowed lessees to withhold rent until building code violations were repaired, and the lessor sought a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the ordinance was a valid exercise of the City's power under Wis. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3, the state home rule amendment, because it was primarily and paramountly an enactment that was a matter of the local affairs and government and thus the doctrine of preemption did not apply. Furthermore, the ordinance did not conflict with Wis. Stat. &sect; 280.22 or Wis. Stat. Ch. 704. The ordinance afforded sufficient due process because it provided for notice, an impartial hearing with a right to appeal to the a circuit court, the right to be represented by counsel, and to present evidence. A tape recorded record was required and the Housing Code Enforcement and Appeals Board of the City could affirm, reverse or modify the authorization to withhold rent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner prisoner appealed an extradition order of the County Court of Brown County (Wisconsin), which was based on the approval by the Governor of Wisconsin of a request for his extradition by a demanding state under the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act (Act), Wis. Stat. &sect; 976.03. The prisoner challenged the constitutionality of the Act and further alleged that he was not a fugitive from justice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner argued that the Governor's extradition warrant describing him as a &quot;fugitive from justice&quot; was defective in that, when he left Illinois, the demanding state, he was in custody and was being brought to Wisconsin to complete a sentence. On appeal, the court pointed out that his first departure from Illinois, which predated the trip the prisoner made to return to serve his sentence, had been voluntary. Even based on his second departure he would still be subject to extradition. The court framed the prisoner's constitutional claim as whether there was a constitutional imperative that, because a waiting period and right to petition the Governor for an investigation was in the Uniform Detainer Act, it had to be in the Extradition Act to make that Act constitutionally antiseptic. The court held that the fact that a person subject to extradition proceedings was informed of his rights and given the opportunity to challenge the legality of his extradition at a judicial hearing immediately after a warrant was issued by the Governor was sufficient to meet constitutional requirements as to due process and equal protection. The Act was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which sustained the demurrer of defendant public officials for failure to state a cause of action in the taxpayers' action for a judgment declaring the statutory plan for the financing of the Milwaukee public schools, as set forth in Wis. Stat. &sect; 119.46, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers filed suit pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 269.56 (1973) and alleged that the statutes authorizing the assessment, levy, collection, and distribution of property taxes for the financing of the Milwaukee public schools violated their constitutional rights under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 9, 17; art. VIII, &sect; 1; and art. X, &sect;&sect; 2, 3, 4, 5. On appeal, the court held that the taxpayers' complaint was sufficient to withstand the officials' demurrer. The court reasoned that a demurrer to a complaint in a declaratory judgment action did not present the question of whether the complaint stated a cause of action, but rather whether the controversy was one that should be considered and heard on the merits. The court concluded that a justiciable controversy existed, that the parties' interests were adverse, that the taxpayers had a legally protected interest in the proceeding, and that the issues involved in the case were ripe for judicial determination. Accordingly, the trial court erred when it sustained the officials' demurrer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's order and remanded the action for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer was a foreign corporation with property located in the state. The department assessed an ad valorem tax on the property, and the taxpayer brought an action challenging the tax. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the department, and the taxpayer sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the assessment of the tax did not violate Due Process or the Commerce Clause. The taxpayer failed to meet its burden of showing that the tax was improperly assessed; therefore, the taxpayer was not entitled to argue that an unconstitutional multiple tax was imposed. Further, the department only taxed the portion of the taxpayer's nonmigratory property that was located in the state. Finally, the trial court properly adjusted the assessment under Wis.

The officers were instructed by the homeowner to wait in the den and not enter the living room.

Defendant argued that the officer was not entitled to be in the kitchen or to have seen what he did. The prosecution argued that the invitation into the home included the right to look around so any observations made was not a search. The court held that: (1) the extent of an invitation into someone's home depended upon the relationship of the parties and the particular circumstances of the visit; (2) the homeowner's conduct clearly showed that the officers were to stay in the den; (3) the officer's entry into the kitchen and his surveillance of the living room was a search for which there was no warrant; (4) the exceptions to the warrantless search rule did not apply; and (5) testimony that the officer saw drugs being removed while defendant was sitting nearby had to be suppressed but the drugs and the agents' testimony that they saw defendant as they entered the house did not have to be suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After an elected circuit court judge became ill, the judicial commission found that a temporary vacancy existed in that office due to the elected judge's physical or mental infirmity.

On review, the court rejected the petitioning attorney's contention that the appointment violated Wis. Stat. &sect; 17.026 or the Wisconsin Constitution. The judicial commission's and the Chief Justice's powers were triggered when the incumbent was unable to discharge his duties by reason of physical or mental infirmity. The appointment of the reserve judge was for the temporary performance of the duties of that office. There was no requirement that the office be vacated by the incumbent. The court found that, although elected judges were required to retire at age 70, it was the plain intent of the joint resolutions leading to a 1968 constitutional amendment that any judge or supreme court justice who had served eight years was eligible to be a reserve circuit judge, irrespective of age. Thus, the temporary appointment of the 73-year-old reserve judge was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, an enrolled Menominee Indian, claimed that Wisconsin state courts had no jurisdiction to try him for a crime committed off the reservation and not in Indian country, because neither the Tribe nor Congress had granted such power to the state. The court rejected defendant's contention, holding that the state had jurisdiction to try an Indian for an offense committed outside of the reservation boundaries but within the state, without resort to an interpretation of the various treaties between the federal government and the tribe, because the state had sovereignty over all lands located within its exterior boundaries. That sovereignty was subject only to the limiting authority of the United States government as expressed in the United States Constitution, and it arose upon the admission of the territory of Wisconsin to statehood in 1848, and resulted from the transfer of federal government sovereignty to the state. If the transfer to the state of jurisdiction over lands not comprising those left to the Indians, which occurred when Wisconsin was admitted to the Union, constituted an abrogation of any treaty right, such abrogation was well within the power of Congress.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court denied post-conviction relief under Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06. Writs of error were issued by the instant court to review the judgment of conviction and the order denying post-conviction relief. The court concluded that the evidence at the preliminary hearing was sufficient to bind defendant over for trial. It also concluded that Wis. Stat. &sect; 553.21(2) (1973) was not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Further, it concluded that defendant was not denied due process of law by the circuit court's refusal to grant a continuance to obtain private counsel. Moreover, the court held that the circuit trial court properly convicted defendant notwithstanding its failure to use the word &quot;guilty&quot; in its finding of a criminal violation. Finally, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction.

The circuit court sustained the findings. The court reversed. The court found the findings of fact were fatally deficient as to the finding that the allegation the sheriff received money from an inmate was not supported by evidence but did support a violation of the rules and regulations. The finding did not indicate what evidence substantiated violations of the rules and regulations and failed to state what rules and regulations were violated; to the extent that finding was supported, it referred to misconduct not charged.

Defendant had been sentenced in accordance with the mandatory provision of Wis.

The court held that it was within the province of the legislature as to what punishment was to be related to a particular crime and that courts had no inherent power to stay or suspend execution of a sentence absent statutory authority. The court concluded that the independent exercise of discretion by the courts was not unconstitutionally impaired because discretion could be exercised within the mandated limits. Additionally, the constitution did not prohibit the legislature from constricting, in the public interest, the independent exercise of judicial discretion by prescribing mandatory minimum sentences. In affirming, the court held that the mandatory sentencing provision of &sect; 343.44(2) did not deny equal protection because its purpose was to decrease car accidents by imposing fair penalty on those who were most likely to cause the accidents.</SPAN></P>

However, the inmate was convicted of violating a state law. It was undisputed that the inmate was not advised of his right to counsel and that, if he were indigent, one would be appointed. The inmate was sentenced to jail and filed a writ of habeas corpus. The court granted the writ, holding that, to insure the fair administration of justice, whenever a defendant was charged with a crime, the penalty for which included the requirement or option of incarceration, he must be advised of his right to counsel and further advised that, if he were indigent, that counsel would be furnished to him at public expense unless he knowingly and intelligently waived such right. The court further held that the inmate's conviction for violating Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.44(1) was improper because he was merely charged with violating of a county ordinance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Noting that nonresident shareholders ordinarily paid no personal income tax to the state, the court explained that the classification adopted by the statute was related directly to the incidence of personal taxation upon the shareholders. The classification was based upon a real and not an arbitrary or capricious difference, and did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The court pointed out that the impact of the tax fell more heavily upon Wisconsin residents, for they were obliged not only to have their distributive shares reduced by the tax on the corporation's gain apportioned to out-of-state residents, but, in addition, they were taxed on their personal distributions. The court concluded that the tax was designed to make the treatment of resident and nonresident more equitable. The court noted that interstate commerce could have been required to pay its way, a result commonly reached by allocating to the taxing state business derived from operations within the state. The court added that a corporation, though a legal entity, was not a citizen for purposes of the Privileges and Immunities Clause and could not have claimed its protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">According to testimony adduced at trial defendant, a divorcee, moved into an apartment inside the victim's house as a private duty nurse; the victim also was divorced. The victim then bought defendant a car which was to be used in the operation of a commercial convalescent home, which was to be located in the victim's house. The victim executed a power of attorney giving defendant control over the victim's affairs and executed a will that left his entire estate to defendant. The victim's sons, with the victim's acquiescence, initiated action to recover the victim's property and control his affairs. One evening, defendant told neighbors that the victim had been shot and to call the police. The trial court interpreted defendant's request as permission for the search that produced incriminating evidence. The court concluded that the search of defendant's bedroom was unconstitutional and that the gun case and box of shells obtained therefrom should have been excluded. However, the admission of that evidence constituted harmless error because evidence adduced without the gun case and shells enabled the jury to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city annexed certain lands in the town. The annexation was commenced at the behest of two property owners who filed a petition with the city to annex the lands, and who also sought to rezone most of the proposed annexation for industrial use. After the city approved the annexation petition, the town filed a complaint for declaratory judgment. The town sought a declaration that the annexation was invalid because it purportedly violated the rule of reason, which was used to test the validity of municipal annexations. After a trial, the circuit court upheld that validity of the annexation. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the town did not sustain its burden of proving that no reasonable need for the annexation existed. The court found that the town's statement that the sole purpose behind the annexation was to obtain a change in zoning was misleading and, further found that a purpose to develop one's land was legitimate for purposes of annexation. The court concluded that the city demonstrated that there existed a reasonable need for land with potential for industrial development.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the court held that the trial court had authority and properly reinstated the charge. The court then held that supplemental instructions the trial court provided concerning aiding and abetting elements of the shooting constituted harmless error because the result of the trial would not have been different if the improper portion of the instruction had not been given. The court also held that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions on both counts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant owners opposed the condemnation of their property and contested the memorandum decision, judgements, and orders of the trial court in favor of respondent power company. On appeal, the court found that the power company sought condemnation of the property to achieve its public purpose of constructing two nuclear power plants. The record showed that the power company had already spent millions of dollars on the project, and there was no real evidence that it lacked the commitment to complete the project. The evidence in the record amply supported the conclusion that a public use, construction of nuclear power plants, for the lands was reasonably assured and that condemnation of the property was reasonably necessary. Although the need for the second reactor was indefinite at the time of the condemnation, the court determined that the power company's long-term planning and condemning on the basis of a two-reactor facility was not a gross abuse of discretion. The trial court found that for safety reasons the power company needed complete control over the exclusion area, and that a fee interest was therefore appropriate. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a town and its officials, citing Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 23, sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin) in favor of respondent State of Wisconsin on behalf of relator citizens, declaring a town election null and void and awarding a preemptory writ of mandamus to require the holding of a special election to increase the number of supervisors from three to five under Wis. Stat. &sect; 60.19(1)(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The increase was approved at a town meeting. The town and officials contended on appeal that Wis. Stat. &sect; 60.19(1)(c) violated the uniformity provisions of Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 23, that the action of the electors at the town meeting was a conditional direction to the board of supervisors to increase its membership from three to five members, and that if an increase was required, the members should be elected to staggered terms. The court affirmed the judgment. The court concluded that the town and officials had not carried the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 60.19(1)(c). The court declared it to be a constitutional enactment. The court found that the clear import of the meeting minutes indicated that the motion was passed and questions of legality only arose after passage, that the evidence fully supported the holding of the trial court, and that because the duty of the board was clear, mandamus was the proper remedy. The court determined that since &sect; 60.19(1)(c) required election at large of all five members and did not provide for staggered terms on election, all five members should be elected at one election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court declaring the town's election void and granting a writ of mandamus to the citizens to require the town and officials to hold a special election to elect a board of supervisors consisting of five rather than three members.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of various pandering and prostitution-related offenses.

The court determined that Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.32 was not an included offense under Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.34(2), which prohibited granting use as a place of prostitution, because the crime did not have the necessary common elements as did a crime of soliciting a prostitute under Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.32. The court held that defendant's conviction for soliciting a prostitute was not a violation of his right of free speech because it was constitutional to make promotion of unlawful chain distributor schemes a crime, so recruiting partners for illegal acts could be prohibited also. Defendant's conviction under Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.34(2) was proper because he clearly had possession and control over the apartment, which was a place of prostitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was on probation for enticing a child for immoral purposes when he was accused of fondling and kissing the 11-year-old. Defendant's probation agent told him to go to the police station. At the station, defendant's photograph was taken. The 11-year-old identified him in a photographic line-up. Defendant was found guilty by the jury. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant's required appearance at the police station was not an unconstitutional seizure of his person. A less stringent standard for determining whether defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were violated was appropriate because of the nature of probation. The probation agent made a reasonable effort to determine if defendant had complied with his probation conditions. The seizure was only for a short time and only for the purpose of identification. The photograph of defendant taken at the police station was obtained legally and was a seizure of evidence that defendant regularly exposed to the public. The photographing was constitutional because it was reasonable under the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The pilot was engaged in the business of aerial application of chemicals to agricultural crops. The state conservation warden found a number of empty pesticide containers, uncovered and in a pile on the ground. The court affirmed the decision, finding that &sect; AG 29.12(6) was sufficiently definite to pass constitutional muster. The rule spoke of holding of pesticides for disposal, and not merely disposal itself, and was clear that one may violate the rule by failing to adequately protect persons and wildlife from exposure to pesticides. Thus, the rule was not unconstitutionally vague. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict. The pesticides involved were toxic and dangerous to human and animal life. One substance could under some circumstances cause death by skin contact alone. The containers were not enclosed, protected, or covered in any manner. There was no physical impediment to access to the containers by persons or animals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a hearing on an order directed by the court (Wisconsin) to a county court judge to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for failure to file a complete report concerning his failure to comply with the provisions of Rule 17 of the Code of Judicial Ethics and after a full hearing before the Judicial Commission (Wisconsin), which found that the judge had violated Rule 17, the court considered certain issues raised by the judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judge filed a financial report providing all information required by Rule 17 except that he refused to disclose his assets. The court noted that he cited no authority in support of the proposition that sincerity was relevant in determining whether a contempt had been committed by refusing to comply with a court rule or order. The general rule was to the contrary. Constitutional arguments he raised had already been decided against him in a proceeding regarding his failure to file a report of his assets the year before. In response to the judge's argument that a contempt sanction would be in effect a removal or suspension from office, the court pointed out that sanctions short of removal were not barred when the exclusive power of removal was vested elsewhere. The court's order to show cause why he should not be held in contempt was more than sufficient to comply with due process requirements. Violation of the show cause order itself was grounds for contempt. The order was specific and was adopted by another order of the court. The court had the authority, under its superintending and inherent power, to adopt the Code of Judicial Ethics, with contempt available to enforce it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held the judge in contempt and ordered that, if he did not comply with the Rule within 20 days of the date of the decision, he be fined $ 150 and that he be fined an additional $ 50 for each day thereafter that he failed to comply. Collection of the fine was to be accomplished by the Secretary of the Department of Administration (Wisconsin) deducting any unpaid fines from the salary paid to the judge from a statutory appropriation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a class action against the state brought on behalf of all property taxpayers residing in negative-aid school districts and on behalf of all such school districts themselves, petitioners were granted leave to commence an original action for declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 121.07, 121.08, containing a scheme intended to equalize school funding across the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners challenged a school funding scheme under &sect;&sect; 121.08, 121.08 that was intended to achieve equalization of taxing power among the school districts of Wisconsin. Although the school districts had no standing to challenge the scheme, the taxpayers did. The effect of the statutes was that the so-called negative-aid districts were required to pay a portion of their property tax revenues into the general state fund to be redistributed to other school districts in the state, which the court determined to be a state levy. However, the revenues from which the negative-aid funds were derived were raised by local property taxes, not state taxes. The statutory scheme vested the power of property taxation in local districts, and the taxes which they imposed pursuant to that power were local taxes to be distributed locally, not state taxes to be distributed across the state. The court concluded that the state could not compel one school district to levy and collect a tax for the direct benefit of other school districts, or for the sole benefit of the state. Thus the statutes under consideration were violative of the rule of uniform taxation set forth in Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petitioner challenged, by habeas corpus, the continuing nature of his involuntary commitment as a sex offender under the Wisconsin Sex Crimes Act, Wis. Stat. &sect; 975. The trial court held that habeas corpus was not available to a person committed under &sect; 975. The trial court found that the statute was only applicable to civil commitments and that whereas the petitioner was committed in a criminal proceeding, only the committing court could conduct judicial review. On appeal, the court held that the right to have habeas corpus could not be denied to a petitioner who inquired into the legal authority for his detention. The court found that the present procedures failed to afford due process by not providing the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time in a meaningful way. The court found that petitioner was entitled to a hearing affording the same minimal requirements of due process. The court however, rejected petitioner's contention that the disparity in his rights of judicial examination constituted a violation of equal protection rights, finding that there was a rational basis justifying the disparity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The partnership was the general partner of a Texas corporation licensed in Wisconsin whose entire stock was owned by nonresident aliens, citizens of West Germany. The corporation stood to bear a loss of forfeiture because the exercise of its options to purchase land in the state would place its ownership above the limit set forth in &sect; 710.02. The corporation argued that as a limited partnership it was not covered by &sect; 710.02 as it only referred to individuals, corporations, and associations. The question before the court was whether nonresident aliens had the same rights as resident aliens with respect to the purchase of real property. The court affirmed that &sect; 710.02 was constitutional and applicable to the partnership. The court held that (1) the term associations included limited partnerships and applied to the partnership; (2) there was no provision in the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, 7 U.S.T. 1839 (1956), giving nonresident nationals of West Germany the right to purchase and hold land contrary to existing state law; and (3) &sect; 710.02 did not violate the equal protection clause of Wis.

Defendant had consented to the order that required him to not falsely represent to a customer that appliance he sold were free of defects or were in good working order or condition and functioning properly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sold a stove with burners dysfunctional by charred and cut wires and a refrigerator that ran constantly and remained in a freeze cycle. Defendant argued, inter alia, that oral warranties made by him to the customer were not part of the transaction between them and should have been excluded under the parol evidence rule. On appeal, the court disagreed. One of the exceptions to the parol evidence rule was fraud, and the evidence of fraudulent misrepresentation was admissible, not to contradict the written terms of the agreement, but rather to demonstrate that it was invalid as induced by fraud. Moreover, the consent order banned both written and oral false representations, and defendant could not escape responsibility by reliance on the limited terms of a written guaranty given to the customer. Defendant waived the right to challenge the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. 100.20(3), upon which the order was based, because he did not challenge it when he agreed to the order in exchange for not being prosecuted at that time. Defendant's claim that he did not know the appliances were defective was rejected because the order applied to any goods that were in fact defective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant was convicted for soliciting contributions without prior registration and using names without authorization when soliciting contributions. The funds were allegedly solicited from the public for charitable purposes. The court affirmed all counts of conviction except those counts that resulted in multiplicity, which the court reversed. The general purpose of Wis. Stat. &sect; 440.41 was to insure that funds solicited from the public for charitable purposes were not diverted to other uses. It logically followed, the court wrote, that the crime of unauthorized use of names was directed at protecting the public against being misled and not protecting the person whose name was used, which did not require that liability for the crime be imposed for each individual person whose name was used, particularly where, the unauthorized uses were simultaneously committed. The court also held that: (1) the trial court did not lack personal jurisdiction because of improper venue; (2) the complaint was sufficient; (3) the evidence at trial was sufficient to sustain the convictions; and (4) the penalty provisions of &sect; 440.41(10)(c) were applicable to violations of any part of &sect; 440.41.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 161.41(1m) with possession of marijuana and heroin with intent to deliver were sufficient, and that &sect; 161.41(1m) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A confidential informant provided the police with an affidavit stating that he had purchased heroin from defendants at their residence. A police officer believed that the informant was reliable because he was an eyewitness and because he made the statement contrary to his penal interests. Thereafter, the police officer obtained a search warrant for defendants' residence, which they rented as tenants. During the search, the police found a large amount of money and marijuana. As such, complaints were issued against both defendants for violating &sect; 161.41(1m). The court held that the search warrant was valid because the confidential informant's affidavit was reliable in that the informant admitted to buying heroin against his penal interest, thereby establishing his credibility. The court further held that the complaints were sufficient for the magistrate to find probable cause that the crimes charged were committed by defendants. Additionally, the court found that &sect; 161.41(1m) was constitutional, that it was not vague, and that it did not create an unconstitutional presumption as to what amount of a controlled substance had to be possessed to infer intent.</SPAN></P>

In view of the nature of the offense and the relevant factors considered by the trial court, the court further held that there was no abuse of sentencing discretion. The court also held that the modification of the proscribed conduct identified by the noun &quot;maltreatment&quot; by the adjective &quot;cruel&quot; did not import &quot;malice&quot; into the statute as a required element of the crime, that defendant's challenge to the jury instructions was unfounded, that defendant was not immune from criminal prosecution for conduct that was statutorily prohibited based on generalized assertions that his conduct was undertaken in good faith, and that a search warrant was not tainted by a constitutionally illegal search.</SPAN></P>

Circuit court overruled defendants' demurrer, which argued that plaintiffs lacked standing to sue for treble damages under &sect; 133.01, plaintiffs improperly united several claims, and statute of limitations bar. Trial court deferred ruling on constitutionality of &sect; 133.23 remedy provisions. Defendants sought review. Court affirmed, holding that, by law, plaintiffs were &quot;persons&quot; and therefore had standing to sue for treble damages under &sect; 133.01. Plaintiffs' complaint was not demurrable because only one cause of action was pleaded, despite the prayer for different forms of relief under different sections of the statutes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Shortly before his death, the victim indicated that a man in the bathroom of the bar had shot him. Defendant exited the bathroom right after the shooting. A search of defendant's home revealed a gun and bullets similar to those found at the scene. On appeal, the court found that the circumstantial evidence that defendant shot the victim was overwhelming. Defendant's intent was presumed because the victim was shot in the heart, which is a vital organ. The court noted that although there was some evidence that defendant was intoxicated at the time, thereby raising the question of whether he possessed the requisite intent to kill, there was also considerable evidence, on which the jury apparently relied, that defendant was capable of intending to kill defendant. There was testimony that defendant did not appear intoxicated and that he walked and spoke normally following the shooting. Instructions of certain lesser-included offenses of first-degree murder were properly denied because there was no reasonable ground for a conviction on such offenses. A continuance based on pretrial publicity was not warranted because voir dire questioning was extensive and revealed no prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The clerk was removed from office by the council. The clerk appealed to the trial court by writ of certiorari. The trial court quashed the writ. The court affirmed and held that the investigatory and adjudicatory functions were not so intermingled in the removal proceedings that the clerk was denied due process. The clerk's employment status constituted a property right and was afforded due-process protections; however, those protections were not violated. He was given timely and adequate notice of the reasons for the discharge, an impartial decisionmaker, and the opportunity to confront and cross examine witnesses. Members of the council were not disqualified merely because they had initiated the hearing and investigation, and an ex parte investigation did not per se violate the right to constitutional due process. The mere fact that the alderman filed the charges did not disqualify him from sitting as an impartial adjudicator; a member of a board could initiate charges, make an investigation, and sit on the adjudicatory board unless there was evidence to show that the adjudicator was so psychologically wedded to the complaint that he could not fairly decide the matter.</SPAN></P>

The court modified the trial court's order by allowing the testimony of the undercover officer.

His testimony would be independent of the use of the device and would have been the same even if the device were not used or had mechanically failed.

Because of conduct that the parole authorities determined to be sufficient for revocation, petitioner was returned to Wisconsin, his parole was revoked, and he was required to complete his sentence. Petitioner argued that he was deprived of his constitutional rights, because the Act under which he was permitted to work in Minnesota, denied him the right to an extradition hearing prior to his return to Wisconsin. He also contended that the procedure adopted by the State in the pickup of compact parolees denied him equal protection of the laws, because a parolee who absconded from the state was entitled to an extradition hearing, while one who left the state with permission was denied that right. The court concluded that the Act was not unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, who had formerly been convicted of selling marijuana for smoking purposes but had been discharged from custody, probation supervision, and further sanctions, disputed an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which denied his motion for postconviction relief brought pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06 to set aside his conviction. The main issue was whether the trial court had jurisdiction to consider the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant argued that the jurisdictional requirement was met because he alleged that he was confined in a county jail and that the conviction in the state court was the basis for a federal detainer and possible deportation proceedings. Appellant relied on cases decided under the federal postconviction statute,&nbsp;28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2255, of which &sect; 974.06 was almost a carbon copy. On appeal, the court agreed with appellant that the custody requirement should be interpreted with liberality but concluded that federal cases discussing the custody requirements under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2241, 2255 supported the State's position that the court lacked jurisdiction. He was being held in custody not under sentence of a court, Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06(1); his custody was the result of a separate process beyond the control of the State. Appellant's case was not moot and that his sentence had been completely served would not necessarily preclude a challenge to the conviction under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2241, 2255, but the federal cases showed that defendants were allowed to attack sentences already served only where they were currently serving a sentence that was directly affected by the prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

A federal court invoked the abstention doctrine on this issue pending resolution of &sect; 36.16. Upon dismissal by the trial court on the grounds of state sovereign immunity under Wis. Stat. &sect; 285.01, the court affirmed, holding that: 1) the students' claim was a suit against the state, which was subject to the defense of sovereign immunity, and the board had no authority to waive the defense; 2) because the defense was sufficiently raised, the trial court had no personal jurisdiction over the matter; 3) the parties proceeded upon the assumption that the registrar raised an immunity defense, and there was no allegations of malicious misconduct; therefore, his conduct fell within the scope of immunity; and 4) because Wis. Stat. &sect; 36.16 was repealed and re-enacted with changes, the action for declaratory relief based upon that statute was not a justiciable controversy ripe for determination under Wis.

Stat. &sect; 161.555 (1973). The State also filed a motion to strike certain portions of respondent's brief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State commenced a forfeiture action of an automobile belonging to respondent that had been seized by the police pursuant to &sect; 161.555. Under &sect; 161.555(2), the district attorney was required to institute forfeiture proceedings within 15 days of the seizure and a hearing on the matter had to be set within 60 days of the service of the answer. Because the hearing on the action had not been set within the 60-day time period, the trial court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action. The court upheld the trial court's order. The court held that the interest of the State and the public in controlling the drug traffic that forfeiture actions were designed to protect was adequately served by the initial seizure. The interests of the possibly innocent owner should likewise be protected by strict compliance with the procedural mandate of &sect; 161.555. The court concluded that the provisions of &sect; 161.555(2) were mandatory and that the failure to set the hearing within 60 days deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to hear the matter. Finally, respondent's request for a postponement of the hearing could not be considered a waiver of a jurisdictional defect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, a lecturer and others similarly situated, filed an original action for a judgment declaring Wis.

Respondents, the attorney general and others, argued in opposition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners filed the action after a federal district court abstained from ruling on the constitutionality of &sect; 450.11 (2) and directed them to bring an action in state court. The federal district court declared that &sect; 450.11(2) was susceptible of a reasonable and narrow construction covering only commercial exhibitions and displays of contraception and abortion devices; thus, &sect; 450.11(2) would not have applied to petitioners, who allegedly sought to deliver and to observe a free public lecture involving the exhibition and display of contraception and abortion devices. The court agreed. The First Amendment protected peaceful displays intended to communicate ideas even though such displays were not &quot;pure speech.&quot; The displays in the case were protected because they were intimately linked as visual aids to the obviously protected verbal expression of the lecturer. The court construed &sect; 450.11(2) to proscribe only purely commercial exhibitions or displays of contraception and abortion devices for sale purposes. It did not reach the questions of the constitutionality of &sect; 450.11 as narrowly construed or whether petitioners had standing to challenge &sect; 450.11(2) as narrowly construed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court construed the statutory language to proscribe only purely commercial exhibitions or displays of contraception and abortion devices for the purpose of sale.

Defendant was convicted of placing drugs in a public place under Wis. Stat. &sect; 450.09. Defendant claimed on appeal that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it did not define the conduct that was proscribed with sufficient certainty. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that defendant had notice from the language of the statute that his conduct was within the statutory prohibition. The statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad because it did not require a potential offender to guess as to whether the circumstances authorized him to place the drugs where he did. The words &quot;drug, medicine or chemical, or any compound or combination thereof&quot; were to be construed under a reasonable construction consistent with the legislative intent. The difference between a public and private place was not vague.

The court held that it was bound by the departments factual finding that the employee had demonstrated his ability to bend and move about with his hair sealed under his protective helmet. The court found that because there was alternative means of protection available, the employer's inflexible hair length requirements were not reasonable. Thus, because the grooming code was not necessary for safety in the form promulgated, refusal to comply was not misconduct that was wilful or wanton disregard of an employer's interests.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's decision on demurrer was that the riparian owners had not exhausted their administrative remedies by applying for a permit to irrigate under Wis. Stat. &sect; 30.18. On appeal, the court noted that the only effect of a trout stream designation was to require the written approval of the Department before an otherwise mandatory permit could be granted to divert surplus waters. Because there was no allegation in the complaint that the waters to be diverted were surplus waters, the question of whether designation of water as a trout stream required prior notice and hearing was not before the court. Plaintiffs had no means of securing a permit for the irrigation they contemplated because irrigation was prohibited by Wis. Stat. &sect; 30.18(3) without a permit, and the Department lacked the power to grant a permit over objections of other riparian proprietors. The action for declaratory judgment was not prematurely brought, and it was not proper to dismiss the complaint. A judgment should have been entered declaring that plaintiffs had no right of irrigation as riparian proprietors and that &sect; 30.18 was not unconstitutional in failing to provide a hearing to adjudicate that right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's order was modified to include a provision that it had the effect of a judgment declaring that plaintiffs had no right of irrigation as riparian proprietors. It was also adjudicated that the statutory provision for designation of water as a trout stream were not unconstitutional in failing to provide a hearing to adjudicate the right of irrigation. As modified, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Wisconsin Judicial Commission held an executive session for the sole purpose of considering complaints and investigations in a disciplinary matter involving a judge. A county attorney sought a declaration whether the Open Meetings Law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.77, was applicable to the Commission. The court determined that the rules of the Commission included directives relating to open meetings. The court found that the rules essentially provided that following an investigation and a determination by the Commission, all proceedings of the Commission from then on were public. The court concluded, therefore, that the adoption of the Judicial Commission Rules of Procedure preempted any attempt to apply &sect; 66.77 to the proceedings of the Commission. The court found that its determination did no violence to the public policy expressed by the legislative enactment of &sect; 66.77 because the rules of the Commission were at least as expansive as those contained in &sect; 66.77. Further, the court determined that even if &sect; 66.77 was applicable to certain proceedings of the Commission, those proceedings were exempt under exceptions contained in Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.77(4).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The holders' complaint alleged that Wis.

The trial court found that the holders lacked standing to sue and dismissed their action against defendants. The holders appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that while there may have been a logical link between the holders' status as liquor license holders and the subject matter of the challenged statute, the individual substantive allegations of the holders' complaint did not show a nexus between that status and the constitutional infringements alleged. The court determined that the holders were neither denied due process nor equal protection by &sect; 176.05(21)(h) because they already held Class &quot;B&quot; liquor licenses and the procedure utilized in the issuance of new Class &quot;B&quot; liquor licenses did not affect theirs. The court concluded that &sect; 176.05(21)(h) was a reasonable enactment based on the state's broad police power over the liquor industry and found that the holders failed to assume or to meet their burden of proving that &sect; 176.05(21)(h) was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state legislature passed an act, 1973 Wis.

The secretary refused based on advice that several provisions of the act were unconstitutional. The recycling authority filed an action for declaratory judgment and sought a declaration that the entire statute was constitutional and also sought an injunctive order which would direct the secretary to honor its request for the funds. The court declared that the act was constitutional and issued the injunctive order. The court held that in view of the nature and provisions of the act, its implementation would be for the public health, welfare, safety, and comfort of the people of the entire state and, therefore, met the constitutional requirement that the expenditures be for public and statewide purposes only.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Judicial Commission (Wisconsin) made a finding that petitioner, a state court judge, had not filed a complete financial report in violation of Wis. Judicial Code of Ethics R.17. The court ordered the judge to show cause why he should not be held in contempt. After the judge continued to refuse to comply, the court sought to determine the validity of Rule 17 and to determine appropriate discipline.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judge filed his financial report with the court and completed all items, with the exception of the item calling for disclosure of assets. The judge contended that the item calling for disclosure of assets was unconstitutional. The court disagreed finding that it had the power to adopt and enforce the Code of Judicial Ethics and Rule 17 as a result of its inherent and implied power as the supreme court. The adoption of the code and the adoption of Rule 17 were actions of the court performed in carrying out the function of superintending control as expressly set forth in Wis. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3. Enforcement of the code was aimed at insuring that, when a judge acted judicially, he acted impartially and ethically. In addition, the court held that Wis. Judicial Code of Ethics R. 17 was a reasonable additional regulation promulgated by the court as a response to the compelling need to maintain public confidence in the judiciary. Rule 17 was not an unconstitutionally overbroad intrusion into the judge's economic affairs. As a public official, the judge had voluntarily subjected himself to more scrutiny than a purely private individual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined that the rule requiring financial disclosure of the judge's assets was valid and ordered that the judge comply with the provisions of the rule within 20 days of the court's order. The court reserved jurisdiction of the proceedings pending further order of the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner contended that the prohibition without use permit of his skeet-shooting range was a violation of his constitutional rights.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the property owner's conditional use permit should be voided. The court found the property owner's constitutional claims to be without merit as the operation of his commercial enterprise was not, vague, overbroad or within the scope of the First Amendment. Because the amended ordinance required a description of the property and other information as the town board deemed necessary to establish the applicant's need and intent for a conditional use, the guidelines or criteria for issuance of a conditional use permit were adequate. The property owner was told, before the amendment was passed, that his commercial enterprise was not in compliance with the zoning ordinance. That the town board did not proceed against when he first began operating the range did not bar it from later enforcing the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The town filed an action for declaratory judgment, challenging an ordinance adopted by city that annexed, pursuant to Wis.

The town contended that the &quot;rule of reason,&quot; requiring that an annexation be reasonable to be valid, applied and that the action of the city council was arbitrary, unreasonable and capricious, not meeting the &quot;rule of reason&quot; test. The city contended that the &quot;rule of reason&quot; test did not apply, and the trial court agreed. On appeal, the court vacated with directions to dismiss the town's complaint without prejudice. The court found that both the contention of the town that the city's action violated the &quot;rule of reason,&quot; and the city's contention that such rule was not applicable, raised an issue of constitutional dimension. The court then found that where there was an allegation challenging the constitutionality of a city ordinance, the state attorney general had to be served with copies of the proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The seller warranted title when it sold the vehicle to the buyer. The trial court granted damages to the buyer. On appeal, the seller argued that the warranty of title upon the certificate of title was not intended to provide a guarantee to a buyer. The court affirmed, stating that it was difficult to understand why the warranty would run to everyone but the buyer, in whose presence the signature of affirmation presumably occurred and who was listed as the beneficiary of the warranty on the certificate. The court concluded that a full warranty of good title was intended. The court held that the award of summary judgment to the buyer was consistent with the application of the statutorily demanded warranty accompanying the vehicle transfer. The court determined the buyer did not waive the warranty although he claimed he had a way to check the validity of the title. Finally, the court affirmed the amount of damages awarded by the trial court, holding that because the seller tried to show that the market value was higher by imprecise assertions, and since the buyer did not dispute the award, no reason existed for returning the action for a hearing as to a possibly higher market value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city adopted seven separate ordinances, each of which annexed a town island. The annexation proceeding was instituted pursuant to the provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.021(15) (1973), and the town filed suit, challenging the annexation. The trial court held that the town did not have the capacity to raise constitutional issues challenging &sect; 66.021(15) and that the city's annexation was invalid because it was done by seven separate ordinances, rather than by just one. Both parties appealed, claiming that the trial court erred. The court held that the town did not have the capacity to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. The court also stated that &sect; 66.021(15) was clear and unambiguous on its face and that it required that all the town islands had to be annexed by a single ordinance. The court concluded that the statute could not be construed to permit the annexation of seven town islands by seven separate annexation ordinances. The court upheld the trial court's ruling and denied the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant received a speeding citation. The county court denied her demurrer and motion to quash. She was also denied a jury trial. The circuit court denied her writ of prohibition. The court affirmed on appeal. The court found that defendant would not suffer grave hardship if the writ was not issued. The court further found that defendant had an adequate remedy in appeal. The court thus concluded that defendant failed to meet the necessary preconditions for the issuance of the writ. The court further found that the county court had jurisdiction because the servicing of the citation was sufficient process to confer personal jurisdiction over defendant. The court further found that defendant was not deprived of her right to a jury trial because she failed to meet the requirements of Wis. Stat. &sect; 299.21(3), by failing to file for a jury trial within the required 21 days. Once defendant lost her right under &sect; 299.21(3), it was up to the county clerk's discretion to grant her a jury trial. The court found it was not an abuse of discretion for the county court to fail to extend the 21-day time period especially because it was just a traffic ticket case.</SPAN></P>

The tortfeasors filed a demurrer to the complaint. The trial court overruled the demurrer. The court reversed the trial court's order. The court held that, standing alone, Wis.

The court further held that &sect; 895.04(4) did not deny equal protection and was constitutional. The distinction drawn by the legislature, as to who was entitled to recover pecuniary damages in a wrongful death action was rational and reasonable. There was an obvious and substantial difference between the classes in questions, as unemancipated minors and dependent adults relied more heavily on their parents for support than did emancipated minors or nondependent adults. Moreover, the distinction was consistent with the legislative purpose of limiting recovery for wrongful death to persons with a demonstrably close relationship with the deceased.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Acting Administrator of the Wisconsin Division of Corrections, sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 53.11(7)(b) was unconstitutional as violative of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses because it made a distinction without rational basis between mandatory and discretionary parole violators in the post-violation extension of the period of incarceration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Department raised two issues in its appeal of the trial court's decision: 1. Whether Wis. Stat. &sect; 53.11(7)(b) violated constitutional due process requirements; and 2. Whether &sect; 53.11(7)(b) violated constitutional equal protection requirements. The court noted that under &sect; 53.11(7), a mandatory parolee whose parole was revoked did not receive the same due process rights as those afforded a discretionary parolee whose parole was revoked. The court held that the same procedures afforded a discretionary parolee should be afforded to a mandatory parolee. Regarding the equal protection issue, the court noted that challenged legislative classification required only that the reviewing court locate some reasonable basis for the classification. However, the court held that there was no rational basis to justify a distinction which permitted discretionary parolees to have various factors taken into consideration in determining the extension of their period of incarceration after parole was revoked while allowing no such discretion for mandatory parolees. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that &sect; 53.11(7)(b) violated constitutional due process and equal protection requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature enacted Wis. Stat. &sect; 97.48 (4), which prohibited the sale or serving of nondairy creamers in restaurants or public eating establishments.

The trial court entered a permanent injunction. The court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 97.48 (4) was unconstitutional because the burden it imposed on interstate commerce was excessive in relation to any local benefits. The court first held that its stated purpose, to prevent consumer deception, was valid and the law was not just an attempt to protect the state's dairy industry. The law also did not violate due process because the means selected was rationally related to a legitimate end. The law was not trying to entirely outlaw nondairy creamers, but only outlaw them in places where people might not know they were ingesting them. But it did constitute an excessive burden on interstate commerce because there was considerable commerce that was impacted by the law and there were other ways of preventing consumer deception such as labeling or conspicuous notices.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Wood County (Wisconsin) issued a temporary injunction and an order holding the union and the teachers in contempt of the injunction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The teachers went on strike after collective bargaining negotiations between the union and the school district broke down. Despite the trial court's issuance of an injunction, the teachers continued the strike. The trial court thus held the union and the teachers in contempt.

He was sentenced to four years for the conviction resulting from the jury trial and a total of four years for the remaining eight counts to which he pled guilty. Defendant claimed he was entitled to credit for four days spent in custody prior to his transfer to prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was initially charged with three counts of burglary. Defendant pled not guilty and was convicted at a jury trial. Defendant was subsequently charged with 11 more counts of burglary, to which he pled guilty. At sentencing, the judge stated that although defendant was entitled to a jury trial, the judge had &quot;the right to also consider that whether or not this person really wanted to cooperate.&quot; The trial court imposed a total sentence of eight years. The court held that defendant was not improperly penalized for asserting his right to a jury trial. The court explained that the offhand comment by the judge indicated that defendant's claim that he had cooperated was not supported by the evidence. The court stated that the higher sentence was justified by other factors. The court further held that the four-day delay was not required to be credited under Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.15(1) because it was not unreasonable. The court concluded that although &sect; 973.15(1) was not unconstitutional, the legislature should consider amending the statute to be consistent with federal procedure and to avoid future questions of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant unions appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which had overruled their demurrer to the complaint brought by plaintiff employees that challenged the constitutionality of that portion of the Municipal Employment Relations Act that required non-union members to pay their proportionate share of the cost of the collective bargaining process and contract administration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The named employees were not union members, but under that &quot;fair-share agreement,&quot; a sum was deducted from their wages in an amount equal to that required of union members. They sought to have that deduction from their wages declared unconstitutional and a general declaration that statutes authorizing &quot;fair-share agreements&quot; were unconstitutional. The court affirmed the order that overruled the unions' demurrer. The court held that the subject matter of the action was not exclusively in the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC), that the administrative remedy of referendum was irrelevant to the issue raised here, and accordingly it properly exercised its function under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction when it concluded that the court had jurisdiction and that the ends of justice were best served by proceeding with the action. The court stated that although the issues in this case were within the concurrent jurisdiction of the WERC, it was mindful of WERC's manifest reluctance to exercise its jurisdiction to issue declaratory judgments on constitutional issues and that it had stated, as a matter of policy, such issues should have been brought to the courts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The teacher's association filed a complaint with the commission alleging that the school board committed a prohibited labor practice by negotiating with someone other than the teacher's association.

The court held a public school board meeting was part of the negotiation process where an impasse had been reached with the majority union and its representative addressed the board on subjects of the collective bargaining negotiations. The court found the activities of the board at the public meeting in which it listened to teachers who were not members of the teacher's association for the purpose of discussing a fair-share proposal constituted bargaining where the teachers were permitted to influence the decision of the school board by their arguments. The court determined the teachers who spoke at the meeting did more than just make a mere statement of position but rather they made an argument for it and that the teachers were members of an ad hoc group which was opposed to including a fire-share agreement in any contract being negotiated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state filed a complaint against defendant for escaping from an institution in violation of Wis.

The trial court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that the hospital had never under any circumstances met the conditions that required reimbursing the county for any of their alleged escapes. The State appealed, claiming that the trial court erred. The court held that even though the complaint incorrectly had the incorrect statute number in the information, it was just a typographical error and the appropriate judicial response to the error in the information was for the trial court to order an amendment curing the defect when it was called to the trial court's attention. The court also stated that Wis. Stat. &sect; 946.42(3)(d), which prohibited escape, did not deny equal protection of the law because there was a rational basis for punishing escapees from criminal commitment under Wis. Stat. &sect; 975, while not similarly punishing those who escape from civil commitment. Finally, the court concluded that the trial court was not entitled to dismiss the information on the ground of public policy because the failure of the hospital to pay the county was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute, which prohibited intercourse between males and minor females but not between females and minor males, was constitutional under the rational-basis test and did not violate equal protection because one obvious, adequate justification for focusing upon sexual intercourse between males and minor females was the possibility of pregnancy. The court also stated that the legislature could rationally have concluded that the danger of sexual exploitation by adult males of minor females and the resulting stigma and shame attendant on such activity were so severe that this activity should be specially proscribed in a separate statute. In addition, the court determined that defendant's mistake as to the age of the child was not a defense.

Defendant argued that the State committed prejudicial error when defendant made a demand for a written summary of all oral statements of the defendant that the State intended to use at trial and the State subsequently used other oral statements. The court concluded the error would not require reversal because no prejudice was shown by defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of intentionally intercepting a wire communication in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 968.31(1)(a), 939.05(1). Defendant also challenged the order that denied his motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As a private investigator, defendant provided electronic equipment to his male client in order to make the tap of the telephone of his client's wife. The tap was made in order to investigate marital problems of defendant's client. Defendant's client subsequently died and some of the client's previous statements were admitted into evidence. Defendant contended that this hearsay evidence was improperly admitted at both the preliminary hearing and at the trial. Defendant asserted that, without inadmissible hearsay, the trial court could not have found probable cause and, therefore, the information should not have issued. The court affirmed the conviction and found that there was sufficient evidence, free of any hearsay taint, adduced at the preliminary examination to warrant a finding of probable cause. The court also found that there was sufficient evidence properly admitted at trial pursuant to which the jury could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In reviewing the record, the court found that defendant's trial attorney never objected at trial to the admission of any testimony because it was hearsay. Therefore, defendant waived the admissibility of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment and order of the trial court. The court concluded that defendant was bound over for trial on the basis of evidence sufficient to show probable cause. The trial judge properly denied the order to dismiss the information. Defendant was found guilty on the basis of sufficient evidence to permit the jury to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the trial judge properly refused the motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) which affirmed the trial court's conviction of defendant for promoting participation in a chain distributor system, in violation of Wis. Admin. Code &sect; AG 122.03. The department regulations were found not to exceed the delegated statutory authority and were promulgated in accordance with the required rule-making procedures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the legislature's delegation set reasonable limits for agency action and that the agency stayed within those limits in promulgating the rules. The legislature had the power to authorize the imposition of criminal penalties for the violation of department rules. The administrative regulation under which defendant was charged was specific and not void for vagueness. The constitutional protection afforded free speech did not apply to commercial advertising or the promoting of products and the regulation was not unconstitutional under the First Amendment. Further, speech used to promote a criminal scheme was not entitled to First Amendment protection. Certain hearsay evidence used to show that defendant promoted a chain distributor scheme was admissible under the co-conspirators exception or as defendant's adoptive admission. The pretrial publicity was not prejudicial to defendant because nothing in the newspaper brought facts to the attention of the jury that they did not already know from testimony properly admitted into the record. The trial court was not required to question the jurors when the story itself was not prejudicial. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff appealed the summary judgment that the Circuit Court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin) granted in favor of defendant and the dismissal of his cause of action, arguing that the trial court erred in concluding that his action was barred by the Age of Majority Act, Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.33 (1967), as amended by Wis. Stat. ch. 213, Laws of 1971.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff sustained injury when he was 17 years old, and he attained the age of 18 in 1969. In 1971, the Age of Majority Act, Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.33 (1967), was amended to reduce the age of majority from 21 to 18. Plaintiff commenced suit against defendant 11 months after he attained the age of 21. Defendant moved for summary judgment, contending that plaintiff's claim was barred under the Age of Majority Act, Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.33 (1967), as amended by Wis. Stat. ch. 213, Laws of 1971. The trial court granted defendant's motion and dismissed plaintiff's claim. Plaintiff appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that, where plaintiff was a minor at the time of his injury and was over 18 on the date the legislature passed the amendment to the Age of Majority Act and where plaintiff commenced his suit just prior to his 22nd birthday but more than a year after the age of majority had been reduced to 18, plaintiff's suit was time-barred. The amendment removed the disabilities of minority of all persons between the ages of 18 and 21 and rendered the age of majority to be that of 18. To timely file his suit, plaintiff must have filed suit one year from the date of the amendment.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were convicted of robbery and murder. Defendants appealed and the court affirmed. Defendants' right to a speedy trial was not violated because balancing any prejudice that existed, it could not successfully be maintained that defendants were denied a speedy trial. Defendants were not entitled to a severance of their cases because while certain evidence not relating to all three defendants was received, their connection together and to the crimes involved, was established. Therefore, it was not an abuse of discretion to deny a severance on the one-line-of-evidence doctrine. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by limiting inquiry by counsel into racial prejudice on voir dire. It did allow numerous questions to be asked and the questions were sufficient to focus the attention of the veniremen on any racial prejudice they might have had. The court found no merit to defendants' contentions on the issue of sufficiency of the evidence. The court was satisfied that there had not been a miscarriage of justice or that a new trial would lead to a different result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Department of Industry, Labor, and Human Relations (department) challenged an order by the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which reversed a decision of the department that found that appellee employer's maternity leave policies violated Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that the employer had violated statutes and administrative rules, as well as the constitutional protections regarding due process, with its maternity leave policy. Moreover, the court held that the employer had coerced its pregnant employees into taking a mandatory six months leave even if they had not wanted to do so. In reviewing whether the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) was followed by the department, the court found that the department had violated the sections that required that two people hear the claims at all times. The department's habit was to tape the statements and then let various people listen to the tapes, which did not satisfy the oral argument requirement of the APA. The court also found that to satisfy the oral argument requirement of Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.12, at least two commissioners had to be physically present to hear the argument. If this requirement was not met, the absent third commissioner could not participate. Finally, the court held that employees on maternity had to be treated in the same manner as employees on leave.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a juvenile, was adjudicated delinquent by a juvenile court and was ordered to be in state custody. The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) upheld the juvenile court's decision. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that being transferred to the legal custody of the State until the age of 18 was unconstitutional because the confinement could extend beyond the sentence for an adult who committed an equivalent crime. The court rejected this argument. It stated that a commitment of a juvenile was not for the purpose of penalty or punishment, but for the purpose of effecting a result that would serve the best interests of the child, his parents, and the public. Next, the court rejected defendant's argument that the juvenile court had not sufficiently determined that no less onerous disposition would serve the purpose of the commitment. Stating that the &quot;least restrictive alternative&quot; test advocated by defendant came from federal decisions dealing with the civil commitment of persons adjudged mentally ill, the court held that the factors involved in making an appropriate disposition in a delinquency case could not be capsulized or narrowed in that manner. Rather, the court stated, in arriving at a disposition, the juvenile court was to balance the paramount interest of the minor against those of parents and the public, and the juvenile court in this case had properly done so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner village appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which affirmed an order of respondent Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (Department), issued pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 144.025, directing the village to construct a public water supply according to approved plans no later than a certain date. The circuit court granted a one-year extension of time for compliance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Department issued the order after finding that the absence of a municipal water system tended to create a menace to the health of the community. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. Wis. Stat. &sect; 144.025(2)(r) clearly authorized the Department to issue the order. It provided that if the Department found that the absence of a municipal system tended to create a nuisance or menace to health or comfort, it could order the governmental entity to construct such system within a specified time. The court rejected the village's argument that the Department could not issue the order until the village had conducted a referendum of the electorate under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.065, which was used when a municipality acquired a public plant. A municipal corporation was a creature of the legislature, and the legislature could direct alternative methods by which a municipal corporation could construct a public facility. The court also rejected the village's argument that the order took the private property of well owners without just compensation. The deprivation of well use was exercised under the state's police power. Thus, it did not constitute a &quot;taking&quot; in the constitutional sense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of failing to report a contribution of $ 800's worth of postage stamps. On appeal, the court affirmed his conviction. The court held that the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the State was sufficient for the jury to have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the contribution was to defendant personally, and not his voluntary committee, and that he intentionally withheld reporting. The court held that as a matter of law the wilful and deliberate failure to report the contribution either before or after the election constituted a substantial violation of &sect; 12.09. The preliminary statement of defendant's committee was relevant evidence because it tended to show that the committee was not organized until after receipt of the contribution. The document was admissible under Wis. Stat. &sect; 908.03(24) as it had circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness. Defendant failed to alleged even a prima facie case of prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct, and he presented no proof of selective prosecution. Wis. Stat. &sect; 12.70 (1971) was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant because the offense clearly stated that it was punishable by imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

The charge stemmed from petitioner's arrest and a search of his person following his citation for a traffic violation. In his habeas action in the trial court, petitioner filed a motion to suppress all evidence seized based upon his theory that an arrest warrant issued by a municipal judge in connection with the traffic violation was invalid, and, therefore, the arrest and search were illegal. The motion was denied. Petitioner challenged the trial court's jurisdiction over him and the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.12(1)(a). The trial court denied the petition for habeas corpus relief, and the court affirmed. It held that petitioner waived his right to challenge the jurisdiction of the trial court when he filed his motion to suppress and thereby requested affirmative relief from the trial court. The court also ruled that the uniform traffic citation issued to petitioner provided a sufficient basis for a finding that there was probable cause to issue a warrant pursuant to Wis.

The trial court denied the petition and ordered the mother to contribute to the father's legal fees. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the stipulation was not ambiguous, and it did not require the father to make child support payments beyond the age of majority. Without a stipulation to the contrary, the father was not legally obligated to make such payments. In light of the financial status of the parties, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to require the father to pay college expenses, and the modification statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 247.25, did not deny due process by creating an unconstitutional presumption.

A commitment order was issued by the municipal court, which was to be stayed unless payment was not received on the forfeitures.

Defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and alleged that he did not have a job and that he was without funds to pay the forfeiture. The trial court granted the writ of habeas corpus. On review, the court found that defendant did not advise the municipal court that he was indigent at the time judgment was entered, or at any time prior to his commitment. The court concluded that in the absence of defendant raising the issue, there was no requirement that the municipal court make an indigency determination. Furthermore, the court found that there was insufficient evidence to determine whether defendant was indigent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complaint in two of the cases alleged that defendant had obscene pictures in his possession for sale. The complaint failed to state that defendant intended to possess and sell the pictures, and defendant contended that the complaint was therefore defective. On appeal, the court held that an allegation of scienter, or criminal intent, was a jurisdictional prerequisite in an obscenity case and reversed defendant's convictions in those two cases. The court noted that the mere allegation that defendant possessed the pictures &quot;feloniously&quot; did not amount to an allegation of scienter or intent. As to defendant's third conviction, the court applied the standard that &quot;obscene&quot; meant works that described sexual conduct which as a whole appealed to the prurient interest in sex, portrayed sexual conduct in an offensive way, and had no serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. The court noted that the proper community standard was a statewide standard and defined sexual conduct as including but not limited to acts of sexual intercourse, display of the nude stimulated body, and relations between humans and animals.</SPAN></P>

The association also asserted a violation of the open meeting law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.77. The Circuit Court for Outagamie County (Wisconsin) sustained the board's demurrer to the open meeting claim and found in favor of the board as to the association's other claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court agreed with the trial court that the complaint failed to allege that any teacher had requested an open meeting and held, therefore, the demurrer to the open meeting claim was properly sustained. However, the court found that the teachers were deprived of a constitutional property right when they were discharged, and the board was not an impartial decision-maker in a constitutional sense, so the teachers were denied due process of law. The court further determined that the legislature had not provided the teachers with an adequate remedy and, therefore, pursuant to Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, the court fashioned an adequate remedy. The court held that, in those situations where an employed teacher was discharged or otherwise disciplined and due process was required, and the school board was in an adversary position, the dissatisfied teacher or teachers could, upon petition, obtain a de novo determination of all issues in any court of record in the county where the school district or a part of it was located.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Wisconsin statute mandated that classes for religious instruction were to be conducted elsewhere than in the public school buildings. The students were released during the school day so that they could leave the school grounds and go to religious centers for instruction. The court determined that the state could suspend its operations as to those who wanted to repair to their religious sanctuary for worship or instruction. The court found no use or expenditure of public funds involved in the type of released time program established by the Wisconsin statute. The court saw no problem of either constitutional dimension or legislative construction involved in the establishment, by the use of the word &quot;shall,&quot; of a released time program as a duty rather than as a power of a local school board. The court concluded, therefore, that the released time for religious instruction statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 118.155, did not violate the establishment of religion clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, or the freedom of worship or district school sections of the Wisconsin Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court ruled that whether the sprinkler system was an &quot;improvement to real property&quot; was a question for the jury.

No interpretation of the facts could bring the date of the injury within six years of either the end of the installer's performance or the completion of the total construction. The court held that: (1) a high-pressure water system designed for fire protection was, as a matter of law, &quot;an improvement to real property&quot; under &sect; 893.155 and the trial court erred in deciding that there was an issue for the jury; (2) &sect; 893.155 was unconstitutional because it granted immunity to a class of defendants on a basis that was unreasonable and denied other possible defendants equal protection of the laws; (3) &sect; 893.155 deprived plaintiffs of a remedy for a wrong that was recognized by the laws of the state and Wis.

The county court found that the six-year statute of limitation in Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.19(3) had run.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A heater was installed in a facility and inspected by the architect. The architect did not see any defects. Several years later, a broken weld was discovered in the heater. The company repaired the heater, and the architect inspected it. Thereafter, the heater caused a fire in the facility. An insurer filed a negligence action against the company and the architect. The company filed a cross-complaint against the architect for contribution. The county court determined that the six-year statute of limitations had run before the fire as the statute began running when the heater was installed. The company argued that the six-year statute of limitations did not begin to run until the fire occurred. On appeal, the court determined that the county court erred in its determination that the statute of limitations began to run when the heater was installed. The court found that the injury did not occur which started the running of the statute of limitations until the fire happened. The court concluded that the architect waived its defense of the running of the statute of limitations because it failed to plead the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A negligence action was brought by the decedents' estates solely against design engineers under the third-party action section of the Workmen's Compensation Act, Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.29, for the death of employees on a job site when a retaining wall collapsed. Four years later, the estates filed an amended complaint and joined the employer. The employer demurred, alleging that the actions were not commenced within the three-year statute of limitations provided by Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.205(2) and that the complaint failed to state an action. The lower court sustained the demurrers, finding that the six-year statute of limitations of Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.29 was inapplicable and did not consider the alternative ground. An appeal was taken. The court held that the demurrers should have been sustained as the complaint failed to state a cause of action. There was no allegation of any affirmative act of negligence by the employer which increased the risk of injury. Rather, the complaint alleged nothing more than the employer's failure to provide his employees with a safe place to work. The court further held that the trial court should have sustained the demurrer on the statute of limitations grounds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 49.195 had not yet been enacted when the decedent received her welfare benefits. The statute allowed for recovery of amounts paid as aid to families with dependent children. The county sought reimbursement from the decedent's estate for benefits it had provided to her. Respondent personal representative challenged as unconstitutional language in the statute that made it retroactive to aid received prior to the statute's effective date. The court affirmed holding that the representative had met his burden of establishing that the statute was unconstitutional to the extent that it allowed for retroactive application. The statute created a new right in the county to recover welfare payments. Where a new right was created, it could not be constitutionally applied retroactively. The court rejected the argument that the &sect; 49.195 did not create a new right because the county had an existing common law right of recovery of the welfare payments. No such common law right existed. The words in the statute that improperly made it retroactive were stricken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a passenger in a vehicle, was seriously injured in an accident and sued defendant city for negligence. Plaintiff introduced evidence as to defendant's duties with regard to road maintenance. Defendant appealed an adverse verdict, and asserted that the jury was given an improper instruction regarding Wis.

On review, the court indicated that the jury instructions were proper. As to the issue of contributory negligence, the court indicated that, under the facts, plaintiff was not negligent in riding with driver of the car, even though drinking was involved. The court ruled that it was not error for the trial court to refuse to submit a question on plaintiff's contributory negligence. The rulings were thus affirmed by the court. Finally, defendant contested the waiver of liability limits found by the trial court, and the court reversed, holding that defendant did not intend to waive the partial defense when it purchased liability insurance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which convicted her of four violations of the Madison obscenity ordinance. Defendant claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutional, the evidence was insufficient to prove she had the requisite scienter or knowledge, and that she could not be convicted of four violations of the ordinance based on a single sale, albeit of four allegedly obscene magazines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that her four convictions for selling four different obscene magazines in a single transaction in violation of a city ordinance were error because the definition of &quot;obscenity&quot; in the ordinance did not conform to the most recent constitutionally permissible definition of &quot;obscenity&quot; established by the United States Supreme Court. The court agreed and reversed defendant's conviction. However, it also held that charges against defendant need not be dismissed because the objective of the ordinance, to proscribe the sale of obscene materials to the maximum constitutionally permissible extent, could be accomplished without the aid of the invalid definition by interpreting the ordinance to incorporate the most recent constitutionally permissible definition of obscenity articulated by the Wisconsin Supreme Court consistent with United States Supreme Court decisions. In light of Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.12 the allegations identifying the provision of the ordinance that defendant was charged with violating were sufficient without a specific allegation of scienter. Since defendant sold four different magazines, she was properly charged with four separate offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and the cause was remanded for a new trial to determine whether the magazines defendant sold were obscene according to the Chobot definition of obscenity.</SPAN></P>

The doctors raised affirmative defense to the actions under Wis. Stat. &sect; 155.06(7) under the Anatomical Gift Act. The court reversed the judgment in regard to her treatment while she was alive because the immunity did not extend to the treatment of the donor prior to her death. However, the court affirmed the judgment in so far as it related to the mutilation of the corpse action because the statute provided immunity for the treatment that occurred after her death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a credit union obtained a judgment against the debtor, the debtor was ordered to appear before a court commissioner to make a disclosure of her assets as provided in Wis. Stat. ch. 273. Based upon the debtor's failure to appear at the supplementary proceeding, the debtor was served with an order to show cause why she should not be held in contempt. Following the debtor's failure to appear at the hearing on the show cause order, the trial court issued a body attachment and ordered the debtor to appear before the court commissioner for a supplementary proceeding. On appeal, the court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 425.113, which prohibited body attachments of debtors with respect to consumer credit transactions, did not exempt the debtor from being required to appear and make a disclosure in a supplementary proceeding. The court determined that the body attachment was properly issued under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 295.01 and 295.04 based upon the debtor's failure to respond to a lawful court order. Because Wis. Stat. &sect; 425.113 did not remove the trial court's power to issue a body attachment for one who ignored court orders, &sect; 425.113 did not violate the principle of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

Items of property had been removed from the apartment and there was evidence of two fires set by a human hand. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, robbery, and arson. In affirming, the court rejected defendant's argument that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. While the court noted that it would have been lawful for the jury to convict defendant based upon the uncorroborated testimony of his accomplice, the court found that the testimony by defendant's accomplice was corroborated by other evidence. The court rejected defendant's argument that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because both he and his brother were represented by the same attorney at the time of the brother's earlier trial. The court found that defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's application of the alibi statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 955.07 (1965) and the last sentence of Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.23(3), and that defendant was not entitled to retroactive application of the case law invalidating the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found defendant not guilty of rape but convicted him of the included offense of fornication. Defendant argued on appeal that the fornication statute was an unconstitutional invasion of his right to privacy because intercourse occurred between consenting adults. Defendant also argued that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing a maximum sentence and in refusing to give him credit for the period of his pre-conviction incarceration. The court affirmed the conviction. Because the act was clearly not consensual, defendant could not challenge the fornication statute on constitutional grounds on the basis that the act was consensual. There was a rational basis for the sentences in view of the record. When imposing a sentence, the trial court had to take into consideration the time defendant had spent in pre-conviction custody. The court therefore reversed and remanded defendant's sentence because the record was not clear as to the time he actually spent in custody prior to his conviction and whether or not it was due to his financial inability to post bail.</SPAN></P>

Appellants contended that the residue of the deceased's estate should not have passed to the legal heirs under the laws of intestacy but were distributable to the other residuary beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants were the children of the named beneficiary or the residuary legatee, who died before the testatrix. Appellants contended that the named beneficiary's share, a lapsed legacy, should not pass as intestate property because some of it would thus pass to the specifically disinherited individuals. The trial court ruled that the residue was to pass by intestate succession. Affirming the trial court below, the court upheld the anti-lapse statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 853.27, which presumed a testamentary intent of substitution and legacies to persons where were, but not to persons who were not, related to the testatrix. The court held that the residue was to pass to the heirs by intestacy, as the presumption against intestacy was of no effect when the testatrix had provided no indication, by the language used, of her intent in the situation. The court found the testatrix's will gave no indication of any kind as to the intended disposition of the residue of her estate in the event of a lapse, and that the trial court thus properly refused to consider extrinsic evidence as to the testator's intent, except when there was language in the will subject to several reasonable interpretations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order in favor of respondents and against that of appellants, which ordered that the lapsed legacy, the named beneficiary's share of the residue, should not pass to appellants, her children, since they were not related to the testatrix. Rather, the residue was required to pass as intestate property to the legal heirs.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 146.31. The lower court declared the statute unconstitutional. In affirming, the court found that although the evidence supported defendant's conviction, &sect; 146.31 was unconstitutional because it violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, as well as the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI. The court held that the State's interest in promoting the public health in those few instances where the federal requirements would not adequately prevent a donor from making too frequent donations and where a Wisconsin resident might be a recipient of defendant's blood even though the blood was sold entirely outside the State of Wisconsin, was insufficient to justify the substantial burden the statute placed on interstate commerce. Furthermore, the court found that the statute prohibited defendant from engaging in an occupation for which it was licensed under federal law.

On appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court's decision upon finding that, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 247.21, the beneficiary's judgment of divorce against her first husband was of no effect in Wisconsin because she, a domiciliary of Wisconsin, went to Mexico for the purpose of obtaining a divorce for a cause which occurred in Wisconsin and for a cause that was not a ground for divorce under the laws of Wisconsin. The constitutional mandate of &quot;full faith and credit&quot; was not applicable because the beneficiary's divorce decree was obtained in a jurisdiction outside of the United States. Under &sect; 247.21, &quot;incompatibility of temperaments&quot; was not recognized in Wisconsin as a ground for divorce.

The court affirmed. The court found no statutory requirement that the corporate officer who was responsible for the misappropriation of funds had to personally benefit from the misappropriation in order to have been held liable. The corporate president was responsible for the money received from the loans that were secured by mortgages and he used that money to pay defendant corporation's ordinary business expenses. He did not use the money to pay the contractor in full for the materials and labor supplied for the construction of three homes, in spite of the fact that under &sect; 289.02(5) he was to hold that money in trust for the contractor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of a class of borrowers, challenged orders of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) in eight consolidated cases. The borrowers claimed that they paid usurious interest to defendant retailers. The trial court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 138.06(6) and (7) constitutionally removed the right of pre-October 9, 1970 credit sale usury victims to recover penalties and to maintain class actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The constitutionality of &sect; 138.06(6), eliminating penalties and allowing recovery of only excess interest, was not at issue. The borrowers claimed that &sect; 138.06(7), outlawing class actions for pre-October 9, 1970 claims, was unconstitutional because it denied them equal protection, contrary to the 14th Amendment and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, and violated Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court noted that &sect; 138.06(7) was passed after the court's Penney decision. The governor had urged that the Penney decision exposed retailers in Wisconsin to potentially bankrupting liability under the usury laws. The court opined that the legislation served a legitimate public purpose and was constitutional. Further, there was a rational justification for treating post- and pre-Penney usury victims differently because, after the court's Penney decision, retailers in Wisconsin were on notice that the usury laws applied to revolving charge accounts. Thus, any further violations were not in good faith. Finally, &sect; 138.06(7) did not violate Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 because, if a retailer refused to refund excess interest, borrowers had a &quot;day in court&quot; and a &quot;certain remedy,&quot; &quot;conformably to the laws.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individual claimed that the board's charge for textbook rental and the board's fees for incidental educational supplies were unconstitutional. The court held that the board could sell or charge fees for the use of textbooks without violating Wis. Const. art. X, &sect; 3. No fee could be charged for instruction, for physical facilities, or for physical equipment. Under Wisconsin law, textbooks had to be furnished free to indigents; items similar to textbooks, such as workbooks, could have been sold or rented by the schools. Individually used items, such as pencils, pens, notebooks, paper, gym suits, towels, and band instruments, were not free under &sect; 3. Further evidence was required to establish what items were included in the incidental educational supplies for which the board charged a fee. The trial court had to determine if the fees were for permissible purposes and were reasonable in amount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The portion of the trial court's judgment that upheld the board's charge for textbook rental was affirmed. The case was remanded for a determination as to what was included in the fee for incidental educational supplies charged by the board and whether such fees were for a permissible purpose and were reasonable in amount.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner parolee brought an original action for declaratory judgment against respondents, a county, its chief judge, and the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services, to determine which branch of the government was required to appoint and compensate counsel required in administrative proceedings for the revocation of probation and parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was entitled to counsel for his parole revocation proceedings but the county's chief judge refused to appoint counsel because he lacked statutory authority to do so and because no county funds were available for that purpose. Petitioner requested the Department of Health and Social Services to provide counsel, but it also declined because it was beyond its authority and no funds had been appropriated. The Wisconsin state public defender alleged that his office had always provided counsel before and all were satisfied with the services. The court ruled that (1) the state public defender should again provide counsel in such situations, (2) the appointments would be made by the court, not by the county or its chief judge, and (3) the State of Wisconsin, not the county, would be responsible for the public defender's compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The public defender was appointed to represent all indigent persons in probation and parole revocation proceedings, including petitioner, upon notification by the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services that representation, under the existing standards, was appropriate in a particular case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers filed a declaratory judgment action against the county and challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 70.99. The trial court ruled in favor of the county, and the court affirmed the order. The court held that the taxpayers' complaint, liberally construed, sought to enjoin illegal governmental expenditure. The court found that it could imply that the taxpayers were suing to vindicate rights of all taxpayers. The court held that the taxpayers' pecuniary loss was sufficiently established and that the taxpayers had standing to maintain the action. The court concluded that &sect; 70.99 did not violate Wis. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 9; art. XI, &sect; 3; or art. IV, &sect; 23. The court found that the county assessor was a county official. The court held that the objective in Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.99 of equality in taxation was a matter of statewide concern. The court concluded that the uniformity requirement of the home-rule amendment was not applicable and that &sect; 70.99 was, on its face, uniformly applicable throughout the state. The court noted that each county had an equal right to decide to adopt a countywide assessor system and that any &quot;classifications&quot; produced by &sect; 70.99 were reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">By an original action for writ of habeas corpus, petitioner, who was found not guilty of a crime by reason of mental disease or defect, challenged the constitutionality of Wis.

Citing a United States Supreme Court decision that the principle that a defendant could not be committed after an insanity acquittal without affording him all the procedural protections provided to others who were involuntarily committed, the court held that &sect; 971.17(1) and (2)&nbsp;unconstitutionally denied a defendant equal protection and due process. The court also held that the question whether a defendant was presently suffering from mental illness and was in need of institutionalized treatment had to be submitted to a jury, that it was not unconstitutional to place on a defendant the burden of proving that he could be released with safety based on examination of him in his then condition, and that its decision would not apply to petitioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, Wisconsin Attorney General, and Intervenor student filed an action to force respondent, Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Administration, to honor a requisition for a school district contract with a private institution for provision of special education services under Wis. Stat. &sect; 115.85(2)(d). The Secretary argued that &sect; 115.85(2)(d) violated the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Secretary claimed that &sect; 115.85(2)(d) was unconstitutional because it allowed school districts to contract with private institutions for such services, thereby permitting state financial support of and involvement in religious activity. After review, the court disagreed. First, the purpose of the statute, to provide every exceptional child with a free special education program suited to his needs, was clearly secular. Second, the primary effect of &sect; 115.85(2)(d) was not to advance religion because contracting for services would not place school authorities in the position of providing aid to the religious as opposed to the secular activities of the private institutions. Third, the statute did not foster impermissible entanglement with religion. Rather, &sect; 115.85(2)(d) expressly prohibited contracts with institutions that taught religiously indoctrinated programs. Thus, the statute did not violate the First Amendment. Likewise, the statute did not violate Wis. Const. art I, &sect; 18 because its primary effect was not the advancement of a religious organization, but the provision of special educational services to the handicapped children of Wisconsin, a secular purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer appealed a ruling from the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which entered judgment in favor of respondent Wisconsin Department of Revenue in the taxpayer's appeal of a general sales tax assessment against the taxpayer's sale of tangible personal business property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer, who was in the dry cleaning business, held a seller's permit for his business pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.52. The taxpayer &quot;ceased operation&quot; of the business by the sale of the property at issue; the buyer continued operating the business as the new owner. The taxpayer did not report the sale of the property on his sales tax returns, and the Department assessed a general sales tax against the sale. The instant litigation resulted. The court held that when the business property was sold, the sale failed to come within the statutory definition of &quot;occasional sale&quot; because the taxpayer still held a sales permit. Even upon willful failure to surrender the sales permit and come within the occasional sale exemption, a businessman could simply pass the tax on to the purchaser as was done in most every case where the sales tax was imposed. The taxpayer failed to overcome the presumption of the constitutionality of &sect; 77.52(3). The object of the tax was to raise revenues, and the taxpayer's arguments failed to rebut the strong presumption accorded such tax provisions. Administrative convenience often served as a valid basis upon which to levy a tax on a particular transfer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent state agencies appealed a writ of mandamus and a writ of prohibition issued by the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) on the application of petitioner, a minor held in the Milwaukee County Detention Home while awaiting placement, arguing that confinement of the members of the class, including the minor, in the detention home was not illegal as a matter of statutory law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The minor petitioned for a writ of mandamus and a writ of prohibition on his own behalf and on behalf of children similarly situated, seeking their release from a detention home in which they were held while awaiting placement. The circuit granted the minor's petition and limited temporary detention to a 48-hour period. The state agencies appealed. In affirming the granting of the writs, the court concluded that there was no statutory authority for children's court judges to order children detained in the detention home after their status had been adjudicated and they were awaiting placement. The enumeration of the specific alternatives in the Children's Code, Wis. Stat. ch. 48, was evidence of the legislative intent that any alternative not specifically authorized was to be excluded, and the legislature excluded post-adjudication detention in that institution as an acceptable alternative. The circuit court's writs were modified, however, to reflect that the longest such a child could be held in such facility was five days rather than 48 hours.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The writ of mandamus and the writ of prohibition limiting temporary detention to 48 hours was modified to limit temporary detention to no more than five days. As modified, the writs were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Wis. Stat. &sect; 539.1 attempted to pass along tax &quot;concessions&quot; to renters that their landlords received as property owners. In their declaratory judgment action, the landlords contended, among other things, that the statute impaired the obligation of contracts, which was prohibited by U.S. Const. art. I, &sect;10 and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 539.1 was unconstitutional because it impaired the contractual obligations in the leases at issue. Section 539.1 did not merely affect the involved parties' remedies, but it impaired the very consideration that had been agreed upon. Moreover, there seemed to be no compelling public interest to override the impinging of the obligation of contract because neither the parties nor the legislature had identified such an interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was diverting water from two creeks for irrigation purposes and had no permit to do so. Defendant urged that he had been denied equal protection of the law because the State did not require permits from industrial users and that &sect; 30.18 deprived him of property without just compensation. The State amended the complaint by deletion, and defendant complained that the deletions reduced from five to three the elements of the crime that the State was required to establish. The court held that the applicable legislative classification had a reasonable basis and that it was for the legislature and not for the court to determine the exact point at which a classification was to operate. Section 30.18 represented an exercise of the State's police power rather than the power of eminent domain; it did not create or improve the public condition but only preserved nature from despoilage and harm that resulted from unrestricted human activity. As for the amendment of the complaint, the court held that a properly prepared attorney faced no additional burden when the number of elements involved was reduced and that the amendment was not ground for reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's fingerprints were identified one year after a crime was committed. Officers going on duty at 10:30 p.m. read a bulletin identifying defendant and immediately went to his mother's home, but he was not there. They returned to the home at 5 a.m. and arrested him. Defendant asserted that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him without a warrant. On review, the court affirmed. The phrase &quot;probable cause to arrest&quot; referred to a quantum of evidence that would have led a reasonable police officer to believe that defendant probably committed a crime. The entire quantum of evidence necessary to establish probable cause was not required to be within the personal knowledge of the individual arresting officer. The knowledge of one officer was imputed to all officers in the department. The fact that the mother could be expected to alert defendant that police were looking for him created an exigency justifying the warrantless arrest. The court also held that, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.31(5)(b), defendant was not permitted to file a motion to suppress post-arrest statements at arraignment or until an information was filed; therefore, his motion to suppress was timely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was on probation for commercial gambling. The Department of Human and Social Services revoked his probation because Defendant had been spending time at a bar that he was forbidden to enter under the terms of his probation. Defendant sought a writ of certiorari, contending that the revocation was an abuse of discretion. The trial court quashed the writ and affirmed the revocation. Defendant appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed and ruled that the evidence established that the department acted clearly within its discretion, consistent with the purposes of probation. The court concluded that the condition violated by defendant was one of the most important conditions of his probation because the bar was the center of his gambling activities. Thus, defendant's return to the bar was not a nominal violation but went to the heart of his chances of rehabilitation and was integrally related to the risk that he would indulge in his criminal activities to the detriment of not only himself but to society as well.</SPAN></P>

An appellate court was permitted to have retained an appeal for determination if it involved questions of public interest even though it had become moot as to the particular parties involved.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Wis. Stat. &sect; 120.41(1) provided that the territory outside a city, which was joined with city territory in the formation of a city school district, was attached to the city for school purposes. Wis. Stat. &sect; 121.54(1) stated that mandatory transportation provisions did not apply to pupils who resided in cities, unless the school they attended was located outside the city but within the boundaries of the school district. The joint city school district included pupils who lived inside and outside of the city. When the district refused to provide transport to any of its pupils, including those outside the city, the individuals filed an action to compel the district to provide transportation. The circuit court denied the writ. On appeal, the court explained that Wis. Stat. &sect; 120.41(1) merely allowed the district to function as a city agency; it did not mean that the city and non-city territory could never be distinguished. The purpose of Wis. Stat. &sect; 121.54 was to provide school transportation and was liberally construed. The court enforced the plain meaning of city residence, not the district's attempt to read in constructive city residence as a part of &sect; 121.54.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the Madison Metropolitan Sewerage District (Wisconsin) and others, disputed an order of the County Court of Dane County (Wisconsin), which construed Wis. Stat. &sect; 144.05(1) (1969) as incorporating those provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 66.20 to 66.209 that had previously been held unconstitutional, including Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.202, and, accordingly, denied the sewerage district's attempt to annex certain territory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court reiterated its denial of a motion to dismiss the appeal by respondents, a citizens group, a citizen, and the city of Madison, Wisconsin. The dispute focused on whether the reference in &sect; 144.05(1) to Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.205(1) incorporated &sect;&sect; 66.20 to 66.209 into &sect; 144.05(1). Finding that the reference created an ambiguity in &sect; 144.05(1), the court considered the legislative history to aid in the construction of &sect; 144.05(1). The court held that the legislature could constitutionally assign to the courts the statutory duty to enter an order attaching municipalities to sewerage districts if certain conditions were judicially found to exist. Thus, the trial court erred in ruling that appellants' interpretation would result in an unconstitutional procedure. But, the trial court correctly concluded that the second sentence of &sect; 144.05(1) made it clear that municipalities were eligible for attachment under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.205(1) even if they were only partially within the drainage basin served by the sewerage districts. Thus, the reference in &sect; 66.205(1) to a &quot;court proceeding&quot; similar to that for the creation of a district had to incorporate the provisions of &sect; 66.202.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant assaulted a young woman. When police arrived on the scene, they discovered defendant's wallet. Defendant subsequently contacted the police by telephone to inquire about his missing wallet.

He moved to suppress his statement to police, contending that his arrest was illegal. His motion was denied. Following his conviction, defendant challenged the denial of his suppression motion. In affirming, the court concluded that the trial court did not err in refusing to suppress the statement as the product of an illegal arrest. Although the police arrested defendant outside of the city limits, the arrest was justified by probable cause where defendant's wallet was found at the scene of the crime and where defendant was identified by the victim in the presence of the arresting officers immediately prior to his arrest. The fact that the arrest was made outside of the city limits was insufficient to render defendant's subsequent statement inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner widow appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which had dismissed her petition for a writ of prohibition to restrain respondents district attorney and medical examiner from conducting an inquest into her husband's death. She claimed that the inquest violated her right of privacy, that the district attorney did not have authority to order the inquest, and that he abused his discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district attorney directed the medical examiner to conduct an inquest although the medical examiner had already signed a death certificate. A business associate of the widow's husband who had married into the family had died only a short time before. The widow argued that the purpose of the inquest was to investigate not only her husband's death but also the associate's. The court held that any right to privacy enjoyed by the widow was outweighed by the public interest in the investigation of possible criminal actions. She could not refuse to cooperate with the inquest based upon a claimed invasion of privacy. The district attorney clearly had authority under Wis. Stat. &sect; 979.01 to order the medical examiner to conduct the inquest. The decision to order the inquest was discretionary with the district attorney. He was presumed to have properly exercised his discretion. There was insufficient evidence that he wanted to use the inquest to investigate the death of another and thus the widow failed to overcome the presumption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence at the preliminary sufficiently established the state's theory as to the crime that the deceased was shot and killed with a 30.06-caliber rifle.

An investigator for the county sheriff's department testified that two .22-caliber shells were recovered at the site and those shells were compared with other shells previously fired by defendant which had been recovered by another investigator. The shells recovered were found to be identical to those previously fired by defendant. The court held that although the evidence produced was purely circumstantial, circumstantial evidence was sufficient to support a finding of probable cause or guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that there was competent evidence for a judicial mind to act on in determining probable cause. The court also held that the facts educed at trial and reasonable inferences which were able to be drawn from those facts were sufficient to have enabled a reasonable jury to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff father challenged the judgment that dismissed plaintiff's action for a judgment that declared he was the father of defendant minor, and that determined plaintiff's rights and duties as to the care, custody, maintenance, and visitation of defendant minor. Plaintiff also challenged the decision to overrule plaintiff's demurrers to counterclaims by defendants, mother and minor. The court reversed the dismissal of plaintiff's complaint and the order that overruled plaintiff's demurrer to defendant minor's counterclaim. The adulterous conduct of plaintiff was improperly invoked by the trial court as a ground for dismissal of plaintiff's complaint, as such was not a proper justification to prevent plaintiff from trying to establish parental rights. Plaintiff's demurrers to counterclaims by defendant mother were properly overruled, as defendant mother alleged sufficient facts to prove the factors of her claims. The trial court should have dismissed the counterclaims by defendant minor for wrongful birth, as to have allowed the claim would have created a new tort that would have had vast social ramifications and that should only have been created legislatively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was an out-of-state mail order business selling insurance in the state. It challenged the state's application of a general revenue tax pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 201.42 (11) (a) to its business in the state. The lower court approved the application of the statute, and appellant sought review. Appellant argued there was a taking of property without due process. It argued that even if the state could constitutionally apply the general revenue tax, the statute was unconstitutional for failure to apportion the tax on the basis of activities within and outside the state, which in combination produced the gross receipts upon which the tax was levied. Appellant also contended there was insufficient physical presence within the taxing state to provide constitutional jurisdiction to impose such a tax. The court found that there was sufficient physical presence and contacts by appellant in the state to provide the nexus for constitutional imposition of the tax by the state. But because the statute failed to provide for apportionment, the court ruled it violated the due process clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court therefore reversed the judgment of the lower court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of rape and sexual perversion. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment against defendant. The court concluded that the complaint met the test of reliability of the informer and constituted probable cause for a magistrate to proceed with the issuance of a warrant calling for the arrest of defendant. The complaint was based on a police officer's sworn statement of what the alleged victim described as having actually happened. The court found that trial court could have reasonably concluded that defendant had not shown good cause for his failure to give notice at the proper time of his intention to rely on an alibi defense. The court determined that the non-reciprocal notice-of-alibi statute contained in Wis. Stat. &sect; 955.07 (1967) was unconstitutional and that the ruling was retroactive. The court also determined, however, that the error was harmless. The court found that Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a negligence action, plaintiffs appealed from an order and a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), asserting that they were entitled to recovery against defendant State of Wisconsin and its agents and that the trial court incorrectly barred their recovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants defended the action on the basis of sovereign immunity and the statutes that governed the actions. Plaintiffs asserted that defendants waived their right to assert sovereign immunity, that defendant State of Wisconsin and the department of natural resources could be sued directly for negligence, that the existing Wisconsin statutory pattern could not deny to plaintiffs rights secured to them by the Wisconsin Constitution, and that Wis. Stat. &sect; 270.58 created a cause of action against the state in contract. On review, the court found that defendant's demurrer could be and was properly amended by the trial court and that there was no abuse of discretion in that regard. The court found that there was no statutory consent by defendant state to suit in tort. The court found plaintiffs' constitutional arguments to be without merit, as they did not have any inherent &quot;right&quot; to sue the state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, various individuals and a joint venture, appealed from a judgment and an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) that granted defendants, the contractors and builders, summary judgment on the plaintiffs' action to recover for damages allegedly caused by the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property. The trial court held the limitations period in Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.155 barred the claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 893.155 provided that no action for damages for any injury to property or person that arose out of the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property could be brought more than six years after the performance or furnishing of the pertinent services and construction. The court reversed the summary judgment in favor of the defendants. The court reasoned that &sect; 893.155 by itself seemed to withdraw a cause of action before it accrued and therefore was possibly unconstitutional. However, the court read, as it believed it must, &sect; 893.155 with the prefatory statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.14, which provided that the period of limitations in &sect; 893.155 commenced only after a cause of action accrued. In the case before the court, it determined that &sect; 893.155 commenced, then, upon the date that the plaintiffs were aware of their injury or the damage. Thus, that limitations period did not commence on the last day the services or the construction were completed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court treated the summary judgment as a demurrer and reversed the judgment in favor of the contractors and builders, and remanded the matter for further proceedings consistent with the court's conclusion that the statute of limitations did not bar the plaintiffs' action.</SPAN></P>

It was clear that where the legislature had intended to control advertising in connection with a particular calling, it had expressed its intent in specific statutory language. The general language of Wis. Stat. &sect; 15.08(5) did not &quot;necessarily implies&quot; a grant of authority to the pharmacy board to regulate advertising.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the denial of his motion for a new trial in the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), following his conviction for robbery and murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and another robbed a tavern, and during the robbery defendant shot and killed a patron. Defendant escaped in his brother-in-law's car. Defendant and his wife were later apprehended by police while defendant was driving his own car. Defendant and his wife were arrested and taken to the police station, and during a custodial search a great deal of cash was taken from defendant's wife. Defendant was convicted of armed robbery and murder. Defendant's motion for a new trial was denied. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that the facts known to the police were sufficient to establish probable cause to arrest defendant and his wife, and the complaint sufficiently detailed all the facts necessary to establish probable cause. A reasonable policeman would discern that anyone in defendant's car was connected with the crime. Although defendant had standing to raise the legality of the search of his wife, the search was lawful. Given the validity of her arrest, the custodial search of defendant's wife was not limited to weapons or evidence of the crime, and the search did not have to be directed to or related to the purpose of the arrest.</SPAN></P>

It found that the engineer prepared the plans and specifications and was responsible for the construction.

The board held that the engineer's failure to design an open web frame truss that supported a reasonable live load constituted incompetency, stating that the failure to correct the design prior to construction constituted gross negligence. The trial court found that the evidence did not establish incompetency. The court modified the judgment and affirmed, holding that the finding of incompetency was unsupported by substantial evidence. Incompetence under &sect; 443.01(13)(a)(4) referred to some demonstrated lack of competence. There was no evidence that he was warned or told of the defect. There was no finding of fact that he was put on notice. However, the court remanded for a determination as to whether the failure to design and construct the truss constituted gross negligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city presented evidence that the cost to repair exceeded 50 percent of the value of the property under &sect; 66.05(1)(b). The owner presented evidence that the repairs were less than the statutory amount of 50 percent. The trial judge commented that he did not find the owner's evidence credible, in part because of her testimony in similar matters, and the property owner appealed. On appeal, the court held that, because the trial court's finding was based on substantial credible evidence, the finding could not be disturbed on appeal. The trial court's findings of credibility were within the province of the trial court and could not be disturbed unless it was shown that they were based on caprice, abuse of discretion, or error of law. The court rejected the owner's challenge to the constitutionality of the statute, reasoning that the amount of 50 percent of the value of the building as the cost of repairs gave rise to a statutory presumption of condemnation and that, because the property owner did not argue that the repairs were justified in excess of that amount, the statute as applied was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, employees of a corporation, sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which entered a judgment in favor of defendants, shareholders of the corporation. The employees brought an action seeking to hold the shareholders personally responsible for all unpaid debts owed by the corporation to them for services rendered, not to exceed six months of service, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 180.40(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation was a foreign corporation licensed to do business in Wisconsin. The shareholders argued that the words &quot;every corporation&quot; in &sect; 180.40(6) were sufficient to override an express requirement in Wis. Stat. &sect; 180.807 and that the words meant every domestic corporation given the definition of &quot;corporation&quot; in Wis. Stat. &sect; 180.02(1). First, the court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 180.807 did not apply to the issue at hand because it did not deal with shareholders' liability, but with the powers of a foreign corporation. Second, the court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 180.40 (6) applied not only to shareholders of domestic corporations but to shareholders of foreign corporations and that the words &quot;every corporation&quot; in that section were sufficient to include foreign corporations. The court reviewed the statute's legislative history in making its determination. To construe &sect; 180.40 (6) to exclude shareholders of foreign corporations raised the serious question that the section would then be unconstitutional as denying equal protection of the laws to the employees of foreign corporations doing business in Wisconsin by denying them benefits afforded employees of domestic corporations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city claimed to have been a landowner under the provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 29.68 and, therefore, exempt from liability for plaintiff's injuries, absent proof of a willful or malicious failure to warn or guard against a dangerous condition. Because no proof was forthcoming from plaintiff, the city urged that the trial court erred when it denied the city's demurrer. The court found the city's contention was without merit and affirmed the trial court's judgment. Upon review of the legislative history of &sect; 29.68, the court determined that the legislature only intended to protect landowners who opened their lands for public use. The court held that &sect; 29.68 was not applicable to the city so as to have limited its liability for persons injured while present on its property. The court found that &sect; 29.68 was not a special law contrary to the requirements of Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 32. The court held that there was no constitutional proscription of legislative action that limited the liability of landowners. The court held that &sect; 29.68 did not violate the equal protection clause and that its application only to private landowners was neither arbitrary of unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

Two of the incidents resulted in accidents. The administrator cancelled the motorist's license pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.25 without a hearing. After going without a seizure for nine months, the motorist appeared before a medical review board. The review board recommended to the administrator that the motorist not be considered eligible for licensing until he was free of seizures for one year. The court held that cancellation without a hearing was not contrary to statutes and did not deny the motorist due process because the case was not a &quot;contested case&quot; as defined by Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.01 (2); therefore, Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.07 did not require a hearing, and the procedure followed by the administrator was in accordance with applicable statutes.&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.25, which authorized the administrator to cancel the motorist's driver's license without a hearing, did not offend the due process clauses of the United States and state constitutions. Substantial evidence supported the decision to refuse to consider return of the license until the motorist was free of seizures for one year.</SPAN></P>

Based on its review of existing case law, the court held that the term &quot;obscene&quot; was limited in its terms to sexual conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A traffic officer stopped the trucking company's vehicle and ordered that it be weighed. Because the truck was too large for the scale the tractor was weighed separate from the trailer, and the trailer was weighed by resting part of it on the scale and then the other part. The trucking company was charged with violating Wis. Stat. &sect; 348.15(3)(d) because of the excessive weight. The appellate court affirmed. The truck scales had to be in good working order. The scales were tested less than four months before the weighing and were in good working order and properly certified. The method of multiple draft weighing was authorized by statute. Each axle did not have to be weighed separately. The State did not have to separately establish that the procedure was proper when it was unauthorized by statute. Further, when a testing process was authorized by statute, it was presumed correct. The fine was not excessive or unconstitutional because it served an important deterrent effect against dangerous and overloaded trucks. The fine was properly based on the excess over the statutory amount rather than the amount in the trucking company's permit.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile court judge issued an order to show cause why he should not waive the jurisdiction of the children's court pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.18. The trial court granted a motion to dismiss the petition after the lawyer representing the juvenile alleged that &sect; 48.18 did not establish ascertainable standards to limit or guide juvenile judges in exercising their discretion on whether to waive the juvenile court's jurisdiction. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that: (1) it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal; (2) &sect; 48.18 provided for waiver only if the juvenile court judge deemed it contrary to the best interest of the child or of the public to hear the case; (3) Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the trial, defendant recounted a series of prior altercations and encounters between him and the victim.

The trial court refused to instruct on manslaughter, finding that the jury would either believe defendant acted in self-defense or was guilty of murder. The jury convicted defendant. The court held that it was reversible error to refuse to instruct the jury on manslaughter where there was evidence to suggest an imperfect defense of self-defense, that it that defendant's belief that the victim was going to shoot him was unreasonable. The court rejected defendant's argument, however, that the court should adopt a new test for determining if a failure to give an instruction was reversible error.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant State of Wisconsin sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Columbia County (Wisconsin), which found in favor of respondent junkyard in the State's suit to enjoin operations causing noise and vibrations at levels violating a city ordinance. The State sought an injunction to limit operations to what is permitted by the ordinance during the evening and morning hours specified in the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The junkyard was on the only heavy industrial block in the area, and its metal salvaging operations created air noise and ground vibrations. City ordinances prescribed maximum permissible noise and vibration levels, and though the city took no action, the State accused the junkyard of repeatedly violating the ordinance and creating a nuisance. Experts testified that the noise and vibrations exceeded permissible limits, and homeowners testified to disrupted sleep and enjoyment, added expenses, and loss of use. The junkyard showed its attempts to curb the disturbance, evidence that only a few people ever complained, and information on other industrial plants in the area, and the trial court concluded that an injunction was not warranted. On review, the court found that the extent and the nature of the acts and the resulting damage were most important, not the number of witnesses, and that the repeated violations of the ordinance constituted a public nuisance as a matter of law. The court found that the degree of harm determined whether an injunction should issue, and that the operations should be limited according to the hours specified in the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners purchased 296 acres of land in the town with the intent of developing a residential community with a golf course and club house. The next year, the town adopted a zoning ordinance, which changed the zoning classification of the bulk of the property to an agricultural district. The court first determined that the property owners could bring this declaratory action without first exhausting any administrative remedies because they were challenging the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance. In affirming the judgment, the court concluded, as did the trial court, that this zoning ordinance as applied to the lands of the property owners was unconstitutional. The restrictions of the agricultural classification gave at least 216 acres of the land a substantial negative value and the classification was without any reasonable basis. The court held that the classification was unreasonable and contravened Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV on the grounds of both due process and equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant executor sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Racine County (Wisconsin), which upheld the assessment of income tax against the estate by respondent, the Wisconsin Department of Revenue, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 71.03(1)(k) and 71.08(1)(a) and (b) (1963).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent had been a partner in a partnership. The Department included in the estate's income the undistributed partnership earnings that belonged to the decedent. In affirming the judgment the court first rejected the executor's contention that because the decedent had not received the income the Department assessed, it was not includable in a return for income tax purposes under Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.08(1)(a) (1963). The court observed that this construction of &sect; 71.08(1)(a) ignored Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.03(1)(k) (1963), which included in a partner's income his distributive share of the partnership income, whether distributed or not. The court also noted that this was exactly the result indicated by Wis. Admin. Code &sect; TAX 3.71(3) (1964). The court also held that the assessment did not violate the uniformity provision of Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, even though the share had been inventoried and taxed as part of the estate's corpus. The court held that the taxes were separate, and triggered by separate circumstances, and did not amount to double taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that the remedy of mandamus was not available to compel the state department of revenue to adjust its 1972 determination of the full value of the taxable property located within the town in order to correct an error made by the department in making its 1970 full value determination. The trial court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 121.06 did not authorize the department to correct an inaccurate determination in a subsequent year. The trial court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 120.76, stipulated to be controlling, applied only to unified school districts, which the school district at issue was not. The clerk appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that there was no constitutional infirmity in the trial court holding that Wis. Stat. &sect; 121.06 did not grant the state department of revenue the authority to correct an inequitable assessment in a subsequent year and in the trial court holding that Wis. Stat. &sect; 120.76 applied only to unified school districts in Wisconsin.

Defendant alleged that the evidence was insufficient, that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury on entrapment, that his prosecution was discriminatory law enforcement, and that the jury selection violated his due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A drug seller asked defendant to help the seller dispose of her package of drugs, and defendant introduced a state agent to the seller. As a result, defendant was convicted of aiding and abetting the seller in the sale of drugs. On appeal, the court affirmed and held as follows: The evidence was sufficient because defendant's conversation with the seller indicated that they had an arrangement in defendant's efforts to aid the seller. The trial court did not need to charge the jury on entrapment because entrapment was not an issue at trial. Wis. Stat. &sect; 972.08 did not require the trial court to determine if the seller had any reason other than self-incrimination when she declined to testify. The district attorney's decision to grant immunity to the seller but not to defendant was not discriminatory law enforcement because there was no evidence that defendant was being prosecuted solely because of race, creed, or other arbitrary classification. The selection of jury members who were members of juries in similar cases with the same state witness testifying did not deprive defendant of an impartial jury or due process because defendant did not show actual prejudice.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, she challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The court upheld defendant's conviction. The court ruled that defendant was entitled to challenge the entire statute and not just the section under which she was charged because it was argued that the statute appeared facially unconstitutional and if the constitutional attack was successful, the entire statute would be void. The court also ruled that the statute was constitutional. The court noted that since 1858, the statute in question had made it illegal for females to have or make an offer to have nonmarital sexual intercourse for a thing of value. The court held that defendant did not meet her burden of showing the gender classification established by Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.30 was unreasonable, and the record was completely devoid of any showing to that effect. The court also noted that defendant failed to demonstrate any discriminatory enforcement as between the citation of females for the violation of Wis.

During the period of time that the security officer was attempting to remove defendant from the ward, numerous patients were gathering in response to defendant's arguments and refusals to leave the ward. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The complaint was sufficient in that contained facts from which it could be inferred that defendant's conduct was &quot;otherwise disorderly&quot; under Wis. Stat. &sect; 947.01(1). There was sufficient evidence to support the conviction; what was of particular importance was defendant's repeated refusals to leave the ward. The trial court did not commit prejudicial error in admitting opinion testimony of the hospital's head of security and a psychiatrist. Even if the evidence was erroneously admitted, there was sufficient other evidence to uphold the conviction, and the admission of the testimony was at most cumulative, and, therefore, harmless.</SPAN></P>

During a search pursuant to a warrant, a facemask was found that was not listed in the warrant. Defendant's motion to suppress the items was denied. At trial, two witnesses testified that they were present when defendant burglarized the store. Defendant was not allowed to impeach them with prior inconsistent statements given by them at a secret John Doe hearing, where they had stated they were not present. Defendant was convicted and he appealed. The supreme court first ruled that the girlfriend had authority to consent to the search and defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of the envelope. The facemask was admissible because it was found during a lawful search. Reversal was required, however, because defendant had a fundamental due process right to impeach the witnesses' credibility with their prior inconsistent statements, notwithstanding the secrecy provisions of Wis.

Although the information appeared to emphasize the fraudulent obtaining of the money rather than the fraudulent failure to report a change in the originally stated facts, any defect was one of form and was waived by the lack of a timely objection. The court also rejected defendant's contentions that there was no proof that the facts originally stated showed that the husband was not living at home and that there was no evidence to support the charge that defendant received public assistance for herself. The court observed that a statement submitted without objection showed the husband as living at a separate address. There was also evidence that defendant received funds for herself within the meaning of Wis. Stat. &sect; 49.19 (1)(c) where part of the aid was for payment of her mortgage. Wis. Stat. &sect; 49.12 (9) was not vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The purchaser refused to purchase the Authority's bonds, and claimed that the Authority was not valid under the laws of the state. The Authority applied for funds from the Secretary, who denied funds, and claimed that the Authority was unconstitutional. The state sought a declaratory judgment that the statute which created it, Wis. Stat. &sect; 234, was constitutional. The court held that the statute was for a proper state purpose. The court held that the statute did not violate: (1) Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7(2)(d), because it did not authorize construction of a structure for state use; (2) Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 2-4, because it created no binding obligation on the state nor contemplated the use of state monies; (3) Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 10, because it was not an internal improvement; (4) Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, because the tax exempt status was for a public purpose; (5) Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1, because it was not an illegal delegation of legislative power; or (6) Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 31-32 because it was not a special or private law. The court held that Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a county board of adjustment and a town, sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), that reversed the board's decision and held that a therapeutic home, in which not more than five emotionally disturbed children resided, owned by respondent foreign corporation, qualified as a single family dwelling under Dane County, Wis., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 10.01(18)(a) and required no site approval.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation intended to build and lease residences for use as therapeutic homes that provided care for disturbed children. The board of adjustment concluded that site approval was required, finding that such homes were not within the intended meaning of a &quot;single family dwelling&quot; found in &sect; 10.10(18)(a). On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment that reversed the board's decision. The court held that the trial court did not exceed its jurisdictional scope of review by certiorari. Pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.9(13) the trial court was entitled to take additional evidence and make additional findings of fact and conclusions of law. However, the trial court erred by concluding as a matter of law that the homes qualified as single family dwelling units. Considering the corporation's commercial purpose and finding that a concentration of such homes in one area was much the same as an institutional complex, the court held that the use and occupancy of the homes defeated the intent of Dane County Wis., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 10.01(18)(a) and disregarded the limitations imposed by the express words of &sect; 10.01(18)(a), &quot;occupied exclusively as a residence for one family.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the action with directions to affirm the board of adjustment's decision, which held that the corporation was required to obtain site approval.</SPAN></P>

In his petition for an injunction or an alternate writ of mandamus, the prisoner contended that the actions of both Illinois and Wisconsin officials resulted in his being denied a speedy trial. The prisoner argued that the Wisconsin prison officials were required to make efforts to insure that he was advised of his right to demand a speedy trial and were required to take steps to enforce such rights as dismissing detainers when the Act was not complied with by Illinois. The court denied the prisoner's petition, holding that the courts of Wisconsin, as the asylum state, was precluded from determining whether the 180-day rule or other constitutional rights under the Act were violated pursuant to art. III(d) of the Act. Also, the detainer was improperly lodged y the Chicago police department rather than the Illinois state's attorney for Cook County, Illinois, the court found that the procedural error did not prejudice any of the prisoner's fundamental rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff corporation appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) which concluded plaintiff failed to prove any special damages in an action for replevin to gain possession of machines and for damages against intervenor creditor for wrongful detention of the machines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff sought replevin for possession of machines it returned to defendant for alterations and for damages against intervenor for their wrongful detention. Intervenor claimed the return of the machines revested title in defendant, and made them subject to its claims. Upon review, the court found plaintiff obtained title to the six-coil winder when it was shipped from defendant and took the machine free of intervenor's security interest. However, with respect to the three, twelve-coil winders, intervenor had perfected a valid security interest in defendant's inventory, which included the twelve-coil winders; thus, plaintiff 's possession of the goods was subject to intervenor's security interest. The trial court properly determined the sum which plaintiff was obligated to pay over to intervenor in lieu of the return of the goods. Although plaintiff was entitled to replevin of the six-coil winder and the cell inserter, plaintiff failed to prove any special damages and was thus entitled to nominal damages only. Accordingly, judgment was reversed in part and affirmed in part and cause remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was declared a sexual deviant pursuant to the Law in an initial commitment proceeding and in a renewal commitment proceeding.

Stat. &sect; 51. The court held that with respect to recommitment proceedings: (1) the Law and the Act were similar in purpose and scope because they both contemplated the treatment and protection of the individual and the community from danger; (2) the judicial determinations of sex deviancy and mental illness or deficiency were so similar that a reasonable basis or justification for the lack of a jury determination under the Law was necessary; and (3) the State failed to offer a justification for the denial of a jury demand under the Law. With regard to the initial commitment proceeding, the court held that petitioner was unconstitutionally deprived of a jury trial on the question of his sexual deviancy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State's principal witness was an accomplice in the robbery. He testified that he was with a group of men, including defendant, who were planning to rob a tavern. Defendant and the witness went into the tavern and then returned to the group to report what they had observed. Defendant handed a gun to one member of the group. Three members of the group then entered the tavern with masks on, robbed the patrons, and took money from the cash register and safe. Afterward, the group travelled to another state and divided the money. On appeal, the court held that the evidence supported defendant's conviction for being a party to a masked armed robbery. Based on the record, an inference could be drawn that defendant had cased the tavern. Defendant also argued that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing a 17-year sentence. The court disagree and found that it was impossible to determine what if any rights of defendant were particularly violated where the trial court did not rely on the defendant's juvenile record to impose the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant vocational, technical, and adult education district (VOC) sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Brown County (Wisconsin), which held that respondent metropolitan sewage district (MET) could collect a sewerage service charge from VOC.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">VOC argued that MET could not collect a sewerage charge from VOC because VOC was neither a &quot;municipality&quot; nor an &quot;institution&quot; under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.208(2)(a). VOC contended that although the city could be charged for sewerage, and the city could collect the charge from VOC pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.076(4), MET had no authority to directly impose the charge. The court agreed. It reasoned that VOC was a school district, not a city, village, or town. Although school districts had been referred to as municipalities upon occasion, the fact that VOC was a municipal corporation did not make it a municipality. Nor was any authority cited to support MET's position that VOC was an &quot;institution.&quot; The court also rejected MET's argument that it had authority to directly impose a service charge pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 66.076(1),(4). It agreed with VOC's contention that the lack of a sewerage service charge provision in the lease agreement between the city and VOC exonerated VOC from paying such service charges to MET, stressing that pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 38.155(4m)(a), the city's obligations remained the responsibility of the city unless it transferred them to VOC in an agreement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An attorney commenced an original action in federal court that sought an injunction under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 against respondent judge of the Racine County Court (Wisconsin). Respondent ordered petitioner, a federal court judge, to show cause why he should not desist from interfering with contempt proceeding against the attorney in a divorce action. The federal judge filed a petition for a writ of prohibition to remove the order to show cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The majority of the court viewed the federal judge's application for a writ of prohibition under the court's superintending power as presenting a very narrow issue. The narrow issue was whether respondent could ignore the removal of his order requiring the federal judge to show cause why he should not desist from interfering with the contempt proceeding in the divorce case, because he believed the federal removal statute,&nbsp;28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1446(e), was unconstitutional. The court stated that respondent could not decide the constitutionality of &sect; 1446(e) in any case now pending before him or ignore the section because of his personal belief that it was unconstitutional. Whether the removal had merit or not was a question to be determined by the federal court of the eastern district of Wisconsin on the motion to remand, and respondent could not require the federal judge to appear in his court to show cause why he should not desist from interfering with the jurisdiction of the county court until the question has been decided. On the narrow facts presented, the federal judge's petition for a writ of prohibition had merit.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the statute was valid. The court held that: (1) &sect; 66.521 served a public purpose by promoting the general welfare of the state and placing the state in a competitive position with other states exercising similar statutes; (2) the powers delegated to the state were not unlawful because they did not conflict, but merely complimented the state legislation; and (3) although the state was constitutionally restricted from giving credit or incurring indebtedness, such did not occur in the instant case because the credit of the city was not the credit of the state, and neither was its indebtedness.</SPAN></P>

Defendant could not dictate the terms of probation and was not allowed to strike a bargain with the prosecutor or the court on the matter of restitution as a condition of probation.

The issue agreed was whether the school board's policy, which required a child to reach his fifth birthday prior to September 1st of the school year for admittance to kindergarten, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child was refused admission to kindergarten on the grounds of her age and of early admission tests which showed her to be too immature to qualify under an exception to the age policy. The school board contended that because the establishment of a kindergarten was not mandatory and it had a right to make to set a minimum-age limit for admittance. The parent argued that the school board's policy was contrary to Wis. Const. art. X, &sect; 3. The court held that there was no requirement that a child must graduate from kindergarten to be admitted to first grade. Education was for all children and if a child was excluded because of immaturity or other reasons, his educational needs must be otherwise provided for by the state. The court noted that under the present scheme, the age-admission date for first grade is six years old by December 1st of the school year. A September 1st admission date for kindergarten would require a child who becomes five years of age after September 1st but before December 1st to defer his education for one year or to enter first grade without the benefit of having attended kindergarten.</SPAN></P>

The court on appeal, however, found that Ohio law should apply to the dispute because the coemployees established their relationship in Ohio, because the Ohio insurer anticipated that Ohio law would govern the policy, and because Wisconsin had no substantial governmental interest to protect in determining whether an Ohio injured party should be able to seek damages from his coemployee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action for declaratory relief brought by respondent town, appellant county challenged an order from the Circuit Court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin), which overruled the county's demurrer to the town's complaint. The complaint alleged that the county passed a floodlands and shoreland zoning ordinance, which was arbitrary, capricious, inequitable, confiscatory, unconstitutional, illegal, and seriously affected the town's tax base.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Contrary to the county's assertion, the town had standing to bring a suit for declaratory relief under Wis. Stat. &sect; 269.56 to test the constitutionality of a county ordinance, but in the town's case, such a cause of action was not properly pleaded. A copy of the ordinance was not attached to or made a part of the complaint. The town seemed to claim that the ordinance in question was a sanitary code enacted under Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.07 (51), while the county claimed the ordinance passed was enacted under Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.971. The statutory relationship of the town and the city differed under the two sections relied upon by the parties. The court recognized that a complaint, when attacked by demurrer, was to be liberally construed and upheld if it expressly or by reasonable inference stated any cause of action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of judgments and orders of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) made in connection with his 1970 conviction for use of heroin in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.02(3) (1969) and his conviction under an instrument that charged him with possessing obscene material with the intent to sell in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.21(1)(a) (1969).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Regarding the obscenity conviction, which was rendered after a bench trial, defendant's sole challenge was to the trial court's determination that the subject magazine was obscene. The court refused to rule that the magazine was not obscene as a matter of law. For materials to be obscene, the dominant theme of the materials, taken as a whole, were required to appeal to a prurient interest in sex; be patently offensive to contemporary community standards that related to the description or representation of sexual matters; and be utterly without redeeming social value. Because reasonable minds could differ on the issue, the court declined to rule as a matter of law that the magazine in the case sub judice was not obscene; the issue was a factual one to be resolved by the fact-finder. Regarding defendant's conviction for heroin use, the court refused to rule on the defense argument that the conviction of an addict for using narcotics under the compulsion of a disease was unconstitutional. Significant to the court was the fact that, inter alia, there was no medical evidence to show the nature of defendant's addiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">By the Court</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  -- Habeas corpus granted to the petitioner and the respondent ordered to release petitioner on or before sixty days from this order unless respondent, within such time, commences civil commitment procedures for the commitment of petitioner under the provisions of ch. 51, Stats.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action for writ of habeas corpus, petitioner patient argued that he had been denied the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions by being committed to a state hospital without a jury determination of his competency to stand trial. The patient claimed entitlement to proceedings similar to those prescribed by Wis. Stat. ch. 51 for civil mental commitments to determine whether he should remain committed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient's equal protection argument was based on the theory that the jury trial afforded by the civil commitment statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. ch. 51, had to be made available to the patient, who was committed under Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.14. The court disagreed. The procedure provided under Wis. Stat. &sect; 51.03 was for a permanent commitment, whereas Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.14 contemplated a commitment of a temporary nature for so long as the incompetent condition endured. The purpose of Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.14 was to maximize the rights afforded criminally accused persons by stopping the criminal process. That rational basis for the distinction between the two procedures led the court to conclude that there was no basis for a claim of denial of equal protection. Conversely, the court held that a summary hearing pursuant to &sect; 971.14(4), where a psychiatric report was unchallenged, as was so in the instant case, was insufficient to meet the &quot;meaningful hearing&quot; requirements of the due process clause because &sect; 971.14(4) allowed only the district attorney and the patient's counsel, but not the patient, to contest a medical report and thereby bring about a fuller hearing on the merits of the competency issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Habeas corpus was granted to the patient and the patient's release from the state hospital was ordered to occur on or before 60 days from the order unless within such time, civil commitment procedures were commenced for the commitment of the patient under the statutory provisions for civil mental commitments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation filed a declaratory action seeking a judgment that &sect; 71.227(1) was unconstitutional. The trial court declared the tax statute unconstitutional based on the alleged denial of equal protection to the corporation when the taxation was determined by a classification that was proportional to the non-residency of its stockholders. On appeal, the court determined that in any particular liquidation, it was apparent that the impact of the tax fell heavily upon a Wisconsin resident and that out-of-state resident might have been taxed by the jurisdiction of his residence, but the impact of &sect; 71.227(1) fell heaviest on the local resident. The court found that under the statute, domestic and foreign corporations were treated identically and was constitutional and did not violate the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution. The court reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As police approached defendant, defendant dropped a container and attempted to walk away to avoid contact with the police.

Defendant was charged with and convicted of marijuana possession. He filed a motion for a new trial and, after his motion was denied, filed an appeal. In affirming, the court concluded that probable cause existed for placing defendant under arrest. The time and place, the dropping of the capsule, and defendant's attempted flight to avoid contact with the police combined to make the arrest reasonable. Further, the custodial search was reasonable. The bulge could have been a concealed weapon, and the police were entitled to conduct a weapons search for the purpose of their own protection. That the search revealed drugs and not a weapon did not render the search invalid or the drugs inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.20(8) permitted 50 percent of the fines in motor vehicle cases to be retained by the county. The commissioners challenged the validity of the statute in light of Wis. Const. art. X, &sect; 2, which provided that the &quot;clear proceeds&quot; of all fines collected for breaches of the penal laws should be set apart as a separate school fund and that the portion retained by the county was excessive. The court held that although the legislature clearly had the authority to determine the meaning and application of &quot;clear proceeds&quot; and to determine the portion of fines retained by the county, the amount left to the school fund could not be merely nominal and the amount retained by the county could not be for any purpose other than reimbursement of the expense of prosecuting the offense that generated the fines. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the county, even though it retained 50 percent of the fines at issue, lost money in prosecuting the cases. Wis.

He argued that his equal protection rights were violated when he was arrested for being indigent. The trial court held that the statutes that allowed the judge to issue a warrant for failure to pay his fine were constitutional. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.05(1) was constitutional. The court stated that in cases involving traffic offenses the fine was reasonable and the section did not provide for any automatic conversion to imprisonment. The court also held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.07 was constitutional, as the trial court found. The court noted that the section also did not automatically require imprisonment for the failure to pay a fine. The court determined that defendant, when given a period of time in which to pay a fine had the burden to apply to the court for relief, if he was unable to pay within the given time. The court concluded that lacking such an application by defendant, the lower court was justified &sect; 973.07 in imprisoning defendant as a collection method. However, the court held that a hearing should have been held to determine defendant's ability to pay the fine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Secretary made a determination adverse to the taxpayers and the circuit court denied jurisdiction to hear their appeal. They appealed and the court affirmed, holding that it had jurisdiction because although the taxpayers appealed from the judgment and not the order sustaining the demurrer, the order could be reviewed under the provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 274.34. The commission had authority to hold declaratory proceedings arising from a determination by the Secretary that the provisions of the selective retail sales tax, Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.52, were applicable to the taxpayers' business, as the determination adversely affected them. Wis. Stat. &sect; 296.56 gave the circuit court concurrent jurisdiction with the commission over issues arising under the tax laws; therefore, the circuit court and the commission had concurrent jurisdiction to determine all questions of law and fact. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in declining jurisdiction, as the taxpayers did not attempt to show any valid reason for intervention by the circuit court and uniform application of the tax laws was a necessary goal such that the circuit court properly did not interject itself into the process.</SPAN></P>

The probation officer determined that each juvenile should be detained until his case was heard on the merits. A juvenile court judge, who did not hear the evidence or read the transcript of the hearings, signed orders authorizing the continued detentions of the juveniles. The court held that the procedure was not proper. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.29(2), a juvenile court judge could authorize a social worker such as the probation officer to order the detention of a juvenile beyond 24 hours, but only due to the unreasonableness of the hour or because it was a Sunday or a holiday and it was impracticable to obtain a written order from a juvenile court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner prisoner appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which dismissed his petition for a writ of mandamus to require respondents, the Secretary of the Department of Health &amp; Social Services, the head of the Division of Corrections, and the warden of the state prison (state officials) to make a determination of the adequacy of the prisoner's medical treatment and to enjoin them from interfering with his mail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner alleged that he suffered from an ailment, but the prison doctor did nothing to help him, nor did the prisoner receive a physical examination. He filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, but the trial court dismissed the petition. On appeal, the court reversed the order and directed the trial court to order the state officials to file a return on the merits. The court found that a writ should issue requiring the state officials to make a determination of the adequacy of the prisoner's medical treatment, if they had not already done so, and to justify the prison rule forbidding a prisoner to communicate by mail with the Veterans Administration. The possible administrative remedies under Wis. Stat. &sect; 227 did not preclude a resort to mandamus. Because the Department was statutorily required to exercise its discretion concerning the adequacy of the health treatment and care of an inmate, mandamus would compel the exercise of that discretion. The refusal to mail the prisoner's letter to the Veterans Administration was an interference with his constitutional rights, and the inmate was entitled to an injunction restraining the state officials from interfering with such mail.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of violating Wis. Stat. &sect; 946.80, a statute prohibiting misconduct on public grounds. On appeal, defendant raised the issue that the statute was unconstitutional because it is vague and overbroad. The court held that the constitutional issue was controlling and agreed with defendant that the statute was unconstitutional. The court noted that the First Amendment rights of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and right to petition for grievance were implicated by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibition against state abridgment of privileges or immunities and that the lack of fair notice was implicated because of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court reversed the judgment and order of the trial court. The court concluded that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it did not give reasonable notice to reasonable persons of the acts it sought to prohibit and make criminal and that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad because it invaded the area of protected freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant village sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin) for respondent State of Wisconsin on behalf of respondent property subdivider, finding that the village's nonaction on the preliminary plat submitted by the subdivider constituted approval pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 236.11(1)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The village contended that the trial court erred in ruling that the village's failure to take action on the subdivider's preliminary plat within the 40-day period required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 236.11(1)(a) resulted in constructive approval of the preliminary plat because the plat violated the village's official map. On review, the court held that &sect; 236.11(1)(a) clearly indicated that the failure of the village to approve, conditionally approve, or reject the preliminary plat within 40 days and to notify the subdivider in writing of its action within that period automatically resulted in an approval of the preliminary plat, whether or not the plat violated the village's official map or any municipal ordinance. The objection of the county planning commission to the plat was entered after the 20-day limitation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 236.12(3) and (6) and thus had no effect. The village's tabling of the plat was not such a definite action as to amount to a rejection of the plat because Wis. Stat. &sect; 236.11 required a written statement or notice of rejection be given to the subdivider within the 40-day period in order to give him an opportunity to cure objections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, the Attorney General of the State of Wisconsin, filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review of an order of respondent county court judge reducing the sentences of defendant for forcible robbery, causing great bodily harm, and forceful rape by a total of 25 years over 12 years after the sentences were imposed by another judge. On appeal, the attorney general asserted that the judge had no jurisdiction to enter the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was sentenced to 10 years for forceful robbery, 5 years for causing great bodily harm, and 30 years for forceful rape, to run consecutively for a total period of incarceration of not more than 45 years. Twelve years later, defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of the sentence, which was granted by the judge. The order modified defendant's sentence by reducing the rape sentence to 20 years and ordering that the sentences run concurrently. On appeal, the judge asserted that he had jurisdiction to modify the sentence under Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06, which provided a postconviction remedy for sentences which violated constitutional guarantees, arguing that the original sentence was excessive and constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that although &sect; 974.06 had no time limitation within which postconviction review might have been sought, the mere excessiveness of the sentence by the judge's standards could not apply to the sentences which had stood for 12 years. The court also noted that it was not inclined to entertain the writ because the issue of the sentences' excessive should have been brought up on appeal, but was not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his sentence from the Circuit Court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin) after conviction under Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.44(2), driving after his license was revoked. He contended that the statute did not preclude probation and that construction of the statute to deny probation was an equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the trial court erred by finding that &sect; 343.44(2) required a prison sentence and that he was not eligible for parole. He based his argument on the language of Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.09, which allowed a sentencing court to withhold or impose sentence and its execution, and/or place a defendant on probation. The court viewed the argument as one of statutory construction and applied the terms of Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.44(2) because it was more specific as opposed to the general provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.09. The court noted that generally, specific statutes controlled over general statutes. The provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.44(2), which stated that a sentencing court &quot;shall&quot; sentence such a defendant to jail time imposed a mandatory sentence, not within the discretion of the trial court. The court rejected defendant's equal protection challenge, noting that, while those convicted under &sect; 343.44(2) were treated differently than those convicted under other statutes, because there was a reasonable basis to justify the classification, the classification was not an equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rendered a judgment adverse to appellants. On appeal, appellants attacked the constitutionality of Wis.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the principal action was commenced five months before the statute of limitations expired. The court determined that appellants did not have standing to raise the constitutional question because &sect; 893.155 did not bar their action against the architect. The court found that appellants' inability to maintain the third-party action against the architect was the result of their delay and not the result of the bar of &sect; 893.155. The court refused to make any determination on the constitutionality of &sect; 893.155 as against appellants' claims of unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During a private counseling session with a social worker, defendant's wife stated that defendant had engaged in sexual relations with the couple's daughter. Defendant at first denied the accusation, then later admitted that the statement was true. After defendant stood accused of having taken &quot;indecent liberties&quot; with the child, the social worker resisted testifying about defendant's statements on ground of confidentiality. On defendant's appeal, the court held that because the conferences were not at the behest of a family court commissioner, Wis. Stat. &sect; 247.081, which would have conferred confidentiality, did not apply. The State was not estopped from using the inculpatory statements made to the social worker, whose promise of secrecy was not a bar to the entry of defendants' statements into evidence. The court refrained from holding that the trial court's admission into evidence of defendant's prior conviction for contributing to the delinquency of a minor constituted an abuse of discretion even though another trial court might have ruled differently because of remoteness. The crime occurred 18 years prior to the instant case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed a judgment and an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which convicted them of armed-masked robbery and denied their postconviction motions to set aside the convictions on the ground of lack of a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An armed-masked robbery was committed, and two years later, defendants were convicted of the crime. During that two-year period, defendants were in the federal system on federal charges. Upon their state convictions, defendants filed postconviction motions to set aside the convictions on the ground of lack of speedy trial. The trial court denied their motions, and defendants appealed. The court affirmed the judgment and order because the delay in trial was not unreasonable or prejudicial to defendants. Even though the trial occurred two years after the original charges were brought against defendants, it took place about eight and one-half months after defendants made a sufficient demand for a speedy trial. The court refused to apply the &quot;180-day rule&quot; in the interstate extradition statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 976.05(1), because it was not effective on the date of the trial. The delay was not caused by the prosecution; rather, defendants were confined in the federal jurisdiction and were pursuing postconviction remedies. Defendants were not prejudiced by the delay, and because of the seriousness of the crimes charged, the rights of the public demanded a trial and not a dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The beneficiaries, the mother and siblings of the decedent, were named in the will. A minor child claimed the estate of the decedent under the statutes regulating the descent and distribution of intestate estates. The child was represented by a court-appointed guardian ad litem, who signed the compromise agreement on behalf of the child. The trial court held that this representation by a court-appointed guardian ad litem was not compliance with the statute involved, and set aside the agreement. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that Wis. Stat. &sect; 318.31, allowing an estate's representative to &quot;adjust by compromise&quot; any controversies regarding the will, was constitutional. The court rejected the guardian's contention that no agreement under the will could be reached or approved until it was determined whether the deceased died testate or intestate. The court held that the statutory requirement of representation of the minor by a &quot;guardian&quot; was complied with by the participation and consent of the court-appointed guardian ad litem.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner claimed it was error to exclude proof of the amount paid by the state to the owner of other property, which had been condemned, it was error to not exclude the testimony of an appraiser called by the state when the appraiser's report was not given to the landowner until shortly before trial, and the jury instructions were erroneous on the burden of proof. The court affirmed the judgments. Prices paid for other lands by the state in settlement of condemnation proceedings should not be admitted into evidence. The court saw no reason to hold otherwise stating that because the price in a condemnation was not determined by an arms-length transaction but between one who had to buy and another who had no choice but to sell, evidence of sales of property subject to condemnation to the state was inadmissible. The landowner had five days in which to examine the appraiser's report and failed to show he was prejudiced by the admission of the testimony. The burden of proof in eminent domain proceedings on the question of damages was properly placed on the landowner. The landowner's failure to object to the jury instructions at trial constituted a waiver of the objection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner owned two tracts of land initially acquired by the federal government for the purpose of establishing an air force base. The board adopted a resolution of necessity to condemn the landowner's interest in the land, and after employing appraisers to determine the highest and best use of the land, the board made an offer, which the landowner rejected, and the board adopted a formal resolution for condemnation. After a hearing before the state conservation commission, the landowner was awarded a sum for the tract he held in fee and nothing for his option rights in the other tract. The landowner appealed, and the circuit court affirmed. The landowner sought further review, and the court affirmed, holding that the progress already begun on surrounding lands in establishing a wildlife refuge and public recreation facilities provided a reasonable basis for the board's finding of necessity to condemn the landowner's land for conservation purposes. The court determined that there was no unauthorized delegation of authority by the board or any others which usurped the powers vested solely in the board and that it acted in good faith in negotiating with the landowner.</SPAN></P>

Once in their new home, the couple applied for and received general welfare because they were unable to secure employment. Because the couple's legal place of settlement was the town, the town had to pay for the general relief the couple received. The town therefore petitioned to have the couple relocated to the town, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 49.09, where the couple would be able to find work. The trial court granted the petition and the couple appealed. The court affirmed. The court found that the statutory classification in the instant case was neither suspect nor infringed upon a fundamental right but was reasonably related to the very purpose of general assistance. There was no invidious discrimination; benefits were not denied on the basis of residency, i.e., whether or not a legal settlement had been established. Regardless of legal settlement, eligible dependents were entitled to assistance. Therefore, the statute did not run afoul of the equal protection clause. The couple had the choice of staying in the city and not receiving benefits or going back to the town.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the statute would have the impermissible effect of a final order until there was a final adjudication upon merits which also would have been admissible in evidence in a subsequent criminal proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff injured party appealed from a decision of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which overruled his demurrer to the amended answer filed by defendant foreign corporation. The foreign corporation cross-appealed from an order granting the injured party's motion that service of process was valid and that there was jurisdiction over the foreign corporation and from an order denying the foreign corporation's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The foreign corporation did not have a certificate of authority to do business in Wisconsin. Consequently, a summons and complaint were served on the Secretary of State of the State of Wisconsin, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 180.847(4), on the foreign corporation at its last known address, and on the last known president of the company, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 262.06(5). The foreign corporation challenged jurisdiction. The reviewing court found that the pivotal issue as to the status of the foreign corporation as it related to the date of the injury was never resolved in the manner prescribed by statute and the case law of Wisconsin. The court found that the status of the corporation was essential in determining the issue of jurisdiction, and that it could not be determined from the record. Accordingly, the court held that a jurisdictional trial was necessary on remand. The initial issue to be determined was the date of the alleged dissolution of the foreign corporation. The court found that the trial court properly denied the injured party's demurrer to the foreign corporation's amended answer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order overruling the injured party's demurrer to the amended answer was affirmed. The order granting the injured party's motion that service of process was valid and that there was jurisdiction over the machine corporation and the order denying the machine corporation's motion to dismiss were reversed. The cause was remanded for a jurisdictional trial of the issue of whether the machine corporation was dissolved under Illinois laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant property owner sought review of a judgment and an order from the Circuit Court for Outagamie County (Wisconsin) rendered in favor of respondent City of Appleton, Wisconsin. The property owner contended that if Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.05 could not be construed to give her a right to repair when her buildings could be made safe by such repairs, then &sect; 66.05 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that if the cost of repairs to the buildings were unreasonable, the building inspector could order the buildings razed with no option to the owner, but he could give the owner the option to repair rather than raze only if the property could be made safe by repairs that were reasonable in cost. The owner argued that the other possible interpretation of &sect; 66.05(1)(a) was that if a building could be made safe by repairs, whether reasonable in cost or not, the owner was entitled to the option of repairing. In upholding the judgment and order of the trial court, the court construed &sect; 66.05 to promote its purpose, which was to protect the public from exposure to the evils caused by seriously deteriorated buildings. The court looked to other jurisdictions as well as the legislative history in reaching its conclusion. The court construed &sect; 66.05 to mean that if the repairs to a building were unreasonable, the building had to be razed even though it could be made safe by the expenditure of unreasonable cost of repairs. Section 66.05 was not unconstitutional simply because it prohibited unreasonable or impractical repairs or substantial rebuilding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff mortgagee appealed a judgment of the County Court of Brown County (Wisconsin) in its suit against defendant wife in her capacity as administratrix of her deceased husband's estate and as cosigner of a promissory note and chattel mortgage, arguing that the trial court erred in excluding testimony regarding the husband's statements under the dead man's statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 885.16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During the husband's lifetime, the husband and wife purchased a combine from an equipment dealer under a conditional sales contract. The husband subsequently returned the combine to the dealer. The purchase of the combine had been secured by a chattel mortgage, and when the husband and wife failed to make payments, the mortgagee filed suit upon the promissory note. At trial, the trial court excluded the testimony of the dealer regarding what took place when the husband, now deceased, returned the combine. After an adverse verdict was rendered, the mortgagee appealed, contending that the dead man's statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 885.16, did not bar the dealer's testimony regarding his conversation with the deceased husband. In reversing and remanding for a new trial, the court concluded that, because the wife was being sued not only as the administratrix of her husband's estate but as a cosigner of the note, her liability did not come through her husband, and the dead man's statute was thus unavailable to her. As against the wife as cosigner, the testimony concerning what transpired at the returning of the combine to the retailer should have been admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a declaratory judgment action, petitioners challenged the constitutionality of the provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 121.54(4) and 121.54(2)(b)1 that allowed the transportation of private students at public expense on an attendance area basis but disallowed such state-paid transportation for two private schools in one attendance area if the schools were of the same religious denomination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners contended that the statute, which implemented an amendment to the state constitution allowing for transportation of students to and from private schools at taxpayer expense, was unconstitutional. They argued that it discriminated against religiously affiliated schools in prohibiting transportation where there was overlapping of schools of the same denomination. However, no such ban was placed on private, secular schools. The court applied the statutory construction rule that preferred an interpretation of a statute that prevented its being struck down as unconstitutional. The court ruled, therefore, that the statute forbade overlapping as to all private schools affiliated or operated by a single sponsoring group, whether such school operating agency or corporation was secular or religious. Thus construed, the court held, the statute met all constitutional requirements. Moreover, its construction rendered the statutory phrase &quot;affiliated with the same religious denomination&quot; as the test of affiliation in a single school system rather than operation by a single agency or set of trustees or religious order within a particular religious denomination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court upheld the constitutionality of the challenged statute.</SPAN></P>

An accompanying news story stated that the police department had arrested a photographer of the newspaper for possession of similar pictures. There was also a sex poem that wandered through poetry on two pages of the newspaper. At issue was whether the trial court used the proper test of obscenity and whether the material was obscene. In affirming, the court held that the pictures had to be considered in connection with the accompanying news article and that the poem had to be viewed alone but in its setting on the page. The court found both the poem and the pictures to be utterly without any redeeming social value or any social value that would justify their publication under contemporary community standards in Wisconsin. The material taken as a whole, as the court defined it, appealed to prurient interest in sex and was offensive and affronted current community standards of Wisconsin relating to the representation of sexual matters, and exploiting as it did the act of intercourse, went far beyond the candor that was accepted in such matters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff nonresident broker appealed an order of the County Court of Kenosha County (Wisconsin) denying its claim for a commission allegedly due for attempting to sell defendant owner's radio station in Wisconsin and rejecting its claim that Wis. Stat. &sect; 136, requiring the licensing of all brokers acting in Wisconsin, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The broker claimed it did not act as a real estate broker under &sect; 136 because no real estate was involved in the sale, and, that if it did, the statute unlawfully burdened interstate commerce. On appeal, the court affirmed. It could reasonably be inferred from the contract that the broker undertook to sell an entire business, putting its activities squarely within the definition of a business opportunity broker under &sect; 136.01. In addition, the broker failed to allege it was duly licensed when its claim arose. Therefore, its attempted brokerage contract was void, and it could not maintain an action to collect a commission. Section 136 was constitutional as a valid exercise of the state's police power to protect residents by regulating and licensing all real estate brokers. Although the radio station was in interstate commerce, it had incidents and required activities within the state intimately related to local welfare, which Congress had not preempted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the county court's order denying the broker a commission and upholding the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with violating the commercial gambling statute. The information alleged that he intentionally received bets or offers to bet with the facilities to do so. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The information charged defendant with the crime of which he was convicted. It was clear that he was being charged with engaging in commercial gambling by &quot;receiving, recording, or forwarding bets&quot; and by &quot;possessing the facilities to do so with the intent to so use them.&quot; Defendant was charged with one crime, and all the elements of both the alternative evidentiary routes to establishing it were spelled out. Measured by common understanding and practice, it gave adequate warning of the violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 945.03(2). It alleged both the receiving of bets and the possession of facilities to receive such bets with intent to so use them. The complaint was conjunctive, not disjunctive, setting forth the two ways the single crime could be, and allegedly was, committed.</SPAN></P>
