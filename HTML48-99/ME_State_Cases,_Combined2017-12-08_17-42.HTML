</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff challenged an order granting summary judgment in favor of defendant state agency, which moved to dismiss his action seeking to rescind his paternity acknowledgement. In a paternity suit earlier, plaintiff had submitted to a blood test that proved conclusively that he was the father. He acknowledged paternity and defendant terminated the paternity suit and commenced child support proceeding. Through a new attorney, plaintiff then disavowed acknowledgment of paternity and filed a complaint, arguing he was entitled to the 60-day window to rescind paternity under recently enacted statute. He also contended the paternity statute in effect during his paternity suit was unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed summary judgment because the newly enacted statute did not apply to a pending paternity proceeding, and plaintiff's constitutional challenge was unsubstantiated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of summary judgment was affirmed because the lower court committed no error in denying plaintiff's motion to rescind his acknowledgement of paternity, nor did it err in determining he was the father of the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After Maine enacted legislation that restructured the state's electricity industry and allowed citizens to choose to purchase services from competitive providers, respondent, the Public Utilities Commission, promulgated rules that required electric transmission and distribution facilities to file with respondent, prior to distribution, any educational materials the facilities planned to distribute to the public. Petitioner, an electric power company, challenged the rules on constitutional grounds. The court vacated the rule that required that educational materials be submitted prior to dissemination because it constituted an unconstitutional prior restraint on non-commercial core speech. The court upheld the rules' inclusion and correction requirements, because, while they were content-based restrictions on speech, they were narrowly tailored to serve the compelling interest in ensuring that the public receives accurate information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the pre-dissemination submission requirement of the Public Utilities Commission Rule because it constituted an unconstitutional prior restraint on core speech, upheld inclusion and correction requirements in the rule because, while they were content-based restriction on speech, they were narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest, and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, neighboring residents to a planned retirement community, appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Cumberland County, Maine, pursuant to Me. R. Civ. P. 80B, claiming that defendant town planning board had illegally approved defendant property developer's proposal, and that they were denied due process of law and other statutory rights by defendant town council when it considered and ultimately approved the proposal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant developer proposed building a retirement facility. The existing zoning ordinances would not have allowed all of the proposed facility to be placed on the subject property, so defendant developer sought a contract zoning agreement with defendant town. After multiple hearings, defendant planning board concluded that the contract zoning agreement was a reasonable use of the land and tentatively approved the planned subdivision, conditioned on the final approval of the proposed contract zoning by defendant town council and on the council's determination that the rezoning was consistent with the town's comprehensive plan. The town council ultimately gave final approval to the contract zoning. Plaintiffs, neighboring property owners, appealed the approval of the project and the contract zoning agreement. The court affirmed the approval of the development proposal and contract zoning finding no error in either the town council's or the planning board's finding that the proposed development was consistent with the town's comprehensive plan or in the lower court's rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an order approving defendant property developer's proposed retirement community where the court held that plaintiffs, who had been extensively involved in the hearing in review process, were not denied due process or an opportunity to be heard, and that there was no error in the lower court's finding that the approved property use was consistent with the town's comprehensive plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court, Penobscot County (Maine), that summarily dismissed his petition for post-conviction relief as untimely filed pursuant to a recent amendment to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 2128.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's sentence was the result of his guilty pleas to multiple criminal charges. Petitioner did not appeal his convictions or sentences. Instead, he filed a petition for post-conviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel twenty months after his guilty pleas. When petitioner entered his guilty pleas, the statute of limitations for petitions for post-conviction review was essentially a statutory application of the equitable doctrine of laches. In the intervening time between petitioner's guilty pleas and his application for post-conviction relief, the legislature enacted a new one-year period of limitation. The legislature enacted a grace period that gave prisoners who were convicted before the new limitation's effective date one year to file their petitions before the new limitation would be applied to them. Petitioner did not file for post-conviction relief until after the grace period expired. The court concluded that the one-year grace period avoided the possible deprivation of due process and that petitioner's rights were not violated by the application of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 2128 to his application for post-conviction review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment that summarily dismissed petition for post-conviction relief as untimely filed was affirmed. The court concluded that the one-year grace period in the amended statute was sufficient to resolve any potential due process problems related to its application to prisoners who were convicted prior to the amendment of the statute of limitations for post-conviction relief petitions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents alleged that the statute that excluded religious schools from receipt of state funds, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 20, &sect; 2951(2), violated the federal and state constitutions. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment, and the parents sought review. On appeal, the court concluded that the statute did not place a substantial burden on the free exercise of plaintiffs' religion and therefore did not violate the Free Exercise Clause of U.S. Const. amend. I. The court also found no support for the proposition that the Establishment Clause prevented Maine from refusing to fund religious schools. While the court acknowledged that there had been shifts in Establishment Clause jurisprudence since the enactment of the religious school exclusion in Maine's statute, the court concluded that the statute would have violated the Establishment Clause without the exclusion. Accordingly, the court affirmed the decision below.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was the owner an exotic dancing club. Appellant was granted a nude activity permit by appellee town after appellee enacted an ordinance regulating exotic dancing. Appellee subsequently revoked appellant's permit. Appellant thereafter filed a federal action against appellees, the town and its officials, that alleged they had violated several of his constitutional rights in revoking his permit. Appellant also sought to have the ordinance declared unconstitutional. The federal court granted summary judgment to appellees. While the appeal of the federal action was pending, appellant filed a state court action against the same appellees. The state action claimed that in enacting the ordinance and revoking his permit, appellees had breached good faith, made fraudulent and negligent misrepresentations, and slandered him. The court below granted appellees' motion to dismiss the action on res judicata grounds. That judgment was affirmed because the matters presented for decision in the state court action were founded upon the same transaction as the federal action, arose out of the same nucleus of operative facts, and sought redress for essentially the same wrong.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state trial court's dismissal of appellant's action against appellees on the grounds of res judicata was affirmed because the matters presented for decision were founded upon the same aggregate of connected operative facts of an earlier federal action filed by claimant against appellees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher was hired as a probationary science teacher at the school.

The principal recommended that the teacher not be rehired. The trial court found the principal, but not the superintendent or the school committee, liable under the Act. The court modified the judgment and found that none of the defendants were liable. The court ruled that the teacher was not entitled to a jury trial on her claims because her claims under the Act sounded in equity. The court also held that although the principal and superintendent were agents of the committee, they were not liable under the Act because the teacher did not prove a causal connection between her not being rehired and her reporting the ventilation problems nor did she prove that the superintendent recommended the elimination of the science position in order to specifically eliminate the teacher from teaching at the school.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the proponents argued that the secretary failed to comply with the constitutional requirements of residency and voter registration and violated their right to free speech. The court held that requiring the circulators to be residents would not limit the size of the audience the proponents could reach. The proponents had three years to gather the necessary signatures and failed to demonstrate any necessity for employing nonresidents in circulating the petitions. Any interference with the proponents' right to unfettered political expression was justified by the state's compelling interest in protecting the integrity of the initiative process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company purchased a parcel of land in a rural district of the town and, three years later, applied for a permit to extract material from the parcel. In the interim, the town passed the ordinance, which prohibited ledge mining of more than 5000 cubic yards, measured in place, in any 12-month period in all districts within the town. The town planning board and board of appeals both denied the application. The company filed an action against the town, and summary judgment was granted to the town. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that the trial court should have dismissed the action because the company failed to serve a copy of the proceeding to the attorney general. The court decided to address the case on the merits anyway. The court determined that the stated purposes of the planning ordinance were legitimate objectives of the exercise of the town's police powers. The court found that the company did not meet its burden of establishing that the ordinance was unduly arbitrary or capricious. The court noted that the prohibitions on commercial extraction in effect before the company acquired the land were more restrictive than the disputed ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners challenged the village's voting procedures, which allowed those who owned property in the village to vote at annual meetings regardless of whether they were residents. The trial court held that the village was not subject to the voter qualification requirements of &sect; 111 and, therefore, nonresidents had the right to vote at annual meetings. The trial court further held that the property owners failed to prove that the village tax practices were unconstitutional. On appeal, the property owners contended that the village was a municipality under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30-A, &sect; 2501 (1996) and, therefore, its voter qualifications were governed by Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, &sect; 111. The court disagreed and affirmed. The legislature intended that village charters governed voter qualifications for village elections. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, &sect; 1(27) (1993) defined the term &quot;municipality&quot; as a city, town or plantation. Village residents were the primary recipients of the public improvements funded by the tax.

The trial court affirmed the Secretary's decision to invalidate the signatures, and the taxpayer sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The Secretary was justified in invalidating some of the signatures because the seven circulators presented affidavits that they did not take an oath in the presence of the notary public whose signature appeared on the petitions, as required by Me. Const. art. IV, pt. 3, &sect; 20. In addition, the Secretary properly invalidated 365 signatures because the signatures did not appear on the approved petition form.

The trial court granted the town's motion for summary judgment of the owner's claim, and the owner sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the town had the authority to regulate the daysailers' parking based upon two of the town's properly enacted ordinances. The business owner failed to raise any genuine issue of material fact concerning whether his equal protection rights were being violated, therefore, the trial court properly granted summary judgment on the equal protection claim to the town.

The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that there was an incompatibility between the federal standard for assistance of counsel and the Maine standard. The court adopted the federal standard, and held that an indigent defendant was entitled to counsel only when imprisonment would actually be imposed, not when there was a mere threat of imprisonment. The court held that the use of the uncounseled offense to enhance the current offense did not alter in any way the punishment for the initial offense. The court held that the sentencing court should be able to consider a wide range of evidence, including prior uncounseled offenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, town government and its officials, appealed a summary judgment entered in the Superior Court, Cumberland County (Maine) in favor of plaintiff camp operator, which had sought refunds of property taxes paid for 1989, 1990, and 1991. The camp operator cross-appealed from the dismissal of its claim for relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal was on remand from the United States Supreme Court, which had ruled the statute under which the camp operator was taxed, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 652(1)(A)(1), was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the denial of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 relief; the camp operator's legal remedy was not inadequate simply because it had to seek appellate review of its constitutional claim to secure it. Because no &sect; 1983 relief was available, attorneys' fees could not be awarded under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The camp operator's claim for a refund of its 1989 property taxes was barred by res judicata. The camp operator had unsuccessfully challenged the 1989 taxes in an earlier proceeding, naming the town as defendant. The instant action was against identical parties, the town officials in their official capacities, and adding a constitutional claim, which could have been brought in the earlier proceeding, amounted to splitting the cause of action. Collateral estoppel did not bar the camp operator's action for a refund of its 1990 taxes; that separate action was still pending. The camp operator was entitled to interest on overpaid taxes, with interest accruing from the date of overpayment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment to strike the order of a refund of the camp operator's 1989 taxes and affirmed the judgment as modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sought review of a decision from the Workers' Compensation Board (Maine) denying her petition for award of benefits on the determination that appellee employer was exempt from the requirement to secure the payment of compensation pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 39-A, &sect; 401(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured while working for the employer. The employee sought workers' compensation benefits, which were not carried by the employer. The employee challenged the denial before the board contending that it was erroneous. The board held that the employer was not required to carry such benefits because it fell within an exception outlined in Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 39-A, &sect; 401(1). The employee appealed the decision. The court noted that the employer fell squarely within the exception of &sect; 401(1) because it was a private employer engaged in agriculture, it did not employ more than six non-seasonal employees, and it maintained the required insurance coverage. Accordingly, the denial of benefits was proper. The employee also argued that the statute was unconstitutional in that it denied her due process rights. The court noted that since the statute did not implicate a suspect class or interfere with a fundamental right, the classification contained in the statute need only have been rationally related to a legitimate state interest. The statute met this requirement, and did not interfere with the employee's due process rights. The decision was correct.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the supreme judicial court held that the trial court acted within its discretion in permitting evidence of defendant's admissions to a police officer. Defendant contended that her motion for a judgment of acquittal should have been granted on the basis that the state had not met its burden of proof. The court held that defendant's constitutional challenge to the statute under which she was charged was without merit because she lacked standing to make the challenge in that her right to compulsory process was not involved in her failure to obey the subpoena in question. The court also held that there was extrinsic evidence, apart from her admissions, that she lacked reasonable cause in deciding not to testify at trial, and that the state met its burden under the corpus delicti rule. The court affirmed the judgment below.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court vacated the order and reinstated the visitation order because the challenge to the statute's constitutionality was not preserved. The court found that the trial court was entirely deprived of an opportunity of ruling on the issue of the statute's constitutionality because the mother raised the issue for the first time in an amended objection to an ancillary post-trial motion that subsequently was dismissed following her appeal of the underlying order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment entered in the Portland Administrative Court (Maine) that denied his petition for review and affirmed the Maine Real Estate Commission's decision that he violated Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 13067(1)(I)(2) (Supp. 1996) by permitting an agent to perform brokerage services for an agency for which she did not hold a license. Defendant argued that the Commission erred in concluding that he violated &sect; 13067.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission's Director advised defendant that the use of brokers licensed at his first agency to work as agents at his second agency would violate existing law because the Brokerage Act limited the issuance of licenses to no more than one per person for the same period of time. An agent licensed to work at defendant's first agency nevertheless listed properties for sale, conducted showings, prepared offers to purchase property, and pursued possible listings on behalf of the second agency. Defendant argued that he did not violate &sect; 10367 because the agent acted as a subagent of the second agency or pursuant to a co-brokerage agreement between the agencies. The court held that the Commission's conclusion that defendant violated &sect; 10367 by authorizing the agent to engage in brokerage services for the second agency when she did not hold a license authorizing her to do so was supported by the record and was not clearly erroneous. The weight and credibility of evidence that the agent believed she clearly told customers she worked for the first agency was properly left to the Commission, and the statutory terms &quot;subagent&quot; and &quot;co-brokerage&quot; were not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court properly instructed the jury that it must find beyond a reasonable doubt all of the facts necessary to prove each element of the offense charged. The trial court did not err in denying the requested instruction and denying the requested special jury verdict form because defendant was not entitled to a unanimous finding on the purpose for which he engaged in the sexual contact. The trial court did not exceed the bounds of its discretion in the manner in which it conducted a post-verdict voir dire, and the record revealed no evidence that any extraneous information reached the jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff unsuccessful candidate for public office appealed a decision of the Superior Court, Penobscot County (Maine), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant Secretary of State. The candidate alleged that the recount statute,&nbsp;Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, &sect; 737-A (Supp. 1996), violated his right to due process under the United States and Maine Constitutions in that it required that he deposit a certain sum to obtain a recount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate requested a recount and, pursuant to &sect; 737-A(1)(C), the Secretary's office advised him that he would be required to post a deposit of $ 1,000 for the recount to proceed. The candidate refused and filed suit asserting that the statute, as applied, violated the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Maine Constitutions. Because the election in which the candidate sought to participate had long passed, the court considered whether the candidate's appeal was moot. The court held that the case was not moot because the issue raised by the candidate was capable of repetition and would evade review if not addressed on the merits. The court further held that the statute passed constitutional scrutiny in that it was part of a comprehensive revision of the state election laws intended to restore public confidence in the electoral process by, inter alia, reducing the number of people handling the ballots and discouraging recounts that were frivolous and had little chance of success. The court found that these were legitimate legislative objectives related to the public welfare and that the manner in which the State exercised its power was not unduly arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the superior court in favor of the Secretary of State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought to admit two letters sent to his wife, the victim's mother, by her boyfriend. The trial court ruled that defendant could cross-examine witnesses based on the content of the letters but could not introduce the letters into evidence. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The court explained that the trial court's discretion to exclude evidence was limited by defendant's right to confront witnesses. The trial court did not abuse its discretion because defendant did not show a critical link between the letters and the witnesses' motive to lie, which could not be explored by questioning alone. The court also ruled that the evidence at trial did not fatally vary from the allegations in the indictment, although the indictment alleged sexual abuse at certain times in the victim's life and the evidence did not support the allegations. In the absence of the specificity provided by a bill of particulars, any temporal variance between the allegations of the indictment and proof at trial was not fatal to the conviction. The temporal variance did not failed to protect defendant from double jeopardy. The evidence was sufficient to sustain the convictions.</SPAN></P>

The other driver's license was administratively suspended based on his operation of a motor vehicle with an excessive level of blood alcohol. A trial court upheld the Secretary's decisions. On appeal, the drivers contended that the statutory changes relating to license suspensions were enacted unconstitutionally as emergency legislation. The court found that the preamble declared the existence of a fiscal emergency and the immediate necessity of the legislation as a response to that emergency. The court also found that the amendments to the operating under the influence (OUI) were revenue positive and included substantial increases in fines for violations of the OUI law. Therefore, the court held that the changes to the OUI laws were constitutionally enacted as part of emergency legislation and validly applied to the administrative suspensions imposed on the drivers.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the HGN test was an integral part of a police officer's administration of the field sobriety test, and the court took judicial notice of its reliability in making determinations of probable cause for arrest and for purposes of establishing criminal guilt in cases involving operating under the influence. It was also harmless error for the trial court to admit some of the HGN testimony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer sought to build a mobile home park on certain property. It was initially informed that it should be able to obtain permits for hookups to the town's sewer system, but a moratorium on permits was imposed when state and federal authorities determined that the system was not in compliance with licensing requirements. Thus, the developer was unable to obtain all the necessary permits. Consequently, it sued the town. The developer's claims were rejected and it appealed. In affirming, the supreme judicial court ruled that there was no common law right to available sewer capacity and the moratorium did not constitute an impermissible regulatory taking of property; rather, it was a reasonable exercise of the police power under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30-A, &sect; 3001 (1995). Consideration of the misrepresentation claim was precluded because the developer failed to comply with the notice of claim requirements under the Maine Tort Claims Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 8107(1). Also, the moratorium was facially neutral and no intentional discrimination was shown. Finally, the pleadings were insufficient to state a claim of promissory estoppel.</SPAN></P>

The woman told the officer that the manager was not available and that she guessed she was in charge. She directed the officer to a lobster tank. The officer found 16 undersized lobsters and cited defendant for possession of short lobsters. Defendant initially requested a jury trial and filed motion in a district court to suppress evidence and to dismiss the charge. The district denied both motions.

The trial court's conducted deprived the jury of information regarding the context in which the panel operated, which then precluded the jury from pursuing its fact-finding role.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed the order. The motel argued that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 38, &sect; 1252(7)(A)(2), did not allow the town to review issues peripherally related to land use controls contained in the plan, but rather limited the town's review to issues immediately related to the laying of sewer extension pipes. The court disagreed as the plain meaning of the statute was opposite. The motel next argued that the town exceeded its authority in denying written assurance based on concerns about the future capacity of the district's treatment plant. The court agreed with the town that provisions in both the plan and the statute enabled it to consider the remaining capacity of the district's treatment facility. The motel and the district argued that the town's decision was not supported by substantial evidence and was arbitrary and capricious. The court found that the town's conclusions were consistent with policies enumerated in the plan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the Director of the Bureau of Labor Standards and the State of Maine, brought an action pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 625-B (1988 &amp; Supp. 1996) (the severance pay statute) against defendant employer to recover severance pay for workers terminated by the employer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer contended the trial court erred in holding that a 1989 amendment to the statute was constitutional. The amendment, codified at Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 625-B(1)(C), changed the definition of an employer in the severance pay statute and was expressly made retroactive to October 1, 1975, the date on which the severance pay statute took effect. The employer argued that the retroactive application of the amendment violated, inter alia, the Due Process Clauses of the Constitutions of the State of Maine and the United States, Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 6-A and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, respectively, in that the amendment created a new obligation with retroactive application. The court affirmed, holding because that the legislature's avowed purpose in enacting the amendment was to clarify that a parent corporation was to be considered an &quot;employer&quot; for purposes of severance pay liability, a rational determination in furtherance of a legitimate legislative purpose, it was not violative of due process. Further, the court concluded that the amendment did not violate the Takings Clause or the Equal Protection Clause of either the Federal or State Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant insurers sought review of an order of the Superior Court of Kennebec County (Maine), which affirmed a decision of the Bureau of Insurance that ordered the insurer to pay an assessment made pursuant to the Maine Insurance Guaranty Association Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24-A, &sect;&sect; 4431-4452, as amended by 1989 Me. P.L. 1989, ch. 67. The insurers contended the amendments to the Act were being applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurers voluntarily terminated their licenses to write workers' compensation insurance in 1987. After that, they continued to pay assessments to the Maine Insurance Guaranty Association (MIGA) for insolvencies that occurred prior to their withdrawal. The 1989 amendments to the Act changed the calculation of assessments for withdrawn insurers. In 1994, MIGA made an additional assessment for 1991 after discovering that two of the insurers had not been assessed. On appeal, the court held that the amendment had not been applied retroactively. Pursuant to MIGA's plan of operation, which was binding on all insurers, the insurers' withdrawal did not change their legal status under the act; it did not affect the existence of their ongoing liability to MIGA for insolvencies that occurred while they were member insurers. The court held that the operation of the statute was prospective because it governed operative events that occurred after its effective date. The operative event was the need to make an assessment as a result of insolvency. If no claims from pre-1987 insolvencies had arisen, the amendments would not have applied to the insurers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on a complaint, the city's fire inspectors searched the owners' property for fire hazards. The owners claimed that the city was liable for the damages incurred during the search pursuant to &sect; 1983 because Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 25, &sect; 4682 (1996), which did not require a search warrant for the search, was unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 4682 was constitutional and, as a result, the owners were not entitled to any damages. The court reasoned that the city was not liable for damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because the inspectors had a reasonable good faith belief that their actions were within the sphere of their official responsibilities. Thus, they were using their discretion when they searched the property for fire hazards. Because the officers were performing their duties pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 25, &sect; 4682, they were not acting with malicious intent to cause a deprivation of the owners' constitutional rights and they were not acting unreasonably. Additionally, the city was not liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress because the inspectors' actions were not so extreme or outrageous to exceed all bounds of decency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a prison inmate who was serving the remainder of a sentence after a probation violation, was accused of having run his hand up the crotch of a female corrections officer. Prison authorities imposed 30 days of cell restriction on defendant and forfeited 30 days of good time credits. Criminal charges were also filed against defendant, who sought to have the indictment dismissed on double jeopardy grounds. After the superior court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment, defendant appealed. The court determined that the discipline meted out by prison authorities was remedial rather than retributive in nature and therefore did not constitute &quot;punishment&quot; for double jeopardy purposes. The prison authorities could restore any portion of the good time deducted if defendant's later conduct and outstanding effort warranted that restoration. The remedial purpose of promoting and maintaining good conduct in prison underlay the allowance and deduction of good time. The fact that defendant forfeited 30 days of &quot;up front&quot; good time credits did not alter the remedial purpose.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. tit. 29, &sect; 1312 (1992). The jury considered the result of a mandatory blood-alcohol test. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a professional truck driver hauling logs when he came upon a Maine Department of Transportation work site. Defendant slowed his truck as he approached the work site, but he did not obey the flagman's signal to stop. He proceeded southbound into a lane that was being traveled by northbound traffic. Defendant tried to avoid a collision by swerving to the right. As he attempted the maneuver, the truck rolled over, spilling the logs. One of the workers was crushed by the logs and killed. Because the accident involved a fatality, defendant was required to submit to a blood alcohol test. A few days after the accident, defendant told a police investigator that he had consumed about a fifth of whiskey on the night before the accident. The trial court considered this statement as probable cause independent of the blood test result. The court held that defendant's argument that the blood test results were inadmissible was without merit. There was competent evidence of independent probable cause. The interest of the State in preventing highway fatalities resulting from drunk drivers was compelling, and one involved in a fatal accident would expect an investigation.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, the trial court recommitted defendant to the Commissioner. On appeal, defendant asserted that Me. Rev. Stat.

The court held the trial court did not err in recommitting defendant to the Commissioner. Section 101-B(4)(A) permitted a defendant to be recommitted after the expiration of one year if there existed a substantial probability that the defendant would become competent in the foreseeable future.

On appeal, the court agreed and vacated the lower court's judgment. The court held that the rule applied when the company sold products from Maine in a state that did not have sufficient contact to subject the company to taxation in that state.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an audit, a state tax assessor found that a corporation should have included its foreign subsidiary dividends in its state tax returns. The corporation was required to pay taxes, interest, and penalties for the calendar years in which the dividends should have been included. The corporation sought review of the assessment. A trial court granted summary judgment to the corporation. On appeal, the court found that the assessor determined the corporation's liability through the &quot;Augusta Formula,&quot; which utilized a water's edge method and a worldwide combined method with foreign source dividends included in the corporation's apportionable business income. The court held that the assessor was not precluded from resorting to the worldwide combined reporting method, pursuant to the equitable apportionment provision of Me. Rev. Stat.

The court noted that opinions propounded pursuant to Me. Const. Art. VI, &sect; 3 were not binding decisions. The House asked if a certain initiated bill became law, would a section of the bill violated the constitutional principal that one Legislature may not bind future Legislatures. The court answered that the statute appeared to have been an improper means of amending the state constitution and such bill would not have been enforced by the courts against future Legislatures. The court answered the questions propounded by the House.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff entered into a contract to purchase a house.

The court held that plaintiff's challenge to the denial of the conditional use permit was moot because plaintiff no longer had any interest in the property for which it sought the conditional use permit. The court held that plaintiff had standing to challenge the amendment to the zoning ordinance because the amendment directly affected its ability to expand its business in the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee sought review of a decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission (Maine), which denied her petition for an award against defendant employer after it concluded that her injury fell within the so-called &quot;rideshare immunity&quot; that exempted injuries connected with employer-provided transportation &quot;to and from work&quot; from workers' compensation coverage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer provided off-premises parking located between one and two miles from the office and a shuttle-bus to transport employees between the parking area and the workplace. One day the employee caught her shoe on the edge of the bottom step of the shuttle-bus and injured her back and neck. The Commission determined that the employee was barred from recovering for her injury by the &quot;rideshare-immunity&quot; provision of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 39, &sect; 51(2) that exempted injuries connected with employer-provided transportation to and from work from workers' compensation coverage. On appeal, the employee argued that transportation between the work-place and the parking lot was not transportation to and from work as provided in the Workers' Compensation Act and that, because the purpose of the immunity was to promote energy conservation, there was no legislative intent to extend the immunity to injuries such as hers. Upon review, the court agreed with the employee. The shuttle-service bore no relation to energy conservation, and was not intended to assist employees in their commute to work. The sole function of the shuttle-service was to facilitate parking for employees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employees filed an action against defendants, employers, insurers, and the Maine Workers' Compensation Board, challenging the constitutionality of the &quot;pay without prejudice&quot; provision of the Workers' Compensation Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 39-A, &sect; 205(7), (9)(B)(1). The Kennebec County Superior Court (Maine) rendered a judgment for defendants based on a determination that the provision was constitutional and the employees appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees claimed that the &quot;pay without prejudice&quot; provision was unconstitutional because it allowed defendants to discontinue payments without a hearing in contravention of the Due Process Clause. The employees argued that they had a property interest in the continued receipt of the voluntary payments. The trial court's judgment finding the provision constitutional was upheld. The court determined that the employees did not acquire any property right in continued benefits when employers elected to make voluntary payments. Section 205 did not entitle the employees to payment of benefits in advance of a compensation award and did not prevent the employees from pursuing an award; because the early payments under &sect; 205 were only authorized at the employers' option and were completely voluntary, no property right was created. Therefore, the voluntary payments could be discontinued in the absence of a hearing without offending the Due Process Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed the decision of the Superior Court, York County (Maine), which affirmed a lower court's decision that bound him for trial as an adult under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 3102(4)(E) (1980, 1994) and convicted him of manslaughter pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 203 (1983, 1994). Defendant also appealed his sentence under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect;&sect; 2151-2157 (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A lower court bound a defendant accused of manslaughter under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 203 (1983 &amp; 1994) for trial as an adult under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 3102(4)(E) (1980, 1994). Defendant was convicted by the trial court and the court affirmed his conviction and sentence. The court held that defendant was properly bound for trial as an adult under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect;3101(4)(E) (1980, 1994) because there was probable cause to have believed that he committed manslaughter and a preponderance of the evidence suggested that his trial as an adult was appropriate because the crime was committed in a willful manner pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3101(4)(D)(1) (1980, 1994). The court also held that the standard of proof required for defendant's bind-over was not so low that it violated his due process rights. In reaching this decision, it looked at defendant's private interests, the possibility that defendant could have been deprived of those interests, and the governmental interest in the bind-over procedure. Further, the court found there was no abuse of discretion at sentencing under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect;&sect; 1151-1356 (1983, 1994).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of conviction entered after a jury trial in the Superior Court of Penobscot County (Maine). He was convicted of operating a motor vehicle with excessive blood-alcohol in violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 1312-B. 1.B. (Pamph. 1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal defendant contended that the State lacked probable cause to arrest him and urged that prosecutorial misconduct denied him a fair trial. The court found that there competent evidence in the record to support the finding of probable cause. Having stopped defendant, an ordinarily prudent and cautious officer, smelling liquor on defendant's breath for the second time in one evening and seeing his bloodshot glassy eyes, would have reason to require defendant to undergo field sobriety testing. The observations the officer made of defendant while he administered the four tests constituted probable cause to believe defendant had been operating under the influence and to take defendant into custody. Defendant argued that the State improperly referred to facts not in evidence when it made reference in its argument to the reliability of its Intoxilyzer instrument on the night it was used on defendant since the instrument was only checked weekly. The court found that, based on the testimony of an expert, it was permissible for the State to argue that the instrument's history supported an inference that the machine was reliable the night it was used to test defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that a hearing determining that his burglary charge was a formerly capital offense and therefore not eligible for bail was improperly held, excessive bail was set for certain other charges, and the statute under which his bail was revoked as to prior charges was unconstitutional. The court held that the inmate filed a document entitled &quot;Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 5501 and Petition for Review of Bail Pursuant to Me. Crim. P. R. 46(d)&quot; setting forth claims relating to denial of bail on the burglary charge, revocation of bail, and excessive bail. A single justice of the supreme judicial court ruled that the inmate was not entitled to further review of bail. The single justice did not refer to any petition for habeas corpus in his order. Despite the label on the inmate's pleading, a proper petition for a writ of habeas corpus was never filed with the court. Moreover, there was no provision in the Maine Bail Code permitting review by a single justice of the supreme judicial court of a bail determination made initially in the district court. Such bail determinations could only be appealed to the superior court.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 4, &sect; 57 (1989) and Me. R. Civ. P. 76B. The question was, in essence, whether defendant medical center was equitably estopped from pleading the statute of limitations in a medical malpractice action where its asserted negligence caused the mental facilities of plaintiff guardian's ward to be compromised.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to the prepared statement of facts, the center diagnosed the brother with a fatal brain tumor and recommended, after consultation with a neuropathologist at another hospital, that he undergo a series of radiation treatments. While the victim was in control of his faculties during and immediately after the radiation treatments, shortly thereafter his mental abilities declined. The parties agreed he had been mentally incompetent since March 1989, when he executed a power of attorney to his sister. In May 1992, the guardian notified the center of her intent to file a lawsuit for the misdiagnosis. In July 1992, she was appointed legal guardian. The court found that the cause of action accrued, pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 2902 (1990), on the date of the alleged misdiagnosis in June 1988. The victim was competent at this time, so the tolling statute did not pertain. Further, the court found that the center could raise the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense under principles of equitable estoppel because the elements of equitable estoppel were not satisfied in the absence of any action on the center's part to induce delay in instigating suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court certified the question in the negative, finding that equitable principles did not estop the medical center from pleading the statute of limitations under the circumstances presented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to a single life sentence in 1959. The inmate was then convicted of escape and sentenced to serve not less than one nor more than two years consecutive to the life sentence. The inmate succeeded in having his escape sentence increased to persuade the parole board to grant him parole. The parole board discharged his life sentence and he began serving his escape sentence. The inmate was later incarcerated as a parole violator and was informed that his life sentence was reinstated because the earlier discharge was illegal and void. The inmate filed a petition for post-conviction relief, which was denied, and the State was granted summary judgment. The inmate appealed. In vacating the judgment, the court found that the parole board acted beyond its authority in discharging the inmate's life sentence because the reduction was the equivalent of a commutation and intruded on the power reserved to the governor by Me. Const. art. V, pt. 1, &sect; 11. In remanding, the court held that the superior court addressed none of the factors to be considered in determining whether reinstatement of the discharged sentence was violative of due process.</SPAN></P>

For example, some of the services provided to organized municipalities, such as an education subsidy, were not granted to the property owners in the unorganized territory, along with other subsidies or reimbursements. The trial court granted the State agencies summary judgment. The court affirmed, holding that although Me. Const. art.

A legislative scheme for distribution of revenues laid outside scope of Me. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After certain Maine public school teachers received payment from their school districts for up to 30 days of unused sick leave as an incentive to retire, they applied for retirement benefits. Shortly after retirement, they were notified that their benefits had been erroneously calculated and would be reduced. The teachers sought a declaratory judgment that the actions impaired contractual obligations owed to them in violation of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &sect; 17001, and Me. Const. art. II, &sect; 11. The teachers also argued that the board should be estopped. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the board. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of the teachers' contractual claims, concluding that the board's exclusion of payments for unused sick leave from &quot;earnable compensation&quot; because they were made as a &quot;retirement incentive&quot; was in accord with Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &sect; 17001(13)B.

A certificate of sufficiency was issued by the city's deputy clerk. A public hearing was held, at which the city council voted not to place the amendment on the ballot. It advised the citizens to obtain an attorney's letter stating that the amendment did not violate any law or constitutional provision. Without securing that letter, the citizen filed a complaint and a motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking to compel the city to place the amendment on the ballot. The injunction was denied, prompting this appeal. The citizen contended the city could not prohibit the placement of the amendment on the ballot where a valid petition and a certificate of sufficiency existed. She also argued the city needed to get a legal opinion, not the citizens. The court found the city was not obligated to put every citizen-initiated amendment on its ballot. The attorney letter was a requirement of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30-A, &sect; 2104(5)(B) (Pamph. 1994). Since that requirement was not complied with, the motion for a preliminary injunction was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 652(1)(A)(1) (Supp. 1994), violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The taxpayer appealed the trial court's denial of its other constitutional challenges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer operated a summer camp for children of a certain religious faith.

Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 652(1)(A)(1) (Supp. 1994). During the years in question, most of the taxpayer's campers were out-of-state residents, most of whom paid weekly fees in excess of the limit provided by &sect; 652(1)(A)(1) to qualify for the exemption. The assessors refused to grant the exemption. The taxpayer filed a complaint challenging the decision and moved for a summary judgment on its constitutional claims. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 652(1)(A)(1) was constitutional. The exemption statute did not favor in-state camps over out-of-state competitors. Rather, it favored, among in-state camps, those that served a majority of in-state campers. Section 652(1)(A)(1) did not violate the equal protection clause of either the state or federal constitutions or the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution. The campers were not directly subject to state taxation, and &sect; 652(1)(A)(1) did not burden the campers' fundamental rights.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also found that the application of &sect; 6111 did not result in an unconstitutional impairment of the mortgagees' contract rights. The court held that the legislative purpose of &sect; 6111 required affirmance of the trial court's decision and that the legislature intended that &sect; 6111 was to be applied to mortgages executed prior to the effective date of the statute. Neither the 30-day delay nor the procedure required by &sect; 6111 constituted a substantial impairment of the mortgagees' contract rights. The purpose of the statute, which was to prevent unnecessary loss of a mortgagor's home by otherwise unregulated noncommercial lenders, was a significant and legitimate public purpose.

P. 60(b). Since the motion was not brought within one year from the date of judgment, the court acted within its discretion in denying relief. The court rejected the wife's assertion that the pension was awarded to her in the personal property provision. The record was devoid of any evidence that the pension was to be awarded to the wife. The personal property provision only referred to items mentioned in the parties' lists of marital and non-marital property. The court rejected the wife's contention that Me. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Superior Court of Hancock County (Maine), which denied her motion for a new trial. She had been convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 1312-B (Pamph. 1993). She was fined and ordered to pay restitution for court/counsel fees. Pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 4, &sect; 1057 (1989), a 10 percent surcharge was added to her fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was arrested, she asked for a blood test to verify her blood alcohol content. She was taken to a hospital for the test, but then refused to have her blood taken until she was permitted to use the bathroom. The arresting officer found her uncooperative and escorted her to jail. On appeal, the court held that her motion for a new trial was properly denied because she had been given a reasonable opportunity to take a blood test, but had not taken advantage of that opportunity. Therefore, her due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Me. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6-A were not denied. The court held that the order of restitution was improper, even though payment of restitution to the State was permitted by Me. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 1152(2)(A) (Supp. 1993) because restitution was for economic loss caused to the victim. The State's costs of prosecution were not the type of loss envisioned by the statute. The statutory surcharge, which was imposed on every fine, in order to reimburse counties for operational costs of the jail system, was a valid exercise of legislative power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and the fine imposed, but vacated the order of restitution.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 2931, arising from a failed sterilization. The trial court granted summary judgment based on the three-year statute of limitations for professional negligence actions against health care providers in Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 2902.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor performed a tubal ligation on the patient. Nearly three years later, the patient became pregnant. The patient filed her action for damages more than three years after the procedure was performed. On appeal, the patient argued that the statute of limitations for professional negligence did not apply to an action under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 2931, the Wrongful Birth/Life Statute, that the court should apply the discovery rule, and that the statute of limitations violated her constitutional rights. The court affirmed the trial court's decision and found that the Wrongful Birth/Life Statute did not create a cause of action but merely repudiated certain types of actions. If it did create a cause of action it was still an action for professional negligence. The court also found that limiting the use of the discovery rule to the one exception enumerated in the statute of limitations was consistent with the legislative intent of lowering insurance costs. Finally, the court found that the patient's constitutional rights were not violated because there was a rational relationship between limiting use of the discovery rule and reducing insurance premiums.</SPAN></P>

In vacating the trial court's decision, the court held that although the insurance company may have suffered a substantial impairment of its contracts, &sect; 2850(2) had a significant and legitimate public purpose and the adjustment of the parties' rights and responsibilities were reasonable and of a character appropriate to that purpose.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured parties contended that the medical malpractice statute of limitations, Me. Rev. Stat.

XIV. The court found that requiring a medical malpractice victim to discover his injury within three years of the act or omission &quot;giving rise to&quot; the injury, was not so unreasonable as to deny meaningful access to the judicial process. Additionally, the court held that the statute did not violate the equal protection clauses of either U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 by irrationally distinguishing medical misdiagnosis victims from foreign-object victims. The right to pursue a cause of action was not a fundamental right, and medical malpractice tort plaintiffs did not qualify as a suspect class. Therefore the correct standard of review was the rational relationship test. The state's objective -- to control the cost of medical malpractice insurance and of health care in general -- was a legitimate one, and a statute of limitations was a rational way to achieve that objective.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he contended that the material was not &quot;junk&quot; as defined in Me. Rev. Stat.

The court held that the evidence supported the lower courts' conclusions that the landowner was maintaining an unlicensed automobile graveyard and junkyard in violation of the statute. The landowner's subjective intent regarding his use of the materials did not preclude the application of the statute. The court also held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague for failing to define a &quot;serviceable&quot; vehicle in Me. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trade group appealed a grant of summary judgment by the Superior Court, Kennebec County (Maine), in favor of defendant, the State of Maine. The group claimed that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 1868(4), banning the sale of aseptic beverage containers, violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the U.S. and Maine Constitutions, violated the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, and violated 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute banned sales of aseptic containers based on a legislative finding that they were unrecyclable. The group appealed the trial court's rejection of all of its claims but the court affirmed. Finding that the statute involved neither a fundamental right nor a suspect class, the court held that the statute did not violate equal protection. Because there was a rational basis for the State's decision to ban the containers, the group's claim that the legislative &quot;facts&quot; on which the ban was premised were incorrect was irrelevant. That same reasoning underpinned the court's rejection of the group's due process challenge. The court also found no merit to the group's Commerce Clause claim. It approved of the trial court's use of the &quot;flexible approach&quot; to analyze the statute's impact on interstate commerce because the statute had only indirect effect on commerce and regulated all containers, regardless of origin, in an even-handed manner. It agreed with the trial court's analysis, holding that it did not err in finding that the burdens of the statute did not clearly outweigh the benefits thereof, and also agreed with the group waived its &sect; 1983 claim by not arguing it on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the entry of summary judgment in favor of the State on the group's claims that certain legislation regulating packaging was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court (Maine), which found him guilty under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 1092 (Supp. 1993) of violating a condition of his preconviction release on bail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a condition of his release on bail on charges of gross sexual assault and kidnapping, defendant agreed that he would have no contact, direct or indirect, with the victim or her family members. About two weeks after his release, defendant slowed down his car as he passed the victim's car, turned around, and followed her. Defendant then made an obscene gesture as he passed the victim's car, swerved in front of her, and gestured for her to turn right at a stop sign. The court held that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 1026(3)(A)(5), which authorized the condition, was not unconstitutionally vague because the word &quot;contact&quot; was commonly understood and the language of the statute provided sufficient notice to defendant that his conduct could result in criminal prosecution. Defendant was protected from an overly broad application of the statute by the jury instruction that the State was required to prove a knowing violation of the condition. Finally, the court found that the jury could rationally have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knowingly had contact with the victim in violation of the condition of his preconviction release on bail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town's recycling ordinance required recycling material to be separated from non-recyclable waste. The ordinance directed that all recyclable materials be delivered to the town's transfer station. The hauler did not comply with the ordinance's separation requirement and disposed of the waste it collected to a cheaper destination. The hauler filed a complaint against the town, requesting a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was invalid and an injunction preventing the town from enforcing it. The town then filed its own complaint against the hauler, requesting that the hauler be enjoined from collecting waste and ordered to pay fines for violating the ordinance. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The superior court granted summary judgment in favor of the town. The hauler appealed. The court affirmed, holding that there was a rational relationship between the separation of recyclable materials from non-recyclable waste and the ordinance's stated goal to encourage recycling. Thus, the ordinance was a proper exercise of the town's police power. The court also concluded that the hauler's equal protection and selective prosecution contentions were without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a garbage company and a recycling company, challenged a grant of the Superior Court (Cumberland County) (Maine) of the summary judgment motion by defendant Town of Gray (Maine) in the action for declaratory and injunctive relief regarding the contentions that the Solid Waste, Flow Control and Recycling Ordinance violated the Commerce Clause, plaintiffs' equal protection rights, and state and federal antitrust laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance required disposing all solid waste that was generated in the town at a specified facility in order to regulate sold waste collection and disposal, to encourage recycling, and to provide disposal facilities at a reasonable cost. The court vacated the judgment and remanded, concluding that genuine issues of material fact existed regarding if the Commerce Clause was violated. The equal protection and antitrust claims as to distinguishing between commercial enterprise and private waste generators, which could deposit trash at the town's transfer station without paying a tipping fee, lacked merit because the ordinance met a valid state interest, precedent established that the town was immune from federal antitrust laws as to the ordinance, and the state authority for the ordinance precluded holding that state antitrust laws were violated. The Commerce Clause protected solid waste haulers, the ordinance effected interstate commerce by prohibiting waste that would otherwise be available for interstate trade from crossing the state line, and the Town had to show a reason other than economic protectionism for the ordinance and that no reasonable options to it existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After several customers requested an investigation of the telephone company, the Commission found that it was earning more than a reasonable rate of return and overcompensating its executives. The court affirmed the Commission's order, and rejected the company's assertion that the Commission's use of a residual ratemaking methodology to determine appropriate rates violated the Supremacy Clause. The field of rate regulation had not been preempted by the Federal Communications Commission. Because the company's revenues from interstate billing and collection services were not separated from its regulated activities prior to jurisdictional separations and because it chose to use average schedules rather than a cost-based jurisdictional separation, the Commission did not err by including the company's interstate billing and collection revenues in its total revenues for residual ratemaking purposes. It was not an abuse of discretion for the Commission to find that, although the base salary and bonus plan were both reasonable when standing alone, they were unreasonable when combined.</SPAN></P>

The city adopted a flow control ordinance which prohibited the solid waste disposal at any site other than the waste corporation's site. The trial court granted the injunction. On appeal, the court vacated the injunction and remanded with instructions. The court held: (1) that it was error to grant summary judgment because there were factual questions; (2) that the ordinance discriminated against interstate commerce because it required the refuse hauler to take recyclable materials to a certain site and prohibited it from marketing them in interstate commerce; and (3) that, since the ordinance was discriminatory, the burden shifted to the city to show valid reasons for the ordinance other than economic protectionism and to demonstrate the unavailability of reasonable alternatives.

Defendant, along with a friend, also performed oral sex on her niece and touched the niece's vagina with their hands. Defendant also encouraged her niece to have sex with defendant's former boyfriend, which the niece did. The court affirmed the numerous convictions entered against defendant.

Furthermore, where the niece was living with defendant, defendant owed her a duty of care and protection. Defendant's conduct in actively fostering, condoning, and encouraging the niece to have sex was clearly conduct prohibited by the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a budgetary shortfall, the state legislature adopted statutory modifications to the pension benefits that it provided state employees. Plaintiffs filed an action against defendant's which sought a declaration that the modifications were unconstitutional and an injunction that enjoined the enforcement of the modifications. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, holding that the modifications violated the Contract Clauses of Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. On appeal, the court vacated the trial court's judgment and remanded to the trial court with instructions to enter judgment in favor of defendants. The court held that absent a clear indication that the legislature intended to bind itself contractually, there was a presumption that the law did not create a private contract or right. The court found that the retirement statutes were general policy principles and did not contain a clear indication of an intent to create immutable contracts for all state employees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant town sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court, York County (Maine), which found in favor of defendant charter commission and declared virtually all of the provisions of the Town of York Home Rule Charter valid. The commission cross-appealed from a separate judgment that found in favor of plaintiff school committee and declared the Charter provisions invalid that related to school budget matters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The committee filed a declaratory judgment action that challenged the validity of the Charter's school budget provisions and the town counter-claimed seeking a judgment that declared the extent to which the Charter provisions were enforceable if the school provisions were invalid. The court vacated the superior court's judgment which determined that the Charter's school budget provisions were invalid. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30-A, &sect; 3001, the home rule statute, was not violated by the school-budget charter provisions because Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A was not an exclusive legislative scheme that implicitly preempted municipal legislation on education in the absence of an express grant of authority. The court affirmed the superior court's judgment which found that the non-school provisions of the Charter did not violate the town's home rule charter authority because Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30-A, &sect; 3001 constituted an independent and plenary grant of power to municipalities to legislate on matters that were beyond those exclusively &quot;local and municipal&quot; and was not limited by the Maine Constitution's narrower home rule provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Secretary of State appealed a judgment from the Superior Court, Kennebec County (Maine), which determined that he violated the first amendment of the federal constitution and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 (1981) by refusing to furnish plaintiff voter with petition forms to invoke the voter initiative process authorized by Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, &sect;&sect; 901-906 (1993), and awarded attorney fees to him pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 (1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Secretary contended that by denying the voter's petition prior to its circulation for signature he was merely advancing the substantive review that he believed was authorized after the signed petitions were submitted, and accordingly, he had not interfered with the voter's constitutional rights. The court disagreed. Because the petition process was protected by the First Amendment and the Secretary had advanced no compelling interest in executive oversight of the content of the petition prior to its circulation for signature, his refusal to furnish the petition form based on the content of the proposed legislation impermissibly violated the voter's rights protected by the first amendment. Because the voter prevailed on his claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, he was entitled to recover his attorney fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The court concluded that the attorney fee award properly reflected the Secretary's responsibility for the deprivation of the voter's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

Appellee sought a divorce on the ground of abusive treatment, but the parties agreed to modify the ground to irreconcilable differences and were awarded a divorce. Appellee then sued appellant for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. A directed verdict was entered for appellant on the negligent infliction claim and a judgment was rendered for appellee on the intentional infliction claim. The court affirmed the judgment. It found that intentional infliction of emotional distress through physical violence and accompanying verbal abuse during the marriage was not privileged conduct, and therefore an action between spouses was not barred by interspousal immunity. Further, res judicata did not bar the tort action subsequent to the divorce judgment because the issues involved were entirely distinct. Finally, the action was not time barred because the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim was independent of an underlying assault and battery claim and the limitations period was six years, not the two year period for an assault and battery claim.</SPAN></P>

The intentional infliction of emotional distress action was not time barred, although appellee was time barred from obtaining damages for an underlying assault and battery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A district attorney and civil liberties organization, acting on behalf of defendant superior court, challenged a determination by the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine that the superior court exceeded its authority when it issued an order imposing certain conditions on plaintiff Department of Corrections (DOC) relating to the conditions under which two borderline mentally retarded, child sexual offenders would be incarcerated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court imposed five conditions on the offenders commitments that it concluded were necessary to protect them from abuse in light of their mental status and vulnerability. The superior court reasoned that it had the inherent authority to impose such conditions in light of its constitutional obligation to ensure that sentences did not violate the prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment in Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as under the implicit authority flowing from Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 1151 (1983 &amp; Supp. 1992). On appeal, the court held that the complaint for mandamus or prohibition was properly before it under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 5301 (1980) and tit. 4, &sect; 7 (1989). The court agreed with the DOC that the superior court had exceeded its authority in that it had before it no vehicle that invoked a supervisory power over the DOC. The court concluded that the duty of the court to uphold the federal and state constitutions had not been invoked by appropriate process and the court's constitutional oath did not confer a roving commission to seek out and correct violations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 657(b)(1), a certain portion of each monthly child support payment received by the state from absent parents was to be &quot;passed through&quot; to the respective AFDC welfare recipients without affecting the recipients' eligibility for assistance. A regulation promulgated by the United States Department of Health and Human Services provided that only one pass-through was required to be made to a recipient even if more than one month of child support arrearages were collected in a given month. Federal courts struck down the regulation and required pass-through payments with respect to each month for which child support was collected, even when received in arrears. However, the federal courts refused to order retroactive pass-through payments for child support and let the state make its own determination regarding eligibility for past benefits. The trial court rejected the recipients' argument that the denial of the retroactive pass-through benefits was an unconstitutional taking, and the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the recipients had no property rights in the pass-through payments and that they were merely additional welfare benefits.</SPAN></P>

The industry sought a finding that the amended beverage container deposit statute,&nbsp;Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 32 &sect; 1866-A, effected a taking of property without just compensation in violation of Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 and the U.S. Const. amend. V.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged amendment provided that the industry had to maintain a deposit transaction account, defined the minimum deposit as the property of the consumer, declared that such deposit value was held by the industry in trust for the consumer or for the state if the deposit was abandoned by the consumer. On a quarterly basis, 50 percent of the unclaimed minimum deposits were to be remitted to the state. The court affirmed the judgment. The amendment did not authorize a physical invasion or confiscation of the beverage industry's property but merely regulated its sale of beverage containers by making it financially accountable for those containers not returned. The existence of a wealth transfer did not convert a regulation into physical invasion. The amendment was part of an environmental regulation that fell squarely within the state's police power to regulate for the public health and safety.</SPAN></P>

The superior court also denied the survivors' motion for compulsory joinder. The court affirmed those grants and that denial on appeal, reasoning that the intoxicated person was not &quot;retained in the action&quot; as the judgment and the plain language of Me. Rev. Stat.

The court concluded that the intoxicated person was not a real party in interest with a financial stake in the action's conclusion and that allowing the action to proceed against the server of alcohol while the intoxicated person was a nominal party would have undercut the Act's legislative purpose of a fair allocation of the survivors' damages. The court further found that Me. Rev. Stat.

Holding that the landowner was indisputably required to obtain a permit, the court held that the board was nevertheless entitled to deference in its decision that the landowner's project failed to comply with erosion and sedimentation standards in order to qualify for a permit. Further, the court found that there was adequate evidence in the record to support the finding that the rebuilding might cause an unreasonable amount of soil erosion under 38 Me. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Penobscot County (Maine) affirming the judgment of the district court finding him guilty of criminal threatening contrary to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 209 (1983). Defendant contended that he was entitled to use deadly force in the defense of his home under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 104(3)(B)(2) (1983).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Acting on a phone call, police went to defendant's house without a warrant believing that he had murdered his wife. Defendant refused to let police enter his home after several requests, and threatened to use knives if they attempted to enter his home with guns. Eventually defendant relented and was arrested for criminal threatening. The district court found that deadly force had not been used, and that defendant did not reasonably believe that the police would commit further crimes once they entered his home. Therefore, defendant was not entitled to threaten deadly force in defense of his home. The superior court affirmed. On review, the court reversed, holding that the threat of deadly force was not tantamount to the use of deadly force and that the district court had applied the wrong legal standard to an assertion of self-defense. The court ruled that under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 104(1) (1983), the threat of deadly force was nondeadly and could be used by defendant if he reasonably believed it was necessary to prevent a further trespass in his home. Without a warrant and probable cause, the police were trespassing in defendant's home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee injured his left knee one year and his right knee two years later. He received compensation benefits based on his average wages, earnings or salary pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 39, &sect; 2(2)(A) (1989). The employee's first injury was covered by the employer's original insurance company but his subsequent injury was covered by a subsequent insurer. The subsequent insurer made the total payments directly to the employee and included union payments in the employee's benefits, but the original insurance company refused to include the union payments in its reimbursement payments to the original insurance company. The commission submitted questions of law seeking a declaration regarding whether the union payments were to be included in the employee's benefits. The court determined that the employee's claim was not subject to the new legislation because it was pending on the effective date of the legislation overturning the court's decision allowing for the inclusion of union payments. The court therefore held that prior case law could be applied to allow union payments to be included in the employee's benefit determination.</SPAN></P>

Admin. Ct. R. 321, which imposed a fee in any civil case in which trial by jury was demanded. The litigants alleged that the jury fee violated the principle of separation of powers and violated their constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The litigants alleged that they wanted their pending cases presented to a jury, but the jury fee created a financial hardship for them. The litigants requested a declaration that the fee was unconstitutional and sought and injunction against its enforcement. The lower court granted summary judgment to defendants. The court affirmed. Each litigant voluntarily decided whether to demand a jury trial and thus incur the fee. The figures supported defendants' contention that revenues anticipated from the fee were proportionate to the expense of operating the civil jury trial system. Civil litigation obligated defendants to provide jurors. The court concluded that the non-refundable jury fee did not constitute an unreasonable restriction on the assertion of the right to a jury trial in a civil case. Since the litigants made no challenge to the process used to enforce the order, the fee did not violate their constitutional right to due process. Under the rational basis standard of review, it was clear that requiring those who request jury trials to pay a reasonable fee toward its provision was a rational method of maintaining a civil jury trial system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff realty brokers appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Kennebec County (Maine), which dismissed the brokers' complaint seeking a review of an advisory ruling issued by defendant Real Estate Commission. The ruling held that the term &quot;for sale by owner&quot; by an agency to promote or market the sale of property on behalf of others for compensation would deceive the public and violate Me. Real Estate Comm'n R. ch. 330, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The brokers contended that the Commission acted in excess of its statutory authority and its own rules by issuing the advisory ruling and that the ruling was arbitrary and capricious and an unconstitutional restraint on their freedom of commercial expression. The court disagreed. The court was satisfied that the controversy was sufficiently &quot;real&quot; that adjudication did not contravene the constitutional prohibition against issuing unauthorized advisory opinions. The ruling was not an unauthorized act because Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5 &sect; 9001(1) authorized the issuing of advisory rulings concerning the applicability to an existing factual situation of any statutes or rules the Commission administered. There was no requirement of concrete evidence of consumer deception before the Commission issued such an advisory ruling. Given the potential to mislead the public when a real estate broker used the phrase &quot;for sale by owner,&quot; the brokers failed to meet their burden of proving that the advisory ruling was arbitrary or capricious or characterized by an abuse of discretion. Finally, the First Amendment did not protect misleading commercial speech.</SPAN></P>

A blood test revealed defendant's blood alcohol content was 0.22 percent by weight, as certified to by the chemist who analyzed the blood sample. Defendant asserted that the officer did not have a reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop his vehicle and that the chemist's certificate was inadmissible because the phlebotomist who drew the sample did not certify pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 1312(6) (1991) that he had followed the proper procedure in drawing defendant's blood. On appeal, the court held that the officer made a valid investigatory stop under Me. Const. art.

The court also held that the admission of the chemist's certificate under Me. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Superior Court (Maine), which convicted him of operating a motor vehicle after his license had been revoked for being a habitual offender in violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 2298 (Pamph. 1991). Defendant contended that the stop of his vehicle leading to his arrest was not based on a reasonable and articulable suspicion and that a mandatory minimum jail sentence was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer who made an investigatory stop of defendant's vehicle had information that defendant's license had been revoked under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 2293 for being an habitual offender and that he had recently operated the vehicle. For an officer to make a valid investigatory stop, the officer had to act on the basis of specific and articulable facts which, taken with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warranted the intrusion. The court found that the trial court's finding of sufficient evidence to support a reasonable, articulable suspicion that defendant was driving without a license was not clearly erroneous. The court also determined that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 2298(2) under which defendant was sentenced to a mandatory minimum of 60 days in jail because he had a previous operating under the influence conviction did not violate defendant's constitutional rights to equal protection and due process. There was a rational basis for treating a habitual offender differently because of a prior operating under the influence conviction because drunk drivers posed a severe highway hazard, and the statute was a valid exercise of the State's police power.</SPAN></P>

At an earlier hearing, the trial court had held that the road, which traversed the landowner's property, had been abandoned under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 3028 (Supp. 1990).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The County had heard the landowner's petition seeking to have the Town repair the road under Me. Rev. Stat.

The court held that the Town was not precluded from filing its counterclaim for a declaratory judgment to litigate the issue of the road's abandonment because the County did not litigate that issue. In the court's view, there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's determination of abandonment. The Town showed that the townspeople voted in 1932 to discontinue the road. Further, two selectmen of the Town, who had to approve the road maintenance schedule and road repairs, testified that the road had never been repaired at the Town's expense from 1960 to 1990. Finally, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 3028 (Supp. 1990) did not effect a &quot;taking&quot; within the meaning of the Maine or the federal constitutions and did not deny the landowner due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was on death role in Nebraska, was found guilty of murdering an 11-year-old boy. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that defendant's right to a speedy trial under the U.S. Const. amends. VI, and XIV, and Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, was not violated. After defendant had been indicted in Maine the state of Nebraska was reluctant to release him from their custody for fear he may not be returned to the state. An agreement was eventually worked out between the two states. Thus, the reasons for the delay provided no basis for a speedy trial violation. The court found that defendant's interview to a writer of a book was properly admitted into evidence because the U.S. Const. amends. V and VI protections did not apply to the statements made to the writer. The court held that evidence of a bite wound in another case involving defendant was properly admitted as a prior bad act under Me. R. Evid. 404(b) because it was used to prove identity of the perpetrator. There was no error in allowing into evidence a hypnotically refreshed sketch because there could have been no suggestion as to defendant since he was not considered a suspect until after the hypnosis procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lender appealed an order of the Superior Court, Cumberland County (Maine) granting summary judgment to defendants, a borrower, who was a hospital district, the district's board of trustees, and a town, on the lender's request for an injunction in the nature of a mandamus ordering the board to issue a warrant to the town assessor in an amount sufficient to cover the principal and interest payments on the district's note.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under P. &amp; S.L. 1955, ch. 54 &sect; 4, the hospital district was given the power to issue bonds and notes that were legal obligations of the district and the board was given the authority to issue a warrant to the town assessors each year in an amount necessary to meet the district's expenses, including payments on notes and bonds. The district issued a note to the lender but the hospital closed and the district defaulted on the note. The lender filed suit asking the court, inter alia, to order the board to issue a warrant to the town assessors in an amount sufficient to provide for payment of the note. On the lender's appeal, the court noted that, although the extraordinary writs, including mandamus, had been abolished in Maine, Me. R. Civ. P. 81(c), it was possible to obtain an injunction in the nature of mandamus using the procedure set out in Me. R. Civ. P. 80B. Looking to the traditional common law of mandamus, the court determined that the governmental action the lender sought to compel was strictly ministerial, that the lender was entitled to an order mandating the issuance of the warrant, and that the lender was otherwise without an adequate remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the summary judgment entered against the lender was error, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to superior court for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed from a summary judgment entered in the Superior Court, Knox County (Maine), which ruled in favor of defendants, a town and the town manager, in the employee's action for an alleged breach of contract, defamation, invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, wrongful discharge, and a violation of her civil rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties reached a settlement that resulted in a payment to the employee by the town in exchange for her resignation from her job as the town secretary and bookkeeper and a signed release of all claims against the town. Soon after execution of the settlement agreement, a series of newspaper articles revealed that the employee had resigned for personal reasons, she had received a monetary settlement from the town, and the town's books were in disarray. The court ruled that the signed release recited the consideration given by the town, but was silent with respect to the employee's resignation. The court held that it was a binding partially integrated agreement which discharged the town from all promises. The town's alleged oral promise to keep the terms of the settlement confidential was inconsistent with the terms of the release and was therefore discharged. The court also held that the employee was not defamed, nor was her privacy invaded, by the newspaper reports that revealed her resignation and the terms of the settlement agreement. The court ruled that the trial court had properly granted defendants' motion for a summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 28-A, &sect;&sect; 2501-2519, by serving alcohol to the visibly intoxicated guest at a party held at the owner's house, plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that the Act's punitive damages cap contained at Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 28-A, &sect; 2509, its exclusivity provision contained at Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 28-A, &sect; 2511, and its abolition of joint liability set out at Me. Rev. Stat.

Defendants and the State appealed the invalidation of the cap, and plaintiff cross-appealed the validation of the rest of the Act. The court upheld the entire Act. Noting that it had never ruled on the common law liability of an alcohol server to third parties, the court held that the Act's establishment of an unquestioned basis for legal liability, even with limited recovery, was rationally related to its stated goal of providing a more effective incentive for the responsible service of liquor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a multinational nonresident corporation. The State Tax Assessor employed a unitary business formula apportionment method to tax the income of the taxpayer. The taxpayer challenged the assessment. The State Tax Assessor filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. The taxpayer sought review and claimed that the State Tax Assessor failed to exclude certain factors relating to its foreign affiliates and, thus, the formula was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found the formula unconstitutional and vacated the order of the trial court. The court held: (1) in taxing the nonresident corporation, Maine was limited to taxing the portion of the corporation's income attributable to business activity within the state; (2) by taxing income not attributable to Maine, the formula violated the due process and commerce clause of the United States Constitution; and (3) Maine was not permitted to include dividends received from the taxpayer's foreign affiliates in its business income apportioned to Maine, therefore, the taxpayer met its burden of showing by clear and cogent evidence that the formula resulted in extra-territorial values being taxed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, employers and an insurer, and plaintiff claimant challenged an order of the Workers' Compensation Commission Appellate Division (Maine), which held that plaintiff employee's benefits for his compensable injury should have included the amount that his employer paid for the various union-established funds and that the mandatory social security contributions that her employer made were excluded from the claimant's benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate division held that the contributions to the union-established funds was includable in the employee's benefits and that the mandatory social security benefits that the claimant's employer paid should have been excluded from her benefits. The court affirmed the judgment in the employee's action, vacated the judgment in the claimant's action, and remanded that action with an instruction to affirm the decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission. The court reasoned that retroactively applying a precedent did not affect the employee's employer insurance contract, noting that the precedent did not change the employee's average weekly wages under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 2(2) or any duty to compensate him based on his average weekly wages. The court also held that, as to the claimant, the definition of &quot;average weekly wages, earnings, and salary&quot; was wrongfully expanded to include benefits that did not meet the requirements in the precedent on which both decisions in this action was based, noting that the precedent distinguished the benefits within the employment agreement in that case from those for which other employment agreements traditionally provided.</SPAN></P>

The court held the trial court erred in reversing the board's decision to deny the application for a variance because the landowners failed to satisfy their burden of proof of undue hardship, and affirmed the judgment in all other respects.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the trial court did not violate Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. 15, &sect; 1258-A because although the trial court conducted the initial voir dire, it also permitted defendant's counsel to submit questions and to conduct additional voir dire under its direction. Further, the court ruled that the trial court did not violate the Maine Constitution in transferring the trial to Penobscot County because defendant had no objection to a change and Penobscot County could more easily have accommodated the joint trial. However, the court found that the trial court erred in its instruction on accomplice liability by not specifying a primary crime or its elements. The court ruled that without such instruction, the jury would have been unable to determine whether defendant intended to promote or facilitate such a crime of which manslaughter was a reasonably foreseeable consequence. The error was not prejudicial, however, because the jury's verdict of guilty of murder rendered any error in the instructions on manslaughter harmless.</SPAN></P>

Defendant police chief denied the application because of the resident's failure to have completed the form. The court held that requiring citizens to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons constituted reasonable regulation. The concealed weapons statute was a reasonable response to the justifiable public safety concern engendered by the carrying of concealed weapons. The permit requirements for those weapons passed constitutional muster as an acceptable regulation of the individual's right to keep and bear arms. In reviewing the resident's application for a permit, the police chief did not reach the merits of the application but acted well within his discretion in denying the application on the basis of the resident's refusal to comply with the explicit procedural directives of the statute. The statute authorized the requirement of both a release and the agreement to give one as needed, and the resident had no justification for refusing to sign those parts of the application.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment in favor of the department. The court held that not all travel was protected under the United States Constitution as fundamental. Rather, that protection was accorded migration undertaken &quot;with intent to settle and abide.&quot; The court further held that the rafter's intrastate recreational use of the rivers did not fall within the perimeters of the constitutionally protected fundamental right to travel so as to trigger strict scrutiny of the registration requirement and that in applying the proper test, the registration requirement for the noncommercial users of the regulated rivers bears a rational relationship to the state's legitimate purposes of preventing evasion of the law by commercial outfitters and of monitoring the use of its limited whitewater resources.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 2902 (1990).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Seven years after the alleged malpractice acts occurred, the Maine legislature passed &sect; 2902, which did away with the tolling provision applicable to minors. However, the legislature delayed the effective date for two years. Defendants claimed that &sect; 2902, was unconstitutional because it effectively foreclosed a child under the age of 12 years at the time of the accrual of an action for the alleged professional negligence of a health care provider from ever bringing an action in the child's own name. The court held that the time limits provided in &sect; 2902 did not deny meaningful access to the judicial process by a child under the age of 12 years at the time of the accrual of an action for alleged negligent medical care. The state in its fullest exercise of sovereignty had the inherent power to pass regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and welfare. Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 was not construed as prohibiting reasonable limits on the time within which a claimant could seek redress in the courts. The absence of a tolling provision for a legal disability, thus making a claimant dependent on another to assert his rights, did not per se offend art. I, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers observed defendant on three separate occasions dragging for scallops or operating a drag in a prohibited area. Defendant argued that the statute was invalid emergency legislation, was vague, violated equal protection, and was an invalid exercise of police power. The court held that the preamble to the legislation implied that the reason for the emergency statute was to prevent the loss of electricity by illegal dragging, and was sufficient. Although the statute did not specify whether the boundaries of the prohibited area were made in reference to the high or low water marks, the omission did not render the statute unconstitutionally vague. Although the prohibited area exceeded the length and width of the cable, it did not render the statute arbitrary or capricious. The officers' observations established an articulable suspicion to stop defendant and examine his boat. Because defendant invited an officer into his home, his statements regarding the alleged offenses were not the result of an improper confession and were admissible.

The court held that the statute provided sufficient notice to defendant that his conduct could result in criminal prosecution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father contended that requiring him to reimburse the state for the AFDC payments, which were used in part to support the child's mother, exceeded statutory authority and violated his constitutional right to equal protection of the laws. The court found, however, that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect;&sect; 495, 498 provided authority for the Department of Human Services to recover from unwed fathers the full amount of AFDC payments made to eligible mothers.Because an unwed mother had an identical support obligation with respect to a child in a father's care, the court found no denial of equal protection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer's workers notified the employer that they were going to strike. The employer wanted to hire replacement workers by telephone. On advice of counsel, the employer concluded that Me. Rev. Stat.

It contacted law enforcement authorities but, before the 10 days elapsed, the strikers returned to work. The employer filed a declaratory judgment action after the work stoppage had ended and claimed the Maine statute was preempted by federal labor law and was unconstitutional. On the employer's motion for summary judgment, the trial court ruled that the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 151-68 (1973), preempted Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 595 (1988). The State appealed and the court dismissed and concluded that the case did not present a justiciable issue because the application and effect of the statute were so uncertain in the instant factual context as to both the employer and future disputes. The court held that the telephonic hiring activity did not fall under the language of &sect; 595.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from an order of the Superior Court, Cumberland County (Maine), dismissing the count of an indictment that charged defendant with possession of a firearm by a felon, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 393(1). Defendant had pleaded not guilty and sought its dismissal, claiming that &sect; 393(1) was unconstitutional as applied to him because his right to keep and bear arms was absolute, and the superior court had dismissed on that basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that his prior felony conviction was for the &quot;nonviolent&quot; crime of operating a motor vehicle while under revocation, so that &sect; 393(1) was unconstitutional as applied because his right to keep and bear arms was rendered absolute by reason of Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 as amended. The court disagreed, vacated the order, and remanded. It held that a citizen's right to keep and bear arms under amended &sect; 16 was not absolute and that the statute under which he was charged represented a reasonable exercise of the State's constitutional police power. Defendant had shown himself to be an individual unable to obey highway safety laws to such an egregious extent that he was imprisoned for 60 days due to his continued flagrant lawlessness. It found that labeling his preexisting felony status as being the product of a &quot;nonviolent&quot; crime obscured its seriousness and that defendant had demonstrated such a disregard for the law that, as applied to him, a legislative finding that he was an undesirable person to possess a firearm was entirely reasonable and consonant with the legitimate exercise of police power. Thus, the statute was not unconstitutional as applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The power company had brought a declaratory judgment action against the town seeking a declaration that the town ordinance prohibiting non-agricultural use of pesticides without prior town approval was invalid as an improper delegation of power and preempted by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act of 1975 (FIFRA) and by both the Maine Pesticides Control Act (Pesticide Control Act) and the Maine Board of Pesticides Control Act (Pesticide Board Act). The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the town. The court held that FIFRA expressly delegated regulatory power to the states and the congressional intent was not to preclude a state's political subdivision from enacting its own more stringent regulations. The court found that neither the Pesticide Control Act nor the Pesticide Board Act contained any provisions explicitly preempting local regulation of the use of pesticides. The court noted that through the ordinance, the town legislative body reserved to itself authority to decide exceptions to its prohibition on non-agricultural commercial spraying.</SPAN></P>

Appellant had challenged the limitations on its fee award on the grounds that the fact that its clients had settled their claims meant that they were not &quot;prevailing parties&quot; under the Workers' Compensation Act (a matter of importance since the administrative authority to regulate attorney fees was predicated on their being a prevailing party). The court found the argument devoid of merit. It also rejected appellant's contention that its fees were unduly limited, particularly in the case in which the fees sought exceeded the amount recovered.

The two jury trials ended quickly but the court continued defendant's case as scheduled due to the absence of the witnesses. Defendant's motion to dismiss because of the delay was denied. In affirming defendant's conviction the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in case management. The court noted that defendant was not prejudiced by the delay. Nor was it an abuse of discretion under Me. R. Crim. P. 16(d) to refuse to sanction an alleged discovery violation by the State. The court held that defense counsel had been on notice for an ample time of the type of blood alcohol test that was used. Proof of the chain of custody of the breath sample was adequate under Me. R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of York County (Maine), which convicted her of six counts of endangering the welfare of a child, a violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 554 (1983). Defendant was convicted of one count for each of her six children. The charges involved defendant's failure to provide adequate supervision, food, clothing, and shelter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allowed her children to wander the streets and allowed her residence to become unfit for habitation. Defendant also failed to provide any meals for the children, failed to provide adequate clothing, and failed to bathe or clean the children or their clothing. Defendant contended that &sect; 554 was unconstitutionally vague because it did not define the duty of care or protection and did not specify which persons had the duty. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 554 was constitutional. Section 554 directly prohibited the endangering of a child's health, safety, or mental welfare. Because a reasonable person of ordinary intelligence could understand what conduct was prohibited, &sect; 554 provided a sufficient standard to withstand constitutional attack. Therefore, it was clear that defendant, the children's natural mother, with whom they lived, had a duty of care, and that her duty extended to caring for their health, safety, and mental welfare.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance, which affected the dispensing of alcoholic beverages, limitation of business hours, and equipment to be used. The court held that the purposes of the ordinances were reasonably related to the public health, and were a valid exercise of the police power under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 2151. Exemptions for businesses that were already regulated or licensed did not create an irrational and illegal classification. The ordinance sufficiently described the conduct proscribed and was not void for vagueness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an attorney, was charged by a client with stealing an amount of money that had been entrusted to him for investment purposes.

In the subsequent criminal trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress those statements as involuntary. The trial court granted his motion, causing the prosecution to appeal. On review, the court disagreed that the mandatory nature of Me. Bar. R. 2(c) rendered the statements involuntary. In fact, the court found that an appropriate answer to the questions posed by the bar could have been an invocation of defendant's Fifth Amendment rights. Of course, the bar would then be free to draw its own conclusions regarding his silence, but defendant nevertheless remained free to refuse to answer on the grounds that his answers could prove incriminating.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a special condition of his probation, defendant was required to undergo treatment to the satisfaction of the probation officer, for sex offenders, including group and family therapy. Defendant's convictions were affirmed on appeal. In defendant's current motion, he sought a court order explaining or removing the probation condition. On appeal, the court held defendant's failure to challenge his sentence in his first appeal precluded him from raising that issue in a second appeal to the law court. A challenge to the &quot;legality&quot; of a sentence could be brought to the law court on direct appeal when the alleged illegality appeared affirmatively on the face of the record. Principles of res judicata, however, precluded defendant from taking a second appeal to the law court from his conviction and sentence based on an issue that was or could have been raised in the prior appeal. Except for direct appeals to the law court from a criminal conviction and sentence, post-conviction review provided the exclusive method of review of those criminal judgments and of post-sentencing proceedings occurring during the course of sentences, in accordance with Me.

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 3106, if enacted. The questions were: (1) whether the bill, which allowed the use of municipal tax revenues to maintain a privately owned road, violated the &quot;public purpose&quot; limitation in Me. Const. art. IV, pt. 3, &sect; 1; (2) whether the bill, which allowed a municipality to assess the users of a right-of-way for the maintenance of that way, violated the federal or state constitutions; and (3) whether the restrictions in the definition of a &quot;privately owned road&quot; violated the federal or state constitutions. The justices answered the first question in the affirmative, holding that the state legislature had the power to tax only to the extent that the tax revenues were spent for public purposes, and that the maintenance of privately owned roads would be an unconstitutional appropriation of public funds. The second question was answered in the affirmative for the same reasons. As to the third question, it was held that if the bill were otherwise constitutional, it would not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The attorney challenged the constitutionality of the requirement of the Maine Bar Rules for submitting to binding arbitration of a dispute with his client over the lawyer's fee. The representative filed a motion in the superior court for entry of judgment confirming the arbitration award pursuant to Me. B. R. 9(i), Code Prof. Resp. and Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 5937 (1980), while the attorney sought to vacate the award on the basis that compulsory arbitration was unconstitutional. The court upheld confirmation of the arbitration award, noting that the attorney's objection was untimely, while also concluding that the Supreme Judicial Court had authority to regulate the legal profession, Me. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1, and that oversight of fees was within that authority.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the jury was misled because the trial court had instructed it on a matter that had not been argued. The court held: (1) &sect; 2508 was violated if a vehicle was operated without brakes that were in good working order, mechanically safe, and did not pose a hazard as required by Me. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of York County (Maine) revoking his confinement under intensive supervision pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 1261(1) (Supp. 1987-1988), on the grounds that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to dismiss for failure to hold a hearing within seven days as required by Me. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally sentenced to three years' imprisonment with all but 13 months suspended. The final year of the unsuspended term was to be served with intensive supervision, combined with counseling, followed by probation. When defendant's counselor reported that defendant had refused to participate and had threatened other members of the counseling group, the trial court scheduled a revocation hearing. The hearing was continued three times. As a result, the trial court imprisoned defendant for the remainder of his prison term. Defendant appealed, alleging a violation of tit. 17-A, &sect; 1265(2), and attacking the constitutionality of the supervision conditions. By the time oral argument was scheduled, defendant had been released from prison. The court granted the State's motion to dismiss the appeal as moot. Although a case of first impression, the court reasoned that an appeal would be a waste of valuable judicial resources. The court noted that defendant would still be on three years' probation under conditions different than intensive supervision. Therefore, no justiciable issue was presented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with manslaughter after running a stop sign, colliding with another vehicle, and causing the death of a three-year-old child. While at the hospital, defendant made several incriminating statements. The prosecutor agreed to allow defendant to plead guilty to a lesser charge and dismissed the indictment. After the superior court rejected the agreement, defendant was re-indicted for manslaughter and convicted. Defendant appealed, arguing that the manslaughter statute was unconstitutionally, vague, that her confession was involuntary and that she was denied a speedy trial. The court affirmed. The manslaughter statute required proof of one of two culpable mental states, &quot;recklessness&quot; or &quot;criminal negligence,&quot; both requiring that the conduct of the actor be a &quot;gross deviation from the standard a reasonable and prudent person would observe in the same situation. The words &quot;gross deviation&quot; gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair warning of the prohibited conduct. Defendant's statements were voluntary, although made after the hospital gave her a mild sedative. A 16-month delay between indictment and trial was not caused by prosecutorial bad faith.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the parents' constitutional challenges. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, which had denied the parent's request to be free from the prior approval requirement. The court held that, after the parents had shown that the State imposed a significant restraint on their exercise of a sincerely held religious belief, the State met its burden of proof by showing that the prior approval requirement for home schooling programs was motivated by the State's compelling public interest in education and that there was no less restrictive means available for achieving that interest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a planning board granted the company preliminary subdivision approval, the town amended its land use ordinance to strengthen the standards to be applied by the board of appeals on conditional use applications. The board of appeals determined that the grandfathering provisions of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, &sect; 302 protected the company from having to comply with the amended conditional use standards. The trial court affirmed the board of appeals' decision. The court held the board of appeals committed an error of law by applying &sect; 302 to relieve the company from complying with the conditional use standards of the amended ordinance. The ordinance went into effect before the board of appeals received and acted upon the company's application for a conditional use permit. Each permit application was a separate proceeding for the purpose of applying the grandfathering provision of &sect; 302, and the board of appeals and the trial court erred in treating the multi-step municipal approval process as a single proceeding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from an in limine order by the Cumberland County Superior Court (Maine), which denied the State's request for a proposed witness's statements to be admissible as nonhearsay even though it did not satisfy the requirements of Me. R. Evid. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A). The trial court ruled that the prior inconsistent statements would be admissible in defendant juvenile's murder trial for impeaching the witness's credibility only.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was awaiting trial on an indictment for murder under Me. Rev. Stat.

Viewed in light of the strong public policy considerations under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 2115-A(5), the court held that the State's appeal was improvident. The evidentiary question raised by the appeal could readily have been answered by study of the existing law. Me. R. Evid. 801(d) specifically limited the circumstances when a prior statement by a witness was not hearsay; and no amount of the liberal construction mandated by Me. R. Evid. 102 could transform the proposed witness's statements in connection with his polygraph test into statements given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing or other proceeding, or in a deposition under Me. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A). The court held that an interlocutory appeal that involved a question with an answer readily available from research was improvident and became even more obviously so when the answer was plainly adverse to the State.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect;&sect; 152, 201 (1983), and aggravated assault under &sect; 208 on the theory of accomplice liability under &sect; 57.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While working as a custodian at a high school, the principal in the crime acquired toxic chemicals from the chemistry storeroom and administered them to his mother on six separate occasions by mixing them in her medication capsules and her drinks. He conferred with defendant before and after each attempt. The juvenile court adjudicated defendant for being an accomplice in connection with the principal's attempts to poison his mother. Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his adjudication as an accomplice, on the basis that there was no evidence of an overt act on his part. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment. The court held that although an overt act as a predicate for accomplice liability was never expressly required, a degree of active participation was required. Neither mere condonation nor passive acquiescence alone sufficed and mere presence at the scene of a crime was inadequate to prove accomplice liability. The court held however that defendant became an accomplice by actively furnishing advice and encouragement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state trooper warned defendant that a harassment complaint was made against her and for her to not have any contact, verbal or otherwise, with the complainant.

The court affirmed the first conviction. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 506-A which made a person guilty of harassment if she engaged in conduct with the intent to harass another was constitutional under U.S. Const. amend. 1 because it was not overbroad where it proscribed unprotected speech or conduct. The court vacated the second conviction for insufficient evidence because, assuming without deciding that the district court judge was the proper official to warn defendant under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 506-A, the judge failed to give defendant a specific warning against any course of conduct with intent to harass the complainant as required by &sect; 506-A.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for speeding. A search of his vehicle produced a small vial and a plastic box that contained a small set of scales. A residue of white powder was found in both containers. The residue tested positive for cocaine. Defendant argued that the amount of cocaine found in the containers was so minute as to be insufficient to support a conviction under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 1107 (1983). The court held that although a previous version of &sect; 1107 required possession of a useable amount of a controlled drug to support a conviction, the current version of the statute permitted a person to be convicted for unlawful possession of any amount of cocaine. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the trial court deprived him an impartial trial by denying his challenges to potential jurors who had significant relationships with law enforcement officials. The court held that a mere connection with law enforcement did not require a juror's dismissal, that the trial court adequately inquired into potential juror bias during voir dire, and that the denial of defendant's challenges for cause did not constitute reversible error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board lowered the valuation of a utility's facility from that set by the bureau, which represented the fair market or just value of the facility, in order to &quot;equalize&quot; assessment of the facility with two similar facilities in other towns that were valued on a different basis because they were regulated by the public utilities commission. The bureau sought judicial review, and the court reversed a Superior Court decision that had affirmed the board. The board misconceived its role in the tax equalization process and it lacked any statutory authority to remedy a perceived inequality in the manner attempted. Once the board had determined the validity of the bureau's assessment of the facility at current market value, it was compelled to sustain the bureau's determination. The town's claim that the facility be assessed differently to compensate for the bureau's disparate treatment of regulated facilities located in other municipalities must be addressed in a different forum. Pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 305 (1987), neither the bureau, in assessing the Madison facility, nor the board, in fashioning a remedy, had the authority to deviate from fair market or just value.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 34-B, &sect;&sect; 3601-3606 (1988) in a Me. R. Civ. P. 80C action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The facility was fully licensed pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 34-B, &sect; 3606. When its license expired, the commissioner issued a conditional license pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat.

The facility sought judicial review of the commissioner's final decision pursuant to Me. R. Civ. P. 80C. The trial court affirmed the commissioner's decision. The facility contended that the act improperly delegated discretionary licensing and rulemaking authority to the commissioner in violation of the strict separation of powers mandated by Me. Const. art. III, &sect; 2. The court rejected that contention because of the statutory standards and procedural safeguards surrounding the commissioner's licensing and rulemaking authority. The facility also contended that the department's regulations for the licensing of local mental health facilities were unconstitutionally vague.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court, Kennebec County (Maine), which convicted him of escape from a mental health facility in violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 755(1) (1983). Defendant had been committed to the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Corrections, who placed him at the facility, after he was found not guilty of a murder charge by reason of mental disease or defect (BRI).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant left the mental health facility without permission, a grand jury indicted him for escape. Shortly after, he was arrested in another state. Eighteen months later, he was convicted and sentenced in the other state. Defendant was extradited to Maine seven years later and was tried for and convicted of escape. On appeal, the court affirmed. The language in the indictment was not confusing and adequately informed defendant of the crime charged. Escape from &quot;official custody&quot; under 755 encompassed an unauthorized departure from a mental health facility by a BRI acquittee. The Uniform Interstate Compact on Detainers, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 34-A, &sect;&sect; 9601-9636, did not place an affirmative duty on the charging state to seek custody of defendant for expeditious transport to the state. The eight years and eight months between defendant's indictment and his trial on the escape charge, although presumptively prejudicial, did not violate his constitutional right to a speedy trial. Although the delay was due in part to the State's inattention to the matter, defendant was not prejudiced by the delay and the extreme remedy of dismissal was not constitutionally demanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A proposed initiated ordinance amending the city's zoning ordinance was filed. The initiated ordinance expressly stated that, if enacted, its provisions would be applicable to all pending applications commenced after the filing date.

The project met the requirements of the city code then in force, but not the requirements of the initiated ordinance. Soon after the city planning board approved the developer's application, the initiated ordinance was passed. The city, the AG, and the WCC filed a declaratory action against the developer. The trial court ruled that the initiated ordinance did not apply to the developer's pending application, and that the developer was entitled to the issuance of the building permit. The city, the AG, and the WWC appealed. The court held that there was no statute that expressly or impliedly prohibited municipalities from applying ordinances retroactively. The retroactivity clause of the initiated ordinance was operative and therefore the developer, having filed its application after the effective date, was bound by the initiated ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The owners contended that Bangor, Me., Zoning Ordinance ch. VIII, art. 2, &sect; 2(c)-(d) was partially void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners objected to the board's decision to grant a special exemption for the establishment of a halfway house for mental patients on the grounds that two of the conditions in the city ordinance were unconstitutionally vague. In particular they challenged the standards relating to the general character of the neighborhood affected and that the exemption would have no significant effect upon the public health and welfare. On direct review, the court held that the owners had no ground for appellate relief. Even if the two contested standards were void for vagueness, the owners failed to demonstrate that they were aggrieved by the constitutional infirmity. Furthermore, the city zoning ordinance vested the code enforcement officer with the authority to decide whether an applicant was a community service organization and entitled to the special exemption. The owners' failure to challenge the officer's determination before the zoning board of appeals was a failure to exhaust all available administrative remedies and precluded judicial review.</SPAN></P>

All but three years of Count 1 were suspended, and defendant was placed on probation for a term of four years. The trial court imposed as a special condition of probation that the defendant &quot;cooperate fully to the satisfaction of the probation officer with law enforcement personnel with regard to trafficking in cocaine.&quot; Defendant moved to vacate the sentence, and the trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court vacated the sentence, holding that the special condition of probation was unconstitutionally vague on its face, and therefore illegal. The condition of probation was too indefinite to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair warning of the conduct it required. Without knowing the specific nature of the requisite cooperation, the defendant could not know what behavior would constitute a violation of the condition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance companies and the National Council on Compensation Insurance sought relief from the Superior Court, Kennebec County (Maine), which rejected their challenge to the constitutionality of a 1985 statute that mandated an immediate reduction in workers' compensation insurance rates, required participation in an assigned risk pool, and placed a limit on future rate increases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking judicial review of the Superintendent of Insurance's 8 percent reduction order in workers' compensation insurance rates. The complaint alleged that section 2355 of the Workers' Compensation Competitive Rating Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24-A, &sect;&sect; 2331-2357, violated constitutional due process by imposing confiscatory rates while denying the insurers an opportunity to apply for rate increases necessary to ensure a fair return. The complaint, in addition to seeking a declaratory judgment that section 2355 was unconstitutional, sought 1) an Me. R. Civ. P. 80C order reversing the 8 percent reduction orders or alternatively directing the Superintendent to permit workers' compensation rates to be raised to an &quot;adequate level&quot; and 2) an injunction against the Superintendent's exercising any of the powers respecting the enforcement of the rate reduction and rate limits of section 2355. While this appeal was pending, the legislature repealed the entire statute and substantially modified the Maine workers' compensation system in regard to both insurance rates and compensation benefit levels. Thus, the appeal became moot and the court dismissed it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's petition to change primary custody of the children to him was prompted by the mother's impending move from Maine to California. Seeking reversal of the judgment, he argued that &quot;the best interests of the child&quot; standard set forth in Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 752(5) was unconstitutionally vague, and that the trial court erred in: 1) failing to find the mother's impending move to be a sufficiently substantial change of circumstances to warrant a change in custody; and 2) refusing his requests to appoint an expert witness and to change his visitation schedule to allow a psychologist to confer with the children. The court affirmed the judgment, ruling that the factors set forth in &sect; 752(5) to consider in child custody cases were sufficiently specific to overcome the father's void-for-vagueness argument. The court emphasized that the decision of whether the move was a substantial change of circumstance justifying a modification of the custody award was committed to the sound judgment of the trial court and it found no abuse thereof or in the trial court's refusal to either appoint an expert witness or to modify the father's visitation schedule.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the planning board had no authority to decide questions concerning the zoning ordinance. The authority to make a zoning determination had to be expressly granted by statute or ordinance. The applicable statutes provided that zoning issues were to have been initially determined by the officer charged with enforcement of the zoning ordinance and the findings of that officer were subject to review by a zoning board of appeals.</SPAN></P>

The association raised numerous objections to the Commission's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court properly deferred to the Commission's determination that the petition initiating the review proceedings was complete. The record did not support the allegation that the Association was prejudiced by the assistant attorney general's behavior during the proceedings. The Commission's designation of its executive director to preside over the hearings was expressly authorized by Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 52 (1974); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &sect; 9062(1) (1979). There was no evidence establishing that the association's property was rendered substantially useless by the Commission's order, so there was no unconstitutional taking. The record adequately supported the Commission's findings of fact. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &sect; 11007(4)(C)(5) (1979). Turning to the cross-appeal, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 304(4) (Pamph. 1974-80), permitted provision for variations in water level but did not authorize the Commission to order structural modifications to a dam. No such authority reasonably could be inferred from the power to establish water levels because an adequate enforcement mechanism was provided under Me. Rev. Stat.

The Commission ruled that fire code violations in the restaurant were valid grounds under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 28, &sect; 252-A(2) (1986) for denial of the application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town denied the restaurant's application for renewal of its liquor license on the grounds that sewage violations existed, that numerous fire code violations existed, and the failure to permit inspection of the premises.

Ann. tit. 28, &sect; 252-A(2) (1986) for denial of the application. The superior court affirmed. On review, the restaurant sought to challenge the Commission's decision and also sought to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. Applying the same standard of review used by the superior court, the court could find no abuse of discretion, error of law, or findings not supported by substantial evidence. The court found sufficient evidence in the record to support the Commission's denial of the application due to fire hazards on the premises.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were the parents and sibling of a man accused of murder. Defendants refused to testify against him, asserting an intrafamilial testimonial privilege. After jury trials led to defendants' convictions and sentences, defendants appealed. The prosecution prevailed. The court declared that neither the United States nor the Maine Constitution recognized a privilege not to testify in court about communications between a child and his parents or between siblings. The court reiterated the rule that testimonial privileges were strictly construed because they operated in derogation of the fundamental maxim that the public had a right to every man's evidence. The court rejected defendants' contention that the origins for such a privilege could be found in the United States Supreme Court's privacy decisions. Under Maine law, the offense of criminal contempt did not require proof of a specific intent to obstruct justice, nor was the question of defendants' good or bad faith germane to the crime. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 155 did not limit the sentences available against defendants because the court proceeded against them under its inherent authority to punish criminal contempts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners sought variances for their respective lots to build residences thereon. Neither lot had access to a street. The Board denied the first owner's request but granted the second owner's request. On appeal, the court found that neither owner was exempt under Eliot, Me., Town Zoning Ordinance &sect; 404.1 from obtaining a variance before building on their lots because their lots did not comply with Eliot, Me., Town Zoning Ordinance &sect; 305(p)(2) as neither right of way serving either lot was the required width. The court further determined that neither owner was entitled to a variance. Both owners had constructive knowledge of the town's zoning restrictions before purchasing their property. Moreover, the second owner had actual knowledge of the town's zoning restriction because he purchased his property after the denial of the first owner's request for a variance and he was a party in interest to the decision denying the first owner's request. The court concluded that the board correctly denied the first owner's variance request but erred as a matter of law in granting the second owner's variance request because both owners' hardships were self-created.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the superior court's judgment with regard to the first owner. The court vacated the superior court's judgment with regard to the second owner and remanded to the superior court with instructions to enter a judgment vacating the board's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant property owners appealed a declaratory judgment and a summary judgment rendered by the Kennebec County Superior Court (Maine), which found that plaintiff, the Town of Fayette, had discontinued a road by abandonment, pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 3028, and retained a public easement, as defined in Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 3021.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon the Town's petition, the county commission discontinued the road but retained public access rights. The Town conveyed land abutting the road to the property owners' predecessors-in-interest. The current owners made road improvements, requesting the Town to reimburse them for maintenance expenses. The Town refused and filed a declaratory judgment action. The trial court declared the road discontinued by abandonment and determined that the Town had retained a public easement in the road, as defined in Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 3021. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the Town on the property owners' counterclaims for compensatory and punitive damages. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that, because no appeals had been taken from the commissioners' order discontinuing the road, the validity of the order could not be attacked by the original landowners' successors-in-interest. The order had the operative consequences intended by the commissioners, which was to discontinue the road but retain a public easement. The instant owners were unable to assert appellate rights that had been lost to their predecessors-in-interest.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 9, &sect; 5012 (1980), which required solicitors of funds for charitable organizations to disclose, at the time of solicitation, the financial allocations of contributions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The professional fund-raising corporation was a for-profit corporation that planned, promoted, and operated fundraising events for its clients. During various fund-raising events, the corporation failed to disclose certain information concerning the allocation of contributions to potential ticket buyers. The trial court found that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 9, &sect; 5012, which required such disclosure, was unconstitutionally overbroad under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment. On appeal, the court concluded that the premises upon which &sect; 5012 was predicated were untenable and, as a result, the statute, in all of its applications, unnecessarily intruded upon rights protected by the First Amendment. It was on that basis that the statute should have been struck down as unconstitutional. The lack of logical congruency between the statute's design and the state's interest that it sought to further made inescapable the conclusion that the statute, in all of its applications, was an unacceptable and unnecessary intrusion upon First Amendment rights. As a result, the statute was unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that, based on the unconstitutionality of &sect; 1254(3) on which petitioner received additional good time credits, the retroactive revocation of those credits by the Department of Corrections worked no constitutional violation. The court found that &sect; 1253(3) was an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power in conflict with the exclusive power of the executive to commute sentences, in violation of the separation of powers provision of the Maine Constitution, art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, the landowners questioned the validity of the original zoning and sufficiency of the evidence to support the fine. In the second case, they challenged the LURC's decision as unsupported by substantial evidence and on constitutional grounds. The court affirmed the judgment on the second case, but remanded the judgment on the first case because the fine was incorrectly assessed. As to the first case, the court rejected the LURC's argument each tree cut was a separate violation. Cutting timber without a permit exposed the landowners to a maximum fine for each day of the violation under &sect; 685-C (8). As to the second case, the evidence adequately supported the LURC's decision to retain the wildlife habitat protection zone in preference to the landowner's proposal to convert the area to pasture land, and it failed to support the landowner's claim of a taking.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, vacated the sentence, and remanded for resentencing. The trial court properly granted the State's motion in limine to exclude evidence of defendants' &quot;competing harms&quot; justification defense because the motion was not used to exclude relevant, admissible evidence. The competing harms defense was not available as a basis for justifying acts of civil disobedience, and, even if it was, it was inapplicable because the threat cited was not imminent and defendants' acts did not directly lessen the threat. Any error from the arguable incorrect instruction on &quot;license or privilege&quot; to excuse criminal trespass did not affect defendants' substantial rights because they did not believe that they were licensed to trespass onto the property. It was error to impose a more severe sentence, by way of a fine to recoup the costs of a jury trial, based on the defendants' choice to exercise their right to a trial by jury. The trial court enumerated none of the purposes of punishment that were considered by it in imposing the fines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Kennebec County (Maine), which affirmed the decision of the Secretary of State that defendant's driving record brought him within the definition of habitual offender under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 2292 (Supp. 1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was notified that his operator's license was revoked because of his status as an habitual offender. Defendant's case was heard by a hearing examiner. Defendant challenged the use of a prior violation under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 1312-C (repealed 1985) because that section had been declared unconstitutional. The hearing examiner declined to entertain the argument on the ground that the issues before him were limited by statute to consideration of identity and driving record, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 2294(2) (Supp. 1985). On subsequent review, the Superior Court affirmed, and this appeal followed. The court held that defendant was adjudged to have engaged in proscribed conduct. The imposition of civil disability based in part upon that adjudication offended neither defendant's constitutional rights nor the integrity of the judicial process. Revocation of the habitual offender's license was not itself a criminal proceeding. It involved neither the imposition of an incarceration penalty nor any enhancement of the criminal penalty for a later violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 2298.</SPAN></P>

The employer appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer argued that the wives of deceased ex-employees should not have been allowed to recover damages because damages were not available under the state Wrongful Death Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 18 &sect; 2-804, in an action based on Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14 &sect; 221 and the employer argued that state-of-the-art evidence was improperly excluded at trial. The court found that the employer should have been able to introduce state-of-the-art evidence to show that they neither knew nor reasonably could have known of the dangerous characteristics of asbestos, and that damages were recoverable under &sect; 221. Under &sect; 221, when the product defect alleged was a failure to warn, the employer could have introduced evidence to show that they neither knew nor reasonably could have known, of the dangerous characteristics of asbestos. The court also concluded that &sect; 221 did not impose absolute liability. Accordingly, state-of-the-art evidence was relevant in determining whether the employer was liable in a failure-to-warn- case based on &sect; 221.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Kennebec County (Maine) convicted defendant of murder on the &quot;depraved indifference&quot; charge and of manslaughter on the &quot;knowing&quot; murder charge, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After finding his wife in bed with another man, defendant fired a shotgun through a front door knowing that the adults and five children were inside and killed one of the children who was descending the stairs when the shots were fired. The court held that the depraved indifference provisions in &sect; 201(1)(B) were not rendered unconstitutionally vague by the enactment of subsection 1-A. The court reasoned that &sect; 201(1)(B) (1-A) gave fair notice of the conduct it was intended to proscribe and was in accordance with the court's prior decisions regarding similar language that had already withstood constitutional scrutiny. In addition, &sect; 201(1)(B) (1-A) was not arbitrary on the ground that it was not rationally distinguishable from the crime of manslaughter because the two crimes were constitutionally distinguishable even though they differed only in degree. A medical expert's legal conclusions were properly excluded, an instruction on the insanity defense was not required in the absence of evidence that defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect, and no rational basis existed to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of aggravated assault.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, finding that defendant's speech was subject to reasonable restrictions as to time, place, and manner. Defendant had become irate while at a voter registration facility and had refused to leave the premises. The court held that the voter registration facility was a nonpublic forum. As such, the governmental interest in maintaining an orderly setting for the prompt and efficient screening and registration of voters during the hours when the polls were still open outweighed any constitutional right defendant might have had in expressing his displeasure with the town and its voter registration process. Defendant's speech could be restricted as long as the restrictions were reasonable and were not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials opposed his view.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals appellant State of Maine sought review of orders of the District Court for Cumberland County (Maine), which set aside appellee drivers' civil operating under the influence (OUI) adjudications on the ground that the civil OUI statute,&nbsp;Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 29, &sect; 1312-C (Supp. 1984), was held to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

The trial court granted the motions. The court vacated the judgment determining that the burden of relitigating civil OUI adjudications outweighed the concerns raised by the drivers. To hold all past civil OUI adjudications null and void would have left many of the former adjudicants open to criminal prosecution. Furthermore, efforts to relitigate after substantial passage of time would likely have been difficult and burdensome on judicial and prosecutorial resources. In reconciling the competing interests involved, the court determined that the burden of relitigating civil OUI adjudications far exceeded the interests of the drivers in eradicating traffic infractions, albeit based upon an unconstitutional statute.</SPAN></P>

The factory contacted its employees' union and began discussions regarding a reopening of the factory and an agreement between the factory and the union. The proposed agreement included a provision to shield the factory from having to pay severance pay to the union employees in the event that the factory reopened. The factory did not reopen, and several former employees filed an action against the factory for severance pay. The Director of the Bureau of Labor Standards also filed an action to enforce Maine's severance pay law, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit, 26, &sect; 625-B as to all of the factory's former employees. The trial court found that the eligible employees were entitled to severance pay. The factory sought review. The court found that &sect; 625-B was not preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C.S &sect; 1001 et seq. or the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 157 and 158, and that the trial court properly denied the factory a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the district court, defendant was found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs and vehicular manslaughter. The superior court denied his appeal, and he sought review, arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress his breath test results. The court found that the result of the blood-alcohol test was lawfully obtained and that its relevancy was unquestioned. Thus, the district court had properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. Defendant also argued that the district had court erred in permitting a witness to testify to a statement he had made describing defendant's condition because it was hearsay. The court held that the statement fell squarely within the language of Me. R. Evid. 803(1) because the witness was describing a condition while he was perceiving it. Defendant further argued that the district court erroneously excluded his statement about the cause of the accident, which was made approximately seven minutes after the accident occurred.

The court rejected defendant's Second Amendment claim because the court found that the Amendment did not restrict the power of the states to regulate firearms. The court stated that &sect; 393 did not violate the Maine Constitution because the regulation was within the Legislature's power to enact laws for the benefit of the people. The court noted that defendant failed to meet his burden of proof regarding his challenge to the denial of his motion to suppress.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate, convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison in 1951 as mandated by Me. Rev. Stat. ch. 117, &sect; 1 (1944), sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court, Cumberland County (Maine), dismissing his petition for post-conviction relief in light of the effect of the parole provisions of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 34-A, &sect; 5801 et seq. (Supp. 1985-1986), on the Governor's exclusive constitutional power to commute sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was paroled after serving 18 years in prison but in 1975 his parole was revoked upon his conviction of aggravated assault and battery. In his petition, the inmate challenged the validity of the revocation of his parole and the legality of his 1975 sentence. The trial court held that the application of post-1951 amendments to the parole statute to the inmate infringed upon the Governor's exclusive constitutional power under Me. Const. art. V, pt. 1, &sect; 11 to commute sentences after conviction. On review, the court held that, because of the inherent differences between parole and commutation, a grant of parole to the inmate on the authority of amendments passed after his conviction, which were generally encompassed within Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 34-A, &sect; 5801 et seq. (Supp. 1985-1986), did not amount to a commutation of his sentence in violation of the separation of powers. However, application of the discharge provision of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 34-A, &sect; 5809 (Supp. 1985-1986) to the inmate would act as a commutation of the inmate's sentence and usurp the Governor's exclusive power, but these provisions of the statutes were severable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment dismissing the inmate's petition and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was granted a default judgment against the insured after the insured failed to appear on his behalf. The insurer then learned of the malpractice action against its insured and was afforded notice of the damages phase of the trial. The claimant was awarded damages, which he sought to recover against the insurer. The insurer raised the defense of lack of cooperation. The court noted that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24-A, &sect; 2904 (1974) defines and limits the scope of reach and apply actions and the Legislature intended the defenses enumerated in &sect; 2904 to be an exclusive list. The court determined that the insurer's defense of lack of cooperation by the insured was not listed under &sect; 2904. The court also rejected the insurer's claim that it was denied due process because it did not receive notice of the malpractice action until after the insured had suffered the entry of default. The court reasoned that the lower court's entry of default against the insured could have been set aside upon a showing of good cause and therefore the insurer was given proper notice and opportunity to be heard prior to the hearing on damages.</SPAN></P>

Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Me. Rev.

The court found that &sect; 2243-C discriminated against interstate commerce because it levied taxes on certain foreign-registered trucks that it did not assess against Maine-registered trucks. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment finding that Maine's reciprocal truck taxes had to be struck down as a violation of the Commerce Clause in the absence of any complementary or compensating tax on Maine-registered trucks to offset the discriminatory effect of &sect; 2243-C. The court also upheld the trial court's rejection of the out-of-state truckers' claim to refunds of pre-escrow tax payments because their payments were not made under duress or compulsion because failure to pay would not have produced irreparable injury. The court also found that the Commerce Clause did not secure the out-of-state truckers rights within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and that the trial court properly concluded that they could not recover attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the scene of an accident, an officer observed that a passenger in defendant's automobile lay dead beside the highway, empty beer bottles littered defendant's car, defendant smelled of alcohol and admitted to drinking, defendant displayed slurred speech and bloodshot eyes, and defendant appeared to stagger. Further, the officer concluded that the accident occurred because defendant ran a stop sign. Even though he was not under arrest, defendant was taken to a hospital, and although he objected, a warrantless blood alcohol test was conducted. The court held that the existence of an arrest was not crucial to the admissibility of the blood test. Rather, because there was probable cause, based on the observations of the officer, and exigent circumstances, because the human body continually eliminated alcohol from the blood, the blood test constituted a permissible warrantless search. The court also held that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 1312 did not exclude reliable blood test results because the test was administered after defendant's refusal, where they were in conformity with constitutional requirements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the state tax assessor and others, appealed a judgment of the Superior Court, Kennebec County (Maine), in favor of plaintiff landowners in their suit to have the Maine Forest Fire Suppression Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect;&sect; 2711-1714 (Supp. 1984-85) declared unconstitutional for violating Me. Const. art. IX, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The assessor alleged that the Act imposed an excise tax on business, not a tax on real property, and was not subject to art. IX, &sect; 8. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect;&sect; 2711(1), (2)(B), and 2714(1) imposed a standard per acre tax on unexempt protected land and characterized the tax as an excise tax. Each landowner had an exemption of 500 acres in each municipality or unorganized territory. Certain landowners sued to challenge the tax, and the trial court found the Act unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that because the definition of protected land included land of various economic uses, e.g. forests, blueberry bogs, and pastureland, as well as land or no economic use, e.g. swamps, because the Act did not focus on a business or use, and because, under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 2714(2) (Supp. 1984-85), the tax was enforceable by a lien that attached to the land when the tax became due, the tax in the Act was not an excise tax on business but a property tax on land. Thus, the Act's imposition of a standard rate tax and not a tax apportioned and assessed according to the value of the land violated Me. Const. art. IX, &sect; 8 and was thus unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

They argued that because their application met the requirements of the Sand Dune Regulations, the Board erred as a matter of law in denying their application. Further, they claimed that the trial court's grant of the Board's motion to dismiss their unconstitutional taking of property claim for failure to state a claim was in error because they asserted that without approval of their application for a sand dune permit, the property is rendered substantially useless. The court affirmed the Board's decision because it concluded that substantial evidence supported the Board's determination. However, the trial court erred in dismissing their unconstitutional taking claim because the complaint was sufficient to state a claim under which facts could have been proved that would entitle them to some relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained only that portion of the landowner's appeal of the dismissal of their unconstitutional taking of property claim, vacated the dismissal, and remanded the case for further proceedings on that issue alone. The court affirmed the Board's determination that denied the landowners' application to construct a seasonal cottage. The rest of the judgment may stand.</SPAN></P>

The widow appealed a jury's verdict in favor of defendant town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow's decedent was operating a motorcycle on a rural state highway when he reached a Y-shaped intersection with an improved state aid highway and collided head-on with a Chevrolet Blazer whose driver's view was obstructed by a knoll and brush. After the accident, the state corrected the defect by changing the rural state highway. The State unsuccessfully sought immunity under the Maine Tort Claims Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect;&sect; 8101-8118 (1977), prior to and during trial. A jury found the driver 40 percent liable and the State 60 percent liable, and did not find the town liable. On appeal, the court vacated the judgment against the State by holding that the superior court erred in failing to grant the State's motion for JNOV. The State was immune from suit on the tort claim under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 8103(2), and the two limited exceptions were inapplicable to the widow's action. As the State, and not the town, was obliged by law to maintain both highways, the town was not liable under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 3655, and any error committed by the superior court in allowing the jury to decide if the town was obligated to repair the road was harmless.</SPAN></P>

The court found that violations of the ordinance were civil rather than criminal in nature. It then addressed defendants' two-pronged constitutional challenge and refused to extend constitutional protection to obscene expression that did not meet federal protection . The court concluded that the city ordinance did not infringe on freedom of expression.

The board ruled that the term &quot;kept&quot; meant &quot;allowed to graze or roam.&quot; The landowner claimed that the term meant &quot;housed or kept in a shelter.&quot; The landowner also claimed that if the word &quot;kept&quot; as used in the zoning ordinance meant &quot;allowed to graze or roam,&quot; the 50-foot setback provision was so unreasonable as to be unconstitutional.

After the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Commission on the ground that the employee's personal injury suit was barred by the two-year statute of limitations, the employee argued on appeal that the 1945 law creating the Commission and the 1947 law affirming the Commission's status as a state agency violated Me. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 13 and 14. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the Maine Legislature, by enacting 1947 Me. Laws 97, clearly affirmed that the Commission was a state agency. The court held that it was therefore of no consequence how the Commission was originally created or what status it had before 1947. Further, the court held that the trial court correctly rejected the employee's argument that the 1947 law violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Maine and federal constitutions.

The court held that one business lacked the standing necessary to bring their suit because it had no ownership interest or irrevocable option to purchase the land that it sought develop. The court found that the record demonstrated the existence of genuine issues of material fact, which rendered summary judgment inappropriate. The court concluded that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the town was faced with an emergency in the provision of public services of a nature to justify its enactment of a moratorium on development. Witnesses testified that growth was not threatening to overload the town's utilities, contrary to the language of the statute.

The court affirmed on appeal, finding that (1) the Solicitation Law was constitutional in that the State had a significant interest in regulating the activities of law enforcement entities, (2) solicitation by the MSTA was inherently coercive, (3) solicitation by the MSTA eroded public confidence in the integrity of law enforcement personnel, (4) the Solicitation Law was not overbroad, and (5) because game wardens had some latitude with respect to distributions, the MSTA was entitled to that same latitude under the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment because it found that the planning board's action far exceeded the bounds of &quot;encouraging&quot; recreation. Approval of the reservoir project hinged on the district's cooperation in allowing the public to use the site for recreational purposes. The planning board sought to force the district to bear a disproportionate burden in the providing of public facilities. The record was void of any evidence indicating that the public held a legal right to use the area in question for recreational activities, including fishing, boating, and nature viewing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was stopped after an officer observed the driver operating his vehicle in an erratic manner. The driver was administered a chemical test, which showed his blood alcohol level to be .16 percent. The state suspended his license. The driver filed a complaint for a temporary restraining order. The trial court remanded to the state for a full hearing. The driver participated and again the State suspended his license. Thereafter, suit was initiated alleging a claim under &sect; 1983. The trial court dismissed the claim and affirmed the suspension. On appeal, the court affirmed. First, the court held that the trial court lacked authority to remand to the State for a second hearing; however, the driver did not object and fully participated in the second hearing and, thus, waived any defects and could not now maintain a &sect; 1983 claim. Second, the court concluded that the officer had probable cause to believe that the driver was operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated based on the officer's observation.

A jury returned a guilty verdict to a charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

First, the court noted that the trial court properly refused to rule upon the qualifications of the chemist as an expert witness in advance of his testimony.

The superior court declined to address the merits of defendants' contentions and held the last sentence of &sect; 1253(3) was an unconstitutional legislative encroachment on the executive's commutation power. On appeal, defendants contended superior court erred in deciding the recently enacted statutory formula for the calculation of good-time reductions in prior sentences, codified in &sect; 1253(3), was an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power. The court affirmed the denial of defendants' petition because &sect; 1253(3) shortened the lengths of existing sentences and did not merely change the computation of sentences to be imposed, and thus, &sect; 1253(3) was an interference with the executive branch's explicit and exclusive grant of the commutation power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Committee on Judicial Responsibility and Disability filed a report that alleged that defendant, a district court judge, violated the Maine Code of Judicial Conduct in seven cases, and that the violations warranted formal disciplinary action. The judge was alleged to have violated Me. Code of Judicial Conduct Canons 2A and 3A(1). The judge denied the allegations. The case was tried on questions of both fact and law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge was charged with illegally incarcerating a number of persons summoned into his court. He was placed on administrative suspension until the allegations were tried on their merits. The court rejected the case by case approach used by other jurisdictions to determine misconduct. Instead, it held that the appropriate objective test for determining whether a judge's conduct violated Canon 3A(1) was whether a reasonably prudent and competent judge would have considered the conduct obviously and seriously wrong in all the circumstances. The court found that in three instances, the judge had committed such serious wrongs when he jailed three individuals who were before him in civil cases. The court found that it had inherent power to prescribe the conduct of judges in state courts and to discipline them for misconduct. In selecting the appropriate sanction, the court considered the absence of any hint that personal gain or benefit motivated the judge's actions. However, the court rejected the judge's contention that he could not be subjected to a monetary sanction because Me. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2 provided that his compensation could not be diminished while he was in office.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court censured the judge for three violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct.

The court held that there was sufficient evidence from which a trier of fact could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. &quot;But for&quot; defendant's robbery of the victim and the immediate sequels to it of chasing defendant and recounting the distressing episode to the police, the victim would not have died of heart failure. Any concurrent cause attributable to the victim's predisposition to heart problems on account of his severe ateriosclerotic condition was not alone sufficient to produce his death. The court also ruled that a 14 year prison term for felony murder, coupled with a similar, concurrent term for the robbery, was not disproportionate to the offense of criminal homicide or offended any prevailing notion of decency or fairness.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 3153 and 3154 (Supp. 1983-1984), unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Maine milk producers were a membership corporation of dairy farmers who sold their milk to Maine dealers. Maine dairy farmers sold their milk to dealers in two different regulated markets, the Boston market and the Maine market. The stated purpose of the Milk Pool Act, 7 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3151 (Supp. 1983-1984) was to even out price disparities between the two markets. The trial court found that that Act was unconstitutional. On review, the court reversed. The Act did not violate the equal tax and equal protection clauses of the Maine Constitution. When properly understood as a regulatory device for setting the prices received by Maine dairy farmers for their milk, the milk pool was seen not to involve a tax. Although the deductions made against the producers' shares in the pool constituted taxes imposed to pay for the State's promotional efforts, the burden of those promotion taxes fell on all producers evenly on the basis of the volume of their production. There was nothing unconstitutional in requiring the milk pool to bear its own administrative costs.</SPAN></P>

Upon the conclusion of the State's opening statement, defendant moved for a mistrial, alleging that the State placed an unconstitutional burden on defendant to testify by suggesting that the jury was to compare defendant's testimony to that of other witnesses. The trial court granted the mistrial and dismissed the indictment against defendant. The court found that the dismissal was improper where defendant made no motion for dismissal and delay in commencing the trial in question transpired from defendant's own successful motions for continuance. Based on the statements of the prosecutor, mistrial was proper, but dismissal of the claim was not a proper sanction.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court, Kennebec County (Maine) denied preliminary injunctive relief against defendant Secretary of State, and plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As of the deadline, plaintiffs did not have the 4,000 signatures required by Me. Rev. Stat.

Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 495, and plaintiffs had not completed the collection of signatures. At the hearing, the Secretary's witnesses testified that, in order to have the ballots ready on time, all of the information had to be given to the printers by the first week in September. Noting that plaintiffs were requesting the extraordinary relief of an appeal from an interlocutory order, the court pointed out that plaintiffs did not made any further progress toward complying with the statute's requirements of verified signatures and had only partially fulfilled the requirement of signed consents. The court ruled that the requirement for access to the ballots did not unfairly burden their political opportunity. The court explained that there was no relief that it could have provided that would have entitled them to be placed on the November ballot, short of invalidating all of the requirements for candidacy, which the court would not have done.</SPAN></P>

Although the application attempted to justify an average rate increase of 110.1 percent, the organization limited its formal rate request to a 27.5 percent average increase in the statewide level of workers' compensation insurance premiums with various proposed increases for particular industry groups based on past claims experience. No separate analysis was presented to support the 27.5 percent increase. Instead, the organization relied on the data and methodology provided in the application to support the 110.1 figure. Several Maine employers and a union intervened in the proceedings. After a public hearing, the Superintendent issued his decision denying the requested rate increase. The superior court upheld the decision on appeal. The organization appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the Superintendent's finding that the organization failed to establish that any profit factor used would produce only a just and reasonable return of the investment allocable to the coverage of risks under &sect; 22(3)(B)(1) was supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was spotted by the police officer while driving slowly on a country road. Although the officer subsequently believed that defendant had a gun in his hand when he was observed outside his automobile, it became apparent to the officer as he moved closer that this was not in fact the case. The officer nevertheless accosted defendant and asked him for identification. After the officer was advised that there were no warrants outstanding against defendant, but that he was a habitual offender in Maine, the officer informed defendant that he was under arrest for driving while a habitual offender. He also told defendant that he never would have stopped him had defendant gone into the woods to urinate instead of doing so in the middle of the road. The court ruled that the trial court erred in not granting defendant's motion to suppress because defendant had been subjected to an unconstitutional seizure of his person in violation of the Fourth Amendment when he was initially stopped by the officer and asked for identification. The officer had a duty to discontinue the investigation and forego a Terry-type stop when the justification for his initial suspicion ceased to exist.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's eyes were bloodshot, his balance was impaired, his speech was slurred and accented by long pauses, and he was unable to perform a field sobriety test. Admission of evidence of defendant's refusal to take either a breath or a blood test was not grounds for reversal, despite defendant's claim that it violated his right against self-incrimination under Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, because defendant did not move to suppress the refusal, object at trial to its introduction, or demonstrate that the alleged error deprived him of a fair trial. Neither admission of testimony of the search and seizure of defendant's car nor the jury instructions regarding the effect of defendant's refusal was a sufficient basis for vacating the conviction because no objection was presented to the trial court and the error, if any, did not rise to the level of obvious error that affected defendant's substantial rights.

When the student turned 18 years old, he obtained legal counsel. A claim was served on the city and more than five years after the accident the student sued defendants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, the only witness was the young prosecutrix, who was subjected to aggressive cross-examination by defense counsel. In considering defendant's claimed reform and repentance, the sentencing court took into account what defendant had put the girl through at trial. The court initially held that defendant could raise on direct appeals from his conviction and the denial of his motion for correction of sentence the claim that the sentencing court relied upon an improper consideration in imposing sentence. Defendant's claim of error went to the legality of the sentencing decision, and any error would appear plainly on the face of the appeal record. The court found no reversible error, concluding that the sentencing court properly took into account defendant's going to trial only for the legitimate purpose of testing the genuineness of defendant's claim at sentencing of personal reform and contrition. The sentencing transcript showed that the judge considered the gravity of the offense, its relation to the victim of the crime, defendant's background, his remorse and repentance, his receptivity to rehabilitation, and the interest of the public in retribution and deterrence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment for and awarded attorney's fees to the bank. On appeal, the court modified by striking the order for attorney's fees and otherwise affirmed. The trial court correctly concluded that the &quot;prime plus one percent&quot; referred to the prime of the lender bank. Further, the trial court was fully justified in concluding that the bank's prime rate was not subject to arbitrary adjustment at its whim. The parties, fully aware of the consequences of their action, agreed to an interest rate pegged at one percentage point above the prime rate of the bank. The note thus contained an enforceable agreement in writing establishing a different rate of interest than the six percent maximum that was otherwise prescribed in Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 9-B, &sect; 432(1). The bank voluntarily chose not to pursue the avenue of relief granted in the note. The right to attorney's fees as contractual was strictly limited to actions taken pursuant to that contract. Thus, the trial court erred in relying on the note to award attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 6204 (1980), the mortgagee sold the property to a third party and retained all proceeds from the sale. The mortgagor sought an accounting of the proceeds of the sale and recovery of the surplus, relying on Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 6204-A (1980). The lower court granted the mortgagee's motion to dismiss the complaint. The mortgagor appealed and the court affirmed. The court noted that there was some ambiguity in &sect; 6204-A in its reference to foreclosures &quot;under this subchapter,&quot; but adopted the construction that a sale following strict foreclosure under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 6203 (1980) was not a sale within the purview of the statute. The court found, therefore, that the statute did not create a cause of action for an accounting and recovery of surplus from the sale of property acquired under strict foreclosure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed three orders of the Superior Court of Penobscot County (Maine), which convicted defendant of two counts of operating a motor vehicle while a revocation prohibiting its operation for being an habitual offender was in effect and for giving a false name to the police.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his three convictions, and contended that: (1) his earlier acquittal of the charge of operating while his driver's permit was under revocation for being an habitual offender precluded the Secretary of State from reclassifying him an habitual offender, (2) that it was unconstitutional to imprison him for operating while an habitual offender, because his reclassification as such was based in part on a prior uncounseled conviction, and (3) his conviction for giving a false name was reversible error because of police misconduct in illegally seizing evidence of his true identity. The court denied the appeal and held that defendant was not permitted to use the instant proceeding to collaterally attack his earlier reclassification because defendant did not attack the administrative classification on direct appeal of the Secretary of State's decision. The court held that the use of an uncounseled conviction of OUI as the basis in part for imposing a civil motor-vehicle-operation disability, enforceable by a criminal sanction of imprisonment for his subsequent misconduct, did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for operating a motor vehicle while a revocation prohibiting its operation for being an habitual offender was in effect and for giving a false name to the police.</SPAN></P>
